EU GDPR 2016.5.4.txt,"I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 16 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3), Whereas: (1)  The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. (2)  The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons. (3)  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of personal data between Member States. 4.5.2016 L 119/1 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)OJ C 229, 31.7.2012, p. 90. (2)OJ C 391, 18.12.2012, p. 127. (3)Position of the European Parliament of 12 March 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and position of the Council at first reading of 8 April 2016 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Position of the European Parliament of 14 April 2016. (4)Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). (4)  The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. (5)  The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. (6)  Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data. (7)  Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced. (8)  Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law. (9)  The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. (10)  In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (11)  Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States. (12)  Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data. (13)  In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1). (14)  The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. (15)In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo­gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation. (16)  This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union. (17)  Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation. (18)  This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or 4.5.2016 L 119/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium‑sized enterprises (C(2003) 1422) (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). (2)Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1). household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. (19)  The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation. With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories. (20)  While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision- making. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations. (21)  This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive. That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between Member States. (22)  Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. 4.5.2016 L 119/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal). (2)Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1). (23)  In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. (24)  The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. (25)  Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post. (26)  The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. (27)  This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons. (28)  The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudony­misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29)In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi­sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (30)  Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them. (31)  Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis­trative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. (32)  Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided. (33)  It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose. (34)  Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. (35)  Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test. (36)  The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be 4.5.2016 L 119/6 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross‑border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45). the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. (37)  A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings. (38)  Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. (39)  Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi­cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. (40)  In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or 4.5.2016 L 119/7 Official Journal of the European Union EN     Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. (41)  Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) and the European Court of Human Rights. (42)  Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent pre- formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. (43)  In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance. (44)  Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a contract. (45)  Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association. (46)  The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data 4.5.2016 L 119/8 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p. 29). based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. (47)  The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest. (48)  Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected. (49)  The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems. (50)  The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their 4.5.2016 L 119/9 Official Journal of the European Union EN     further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations. Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. (51)  Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systemati­cally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms. (52)  Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. (53)  Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes 4.5.2016 L 119/10 Official Journal of the European Union EN     by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons. Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data. (54)  The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies. (55)  Moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest. (56)  Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established. (57)  If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the data controller. (58)  The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand. (59)  Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests. 4.5.2016 L 119/11 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70). (60)  The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable. (61)  The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided. (62)  However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a dispropor­tionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration. (63)  A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates. (64)  The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests. (65)  A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given 4.5.2016 L 119/12 Official Journal of the European Union EN     his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. (66)  To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's request. (67)  Methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system. (68)  To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another. (69)  Where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. (70)  Where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information. 4.5.2016 L 119/13 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (71)  The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes ‘profiling’ that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child. In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should be allowed only under specific conditions. (72)  Profiling is subject to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European Data Protection Board established by this Regulation (the ‘Board’) should be able to issue guidance in that context. (73)  Restrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data, the right to data portability, the right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the communication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, including the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters, the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions, other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general public interest, further processing of archived personal data to provide specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, including social protection, public health and humanitarian purposes. Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. (74)  The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. 4.5.2016 L 119/14 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (75)  The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects. (76)  The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment, by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk. (77)  Guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing, their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer. The Board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address such risk. (78)  The protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders. (79)  The protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller. (80)  Where a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the 4.5.2016 L 119/15 Official Journal of the European Union EN     nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The rep­resentative should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed by any supervisory authority. The representative should be explicitly designated by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such a rep­resentative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under this Regulation. Such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor, including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard to any action taken to ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor. (81)  To ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge, reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the subject- matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The controller and processor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing on behalf of the controller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller, return or delete the personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject. (82)  In order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might serve for monitoring those processing operations. (83)  In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material or non-material damage. (84)  In order to enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing. (85)  A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes 4.5.2016 L 119/16 Official Journal of the European Union EN     aware that a personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours, the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. (86)  The controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication. (87)  It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation. (88)  In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investi­gation of the circumstances of a personal data breach. (89)  Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing. (90)  In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compliance with this Regulation. (91)  This should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights. A data 4.5.2016 L 119/17 Official Journal of the European Union EN     protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale. The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory. (92)  There are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal activity. (93)  In the context of the adoption of the Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities. (94)  Where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation, including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority, in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. (95)  The processor should assist the controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority. (96)  A consultation of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data subject. (97)  Where the processing is carried out by a public authority, except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale, or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences, a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out 4.5.2016 L 119/18 Official Journal of the European Union EN     and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner. (98)  Associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. (99)  When drawing up a code of conduct, or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders, including data subjects where feasible, and have regard to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations. (100)  In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services. (101)  Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor. (102)  This Regulation is without prejudice to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or in­ternational organisations, as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects. (103)  The Commission may decide with effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authoris­ation. The Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision. (104)  In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country, take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access to justice as well as in­ternational human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security, defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of 4.5.2016 L 119/19 Official Journal of the European Union EN     protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress. (105)  Apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations. (106)  The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources. The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the Council. (107)  The Commission may recognise that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules, and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation. (108)  In the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective adminis­trative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are not legally binding. (109)  The possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the 4.5.2016 L 119/20 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13). standard data-protection clauses in a wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor, nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection clauses. (110)  A group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers from the Union to organisations within the same group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such corporate rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data. (111)  Provisions should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, regardless of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court procedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients, taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject. (112)  Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations, between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport. A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject. (113)  Transfers which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number of data subjects, could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those interests are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer. The controller should give particular considera­tion to the nature of the personal data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into con­sideration. The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject about the transfer. (114)  In any case, where the Commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards. 4.5.2016 L 119/21 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (115)  Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. (116)  When personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity and in accordance with this Regulation. (117)  The establishment of supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure. (118)  The independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review. (119)  Where a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission. (120)  Each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget, which may be part of the overall state or national budget. (121)  The general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should be laid down by law in each Member State and should in particular provide that those members are to be appointed, by means of a transparent procedure, either by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament or a chamber of the parliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member State law. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority, the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that is incompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office, engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory authority should have its own staff, chosen by the supervisory authority or an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority. (122)  Each supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member State to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the 4.5.2016 L 119/22 Official Journal of the European Union EN     processing in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its own Member State, the processing of personal data carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest, processing affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller or processor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing on its territory. This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject, conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. (123)  The supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose, the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission, without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of mutual assistance or on such cooperation. (124)  Where the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation, the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection. (125)  The lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part, that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged. (126)  The decision should be agreed jointly by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the Union. (127)  Each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State. In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned (‘one-stop-shop mechanism’), or whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level. When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-à-vis the controller or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case, the supervisory authority which informed it should have the 4.5.2016 L 119/23 Official Journal of the European Union EN     possibility to submit a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism. (128)  The rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority or private body is established. (129)  In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons, and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision. (130)  Where the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation. In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines, take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent supervisory authority. (131)  Where another supervisory authority should act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under Member State law. (132)  Awareness-raising activities by supervisory authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context. 4.5.2016 L 119/24 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (133)  The supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority. (134)  Each supervisory authority should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond to the request within a specified time period. (135)  In order to ensure the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established. That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties. (136)  In applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue, in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation. (137)  There may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three months. (138)  The application of such mechanism should be a condition for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases of cross- border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering the consistency mechanism. (139)  In order to promote the consistent application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality. The Board should be represented by its Chair. It should replace the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory authority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or their respective representatives. The Commission should participate in the Board's activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks. (140)  The Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation should perform its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of the Board. (141)  Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance 4.5.2016 L 119/25 Official Journal of the European Union EN     with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject. The investi­gation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding other means of communication. (142)  Where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed, he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate, and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That body, organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf indepen­dently of the data subject's mandate. (143)  Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. Where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation. Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down in Article 263 TFEU. (144)  Where a court seized of proceedings against a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing by the same controller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought before a competent court in another Member State, it should contact that court in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If related proceedings are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the court first 4.5.2016 L 119/26 Official Journal of the European Union EN     seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consoli­dation of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings. (145)  For proceedings against a controller or processor, the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. (146)  The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered. Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing. (147)  Where specific rules on jurisdiction are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking a judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor, general jurisdiction rules such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should not prejudice the application of such specific rules. (148)  In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of Union law and the Charter, including effective judicial protection and due process. (149)  Member States should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation, including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within the limits of this Regulation. Those criminal penalties may also allow for the deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this Regulation. However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court of Justice. (150)  In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this Regulation, each supervisory authority should have the power to impose administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate 4.5.2016 L 119/27 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L 351, 20.12.2012, p. 1). infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether and to which extent public authorities should be subject to adminis­trative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this Regulation. (151)  The legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In any event, the fines imposed should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (152)  Where this Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation, Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or adminis­trative, should be determined by Member State law. (153)  Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including journalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency, and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. (154)  This Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the 4.5.2016 L 119/28 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re‑use of public sector information (OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 90). processing of personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular, that Directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. (155)  Member State law or collective agreements, including ‘works agreements’, may provide for specific rules on the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship. (156)  The processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data minimisation. The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects, specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing, to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant legislation such as on clinical trials. (157)  By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services. In order to facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in Union or Member State law. (158)  Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing, bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote, disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public interest. Member States should also be authorised to provide for the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular the Holocaust, or war crimes. 4.5.2016 L 119/29 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (159)  Where personal data are processed for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should take into account the Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If the result of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for further measures in the interest of the data subject, the general rules of this Regulation should apply in view of those measures. (160)  Where personal data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. (161)  For the purpose of consenting to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should apply. (162)  Where personal data are processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing. Union or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine statistical content, control of access, specifications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality. Statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes, including a scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person. (163)  The confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities collect for the production of official European and official national statistics should be protected. European statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU, while national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) provides further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European statistics. (164)  As regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller or processor access to personal data and access to their premises, Member States may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, specific rules in order to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without prejudice to existing Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required by Union law. (165)  This Regulation respects and does not prejudice the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU. (166)  In order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement 4.5.2016 L 119/30 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC (OJ L 158, 27.5.2014, p. 1). (2)Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164). of personal data within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms, information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. (167)  In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context, the Commission should consider specific measures for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. (168)  The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards and mechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats and procedures for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance; and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board. (169)  The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require. (170)  Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (171)  Directive 95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed. (172)  The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (1). (173)  This Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms vis-à- vis the processing of personal data which are not subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), including the obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to clarify the relationship between this Regulation and Directive 2002/58/EC, that Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, Directive 2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with this Regulation, 4.5.2016 L 119/31 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)OJ C 192, 30.6.2012, p. 7. (2)Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37). HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I General provisions Article 1 Subject-matter and objectives 1.This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. 2.This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. 3.The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. Article 2 Material scope 1.This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. 2.This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data: (a)  in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law; (b)  by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU; (c)  by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity; (d)  by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. 3.For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with Article 98. 4.This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive. Article 3 Territorial scope 1.This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not. 4.5.2016 L 119/32 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to: (a)  the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or (b)  the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. 3.This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law. Article 4 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation:  (1) ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;  (2) ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;  (3) ‘restriction of processing’ means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future;  (4) ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;  (5) ‘pseudonymisation’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;  (6) ‘filing system’ means any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis;  (7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;  (8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;  (9) ‘recipient’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the 4.5.2016 L 119/33 Official Journal of the European Union EN     framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing;  (10) ‘third party’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data;  (11) ‘consent’ of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;  (12) ‘personal data breach’ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed;  (13) ‘genetic data’ means personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question; (14)‘biometric data’ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physio­logical or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;  (15) ‘data concerning health’ means personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status;  (16) ‘main establishment’ means: (a)as regards a controller with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central adminis­tration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union and the latter establishment has the power to have such decisions implemented, in which case the establishment having taken such decisions is to be considered to be the main establishment; (b)as regards a processor with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central adminis­tration in the Union, or, if the processor has no central administration in the Union, the establishment of the processor in the Union where the main processing activities in the context of the activities of an establishment of the processor take place to the extent that the processor is subject to specific obligations under this Regulation;  (17) ‘representative’ means a natural or legal person established in the Union who, designated by the controller or processor in writing pursuant to Article 27, represents the controller or processor with regard to their respective obligations under this Regulation;

CHAPTER II Principles Article 5 Principles relating to processing of personal data 1.Personal data shall be: (a)  processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’); (b)  collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’); (c)  adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’); (d)  accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’); 4.5.2016 L 119/35 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1). (e)  kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’); (f)  processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’). 2.The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’). Article 6 Lawfulness of processing 1.Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a)  the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; (b)  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; (c)  processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d)  processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e)  processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f)  processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. 2.Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. 3.The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: (a)  Union law; or (b)  Member State law to which the controller is subject. The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific 4.5.2016 L 119/36 Official Journal of the European Union EN     processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. 4.Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia: (a)  any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; (b)  the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; (c)  the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; (d)  the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; (e)  the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation. Article 7 Conditions for consent 1.Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. 2.If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. 3.The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. 4.When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Article 8 Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services 1.Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. 4.5.2016 L 119/37 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology. 3.Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child. Article 9 Processing of special categories of personal data 1.Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 2.Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: (a)  the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; (b)  processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; (c)  processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; (d)  processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects; (e)  processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject; (f)  processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity; (g)  processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; (h)  processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3; (i)  processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy; 4.5.2016 L 119/38 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (j)  processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or Member State law which shall be propor­tionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject. 3.Personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies. 4.Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. Article 10 Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority. Article 11 Processing which does not require identification 1.If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation. 2.Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification. CHAPTER III Rights of the data subject Section 1 Transparency and modalities Article 12 Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject 1.The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other means. 4.5.2016 L 119/39 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. 3.The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. 4.If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy. 5.Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either: (a)  charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b)  refuse to act on the request. The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. 6.Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. 7.The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable. 8.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons. Section 2 Information and access to personal data Article 13 Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject 1.Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information: (a)  the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative; (b)  the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable; (c)  the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; 4.5.2016 L 119/40 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (d)  where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; (e)  the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any; (f)  where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available. 2.In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: (a)  the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (b)  the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability; (c)  where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; (d)  the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (e)  whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data; (f)  the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. 3.Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2. 4.Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information. Article 14 Information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject 1.Where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information: (a)  the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative; (b)  the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable; (c)  the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; (d)  the categories of personal data concerned; (e)  the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any; 4.5.2016 L 119/41 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (f)where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a recipient in a third country or internat­ional organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available. 2.In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject: (a)  the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (b)  where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; (c)  the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject and to object to processing as well as the right to data portability; (d)  where processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; (e)  the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (f)  from which source the personal data originate, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources; (g)  the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. 3.The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: (a)  within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed; (b)  if the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject; or (c)  if a disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed. 4.Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2. 5.Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as: (a)  the data subject already has the information; (b)  the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available; (c)  obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject's legitimate interests; or (d)  where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy. 4.5.2016 L 119/42 Official Journal of the European Union EN     Article 15 Right of access by the data subject 1.The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information: (a)  the purposes of the processing; (b)  the categories of personal data concerned; (c)  the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; (d)  where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (e)  the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing; (f)  the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (g)  where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; (h)  the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. 2.Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer. 3.The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.

The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it. Article 20 Right to data portability 1.The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where: (a)  the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1); and (b)  the processing is carried out by automated means. 2.In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. 3.The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 4.The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Section 4 Right to object and automated individual decision-making Article 21 Right to object 1.The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 2.Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. 3.Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes. 4.5.2016 L 119/45 Official Journal of the European Union EN     4.At the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information. 5.In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications. 6.Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. Article 22 Automated individual decision-making, including profiling 1.The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. 2.Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision: (a)  is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller; (b)  is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (c)  is based on the data subject's explicit consent. 3.In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision. 4.Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place. Section 5 Restrictions Article 23 Restrictions 1.Union or Member State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 12 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard: (a)  national security; (b)  defence; (c)  public security; 4.5.2016 L 119/46 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (d)  the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security; (e)  other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, including monetary, budgetary and taxation a matters, public health and social security; (f)  the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings; (g)  the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions; (h)  a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a) to (e) and (g); (i)  the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others; (j)  the enforcement of civil law claims. 2.In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to: (a)  the purposes of the processing or categories of processing; (b)  the categories of personal data; (c)  the scope of the restrictions introduced; (d)  the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer; (e)  the specification of the controller or categories of controllers; (f)  the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of processing; (g)  the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; and (h)  the right of data subjects to be informed about the restriction, unless that may be prejudicial to the purpose of the restriction. CHAPTER IV Controller and processor Section 1 General obligations Article 24 Responsibility of the controller 1.Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary. 2.Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller. 3.Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/47 Official Journal of the European Union EN     Article 25 Data protection by design and by default 1.Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects. 2.The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons. 3.An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Article 26 Joint controllers 1.Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects. 2.The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject. 3.Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers. Article 27 Representatives of controllers or processors not established in the Union 1.Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union. 2.The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to: (a)  processing which is occasional, does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing; or (b)  a public authority or body. 4.5.2016 L 119/48 Official Journal of the European Union EN     3.The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are. 4.The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 5.The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. Article 28 Processor 1.Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. 2.The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. 3.Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: (a)  processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest; (b)  ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; (c)  takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32; (d)  respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor; (e)  taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III; (f)  assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor; (g)  at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data; (h)  makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/49 Official Journal of the European Union EN     With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. 4.Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations. 5.Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article. 6.Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43. 7.The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). 8.A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 9.The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 10.Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing. Article 29 Processing under the authority of the controller or processor The processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law. Article 30 Records of processing activities 1.Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information: (a)the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representa­tive and the data protection officer; (b)  the purposes of the processing; (c)  a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data; 4.5.2016 L 119/50 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (d)  the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations; (e)where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identifi­cation of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards; (f)  where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data; (g)  where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1). 2.Each processor and, where applicable, the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing: (a)  the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer; (b)  the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller; (c)where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identifi­cation of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards; (d)  where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1). 3.The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 4.The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request. 5.The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. Article 31 Cooperation with the supervisory authority The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks. Section 2 Security of personal data Article 32 Security of processing 1.Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: (a)  the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; 4.5.2016 L 119/51 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (b)  the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; (c)  the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; (d)  a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. 2.In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. 3.Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. 4.The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. Article 33 Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority 1.In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. 2.The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. 3.The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: (a)  describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned; (b)  communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; (c)  describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; (d)  describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. 4.Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. 5.The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article. Article 34 Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject 1.When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 4.5.2016 L 119/52 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3). 3.The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met: (a)  the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption; (b)  the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; (c)  it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. 4.If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Section 3 Data protection impact assessment and prior consultation Article 35 Data protection impact assessment 1.Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. 2.The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment. 3.A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of: (a)  a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; (b)  processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or (c)  a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. 4.The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68. 5.The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. 6.Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. 4.5.2016 L 119/53 Official Journal of the European Union EN     7.The assessment shall contain at least: (a)  a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; (b)  an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; (c)  an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and (d)  the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. 8.Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. 9.Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. 10.Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. 11.Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations. Article 36 Prior consultation 1.The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk. 2.Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation. 3.When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with: (a)  where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings; (b)  the purposes and means of the intended processing; (c)  the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation; (d)  where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer; 4.5.2016 L 119/54 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (e)  the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35; and (f)  any other information requested by the supervisory authority. 4.Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing. 5.Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior author­isation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. Section 4 Data protection officer Article 37 Designation of the data protection officer 1.The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where: (a)  the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their judicial capacity; (b)  the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or (c)  the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. 2.A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment. 3.Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size. 4.In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing controllers or processors. 5.The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39. 6.The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract. 7.The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority. Article 38 Position of the data protection officer 1.The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. 4.5.2016 L 119/55 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge. 3.The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor. 4.Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation. 5.The data protection officer shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law. 6.The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. Article 39 Tasks of the data protection officer 1.The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks: (a)  to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions; (b)  to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits; (c)  to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35; (d)  to cooperate with the supervisory authority; (e)  to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter. 2.The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. Section 5 Codes of conduct and certification Article 40 Codes of conduct 1.The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. 2.Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to: (a)  fair and transparent processing; 4.5.2016 L 119/56 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (b)  the legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts; (c)  the collection of personal data; (d)  the pseudonymisation of personal data; (e)  the information provided to the public and to data subjects; (f)  the exercise of the rights of data subjects; (g)  the information provided to, and the protection of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental responsibility over children is to be obtained; (h)  the measures and procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 25 and the measures to ensure security of processing referred to in Article 32; (i)  the notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities and the communication of such personal data breaches to data subjects; (j)  the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations; or (k)  out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between controllers and data subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 and 79. 3.In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to the rights of data subjects. 4.A code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 5.Associations and other bodies referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The supervisory authority shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation and shall approve that draft code, amendment or extension if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards. 6.Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register and publish the code. 7.Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards. 8.Where the opinion referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the Commission. 9.The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide that the approved code of conduct, amendment or extension submitted to it pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article have general validity within the Union. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2). 4.5.2016 L 119/57 Official Journal of the European Union EN     10.The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in accordance with paragraph 9. 11.The Board shall collate all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly available by way of appropriate means. Article 41 Monitoring of approved codes of conduct 1.Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried out by a body which has an appropriate level of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code and is accredited for that purpose by the competent supervisory authority. 2.A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor compliance with a code of conduct where that body has: (a)  demonstrated its independence and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority; (b)  established procedures which allow it to assess the eligibility of controllers and processors concerned to apply the code, to monitor their compliance with its provisions and to periodically review its operation; (c)  established procedures and structures to handle complaints about infringements of the code or the manner in which the code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or processor, and to make those procedures and structures transparent to data subjects and the public; and (d)  demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority that its tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. 3.The competent supervisory authority shall submit the draft criteria for accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 4.Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority and the provisions of Chapter VIII, a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringement of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such actions and the reasons for taking them. 5.The competent supervisory authority shall revoke the accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 if the conditions for accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken by the body infringe this Regulation. 6.This Article shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities and bodies. Article 42 Certification 1.The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken into account. 4.5.2016 L 119/58 Official Journal of the European Union EN     2.In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects. 3.The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent. 4.A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 5.A certification pursuant to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board, this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal. 6.The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification mechanism shall provide the certifi­cation body referred to in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification procedure. 7.Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions, provided that the relevant requirements continue to be met. Certification shall be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the requirements for the certification are not or are no longer met. 8.The Board shall collate all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means. Article 43 Certification bodies 1.Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, certification bodies which have an appropriate level of expertise in relation to data protection shall, after informing the supervisory authority in order to allow it to exercise its powers pursuant to point (h) of Article 58(2) where necessary, issue and renew certification. Member States shall ensure that those certification bodies are accredited by one or both of the following: (a)  the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56; (b)  the national accreditation body named in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) in accordance with EN-ISO/IEC 17065/2012 and with the additional requirements established by the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 2.Certification bodies referred to in paragraph 1 shall be accredited in accordance with that paragraph only where they have: (a)  demonstrated their independence and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the certification to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority; 4.5.2016 L 119/59 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (1)Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accredi­tation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30). (b)  undertaken to respect the criteria referred to in Article 42(5) and approved by the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56 or by the Board pursuant to Article 63; (c)  established procedures for the issuing, periodic review and withdrawal of data protection certification, seals and marks; (d)  established procedures and structures to handle complaints about infringements of the certification or the manner in which the certification has been, or is being, implemented by the controller or processor, and to make those procedures and structures transparent to data subjects and the public; and (e)  demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority, that their tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. 3.The accreditation of certification bodies as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall take place on the basis of criteria approved by the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56 or by the Board pursuant to Article 63. In the case of accreditation pursuant to point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article, those requirements shall complement those envisaged in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and the technical rules that describe the methods and procedures of the certification bodies. 4.The certification bodies referred to in paragraph 1 shall be responsible for the proper assessment leading to the certification or the withdrawal of such certification without prejudice to the responsibility of the controller or processor for compliance with this Regulation. The accreditation shall be issued for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed on the same conditions provided that the certification body meets the requirements set out in this Article. 5.The certification bodies referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide the competent supervisory authorities with the reasons for granting or withdrawing the requested certification. 6.The requirements referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article and the criteria referred to in Article 42(5) shall be made public by the supervisory authority in an easily accessible form. The supervisory authorities shall also transmit those requirements and criteria to the Board. The Board shall collate all certification mechanisms and data protection seals in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means. 7.Without prejudice to Chapter VIII, the competent supervisory authority or the national accreditation body shall revoke an accreditation of a certification body pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article where the conditions for the accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken by a certification body infringe this Regulation. 8.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of specifying the requirements to be taken into account for the data protection certification mechanisms referred to in Article 42(1). 9.The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down technical standards for certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks, and mechanisms to promote and recognise those certification mechanisms, seals and marks. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). CHAPTER V Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations Article 44 General principle for transfers Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another internat­ional organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined. 4.5.2016 L 119/60 Official Journal of the European Union EN     Article 45 Transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision 1.A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific authorisation. 2.When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements: (a)  the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third country or international organisation which are complied with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred; (b)  the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory authorities of the Member States; and (c)  the international commitments the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into, or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data. 3.The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). 4.The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor developments in third countries and international organ­isations that could affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC. 5.The Commission shall, where available information reveals, in particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent necessary, repeal, amend or suspend the decision referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article by means of implementing acts without retro-active effect. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 93(3). 6.The Commission shall enter into consultations with the third country or international organisation with a view to remedying the situation giving rise to the decision made pursuant to paragraph 5. 7.A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is without prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question pursuant to Articles 46 to 49. 8.The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union and on its website a list of the third countries, territories and specified sectors within a third country and international organisations for which it has decided that an adequate level of protection is or is no longer ensured. 4.5.2016 L 119/61 Official Journal of the European Union EN     9.Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article. Article 46 Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards 1.In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. 2.The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without requiring any specific authoris­ation from a supervisory authority, by: (a)  a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies; (b)  binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47; (c)  standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2); (d)  standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission pursuant to the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2); (e)  an approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights; or (f)  an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights. 3.Subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, the appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be provided for, in particular, by: (a)  contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the controller, processor or the recipient of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; or (b)  provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies which include enforceable and effective data subject rights. 4.The supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. 5.Authorisations by a Member State or supervisory authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by that supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Article 47 Binding corporate rules 1.The competent supervisory authority shall approve binding corporate rules in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63, provided that they: (a)  are legally binding and apply to and are enforced by every member concerned of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, including their employees; 4.5.2016 L 119/62 Official Journal of the European Union EN     (b)  expressly confer enforceable rights on data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data; and (c)  fulfil the requirements laid down in paragraph 2. 2.The binding corporate rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall specify at least: (a)  the structure and contact details of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and of each of its members; (b)  the data transfers or set of transfers, including the categories of personal data, the type of processing and its purposes, the type of data subjects affected and the identification of the third country or countries in question; (c)  their legally binding nature, both internally and externally; (d)  the application of the general data protection principles, in particular purpose limitation, data minimisation, limited storage periods, data quality, data protection by design and by default, legal basis for processing, processing of special categories of personal data, measures to ensure data security, and the requirements in respect of onward transfers to bodies not bound by the binding corporate rules; (e)  the rights of data subjects in regard to processing and the means to exercise those rights, including the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling in accordance with Article 22, the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and before the competent courts of the Member States in accordance with Article 79, and to obtain redress and, where appropriate, compensation for a breach of the binding corporate rules; (f)  the acceptance by the controller or processor established on the territory of a Member State of liability for any breaches of the binding corporate rules by any member concerned not established in the Union; the controller or the processor shall be exempt from that liability, in whole or in part, only if it proves that that member is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage; (g)  how the information on the binding corporate rules, in particular on the provisions referred to in points (d), (e) and (f) of this paragraph is provided to the data subjects in addition to Articles 13 and 14; (h)  the tasks of any data protection officer designated in accordance with Article 37 or any other person or entity in charge of the monitoring compliance with the binding corporate rules within the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, as well as monitoring training and complaint-handling; (i)  the complaint procedures; (j)  the mechanisms within the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity for ensuring the verification of compliance with the binding corporate rules. Such mechanisms shall include data protection audits and methods for ensuring corrective actions to protect the rights of the data subject. Results of such verification should be communicated to the person or entity referred to in point (h) and to the board of the controlling undertaking of a group of undertakings, or of the group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and should be available upon request to the competent supervisory authority; (k)  the mechanisms for reporting and recording changes to the rules and reporting those changes to the supervisory authority; (l)  the cooperation mechanism with the supervisory authority to ensure compliance by any member of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, in particular by making available to the supervisory authority the results of verifications of the measures referred to in point (j); (m)  the mechanisms for reporting to the competent supervisory authority any legal requirements to which a member of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity is subject in a third country which are likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided by the binding corporate rules; and (n)  the appropriate data protection training to personnel having permanent or regular access to personal data. 4.5.2016 L 119/63 Official Journal of the European Union EN     3.The Commission may specify the format and procedures for the exchange of information between controllers, processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules within the meaning of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2). Article 48 Transfers or disclosures not authorised by Union law Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer pursuant to this Chapter. Article 49 Derogations for specific situations 1.In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an in­ternational organisation shall take place only on one of the following conditions: (a)  the data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards; (b)  the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request; (c)  the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person; (d)  the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest; (e)  the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; (f)  the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; (g)  the transfer is made from a register which according to Union or Member State law is intended to provide information to the public and which is open to consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to the extent that the conditions laid down by Union or Member State law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case. Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, inform the data subject of the transfer and on the compelling legitimate interests pursued. 2.A transfer pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the personal data contained in the register. Where the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer shall be made only at the request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients. 4.5.2016 L 119/64 Official Journal of the European Union EN     3.Points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and the second subparagraph thereof shall not apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers. 4.The public interest referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be recognised in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject. 5.In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of personal data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States shall notify such provisions to the Commission. 6.The controller or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30. Article 50 International cooperation for the protection of personal data In relation to third countries and international organisations, the Commission and supervisory authorities shall take appropriate steps to: (a)  develop international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate the effective enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data; (b)  provide international mutual assistance in the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data, including through notification, complaint referral, investigative assistance and information exchange, subject to appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data and other fundamental rights and freedoms; (c)  engage relevant stakeholders in discussion and activities aimed at furthering international cooperation in the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data; (d)promote the exchange and documentation of personal data protection legislation and practice, including on jurisdic­tional conflicts with third countries.

Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. IEEE Standards documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards through a consensus development process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the Institute and serve without compensation. While the IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process, the IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information contained in its standards. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of ISO/IEC JTC 1 is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of this standard may require the use of subject matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no position is taken with respect to the existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. ISO/IEEE is not responsible for identifying essential patents or patent claims for which a license may be required, for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of patents or patent claims or determining whether any licensing terms or conditions provided in connection with submission of a Letter of Assurance or a Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration Form, if any, or in any licensing agreements are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Users of this standard are expressly advised that determination of the validity of any patent rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely their own responsibility. Further information may be obtained from ISO or the IEEE Standards Association. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 7, Software and systems engineering, in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Systems and Software Engineering Standards Committee, under the Partner Standards Development Organization cooperation agreement between ISO and IEEE. This first edition of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 cancels and replaces the ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (second edition), which has been technically revised. Changes in this revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 were developed in conjunction with a corresponding revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, Systems and software engineering – Software life cycle processes.  The purpose of these revisions is to accomplish the harmonization of the structures and contents of the two International Standards, while supporting the requirements of the assessment community.   This International Standard was developed with the following goals:  provide a common terminology between the revision of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,  where applicable, provide common process names and process structure between the revision of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,  enable the user community to evolve towards fully harmonized standards, while maximizing backward compatibility. This revision is intended to achieve a fully harmonized view of the system and software life cycle processes.

This has led to new opportunities, but also to increased challenges for the organizations that create and utilize systems.  These challenges exist throughout the life cycle of a system and at all levels of architectural detail.  This International Standard provides a common process framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans, adopting a Systems Engineering approach. Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining stakeholder needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem. It integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. It considers both the business and the technical needs of all stakeholders with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the needs of users and other applicable stakeholders. This life cycle spans the conception of ideas through to the retirement of a system.  It provides the processes for acquiring and supplying systems. It helps to improve communication and cooperation among the parties that create, utilize and manage modern systems in order that they can work in an integrated, coherent fashion.  In addition, this framework provides for the assessment and improvement of the life cycle processes. The processes in this International Standard form a comprehensive set from which an organization can construct system life cycle models appropriate to its products and services.  An organization, depending on its purpose, can select and apply an appropriate subset to fulfill that purpose. This International Standard can be used in one or more of the following modes:  By an organization — to help establish an environment of desired processes.  These processes can be supported by an infrastructure of methods, procedures, techniques, tools and trained personnel.  The organization may then employ this environment to perform and manage its projects and progress systems through their life cycle stages.  In this mode this International Standard is used to assess conformance of a declared, established environment to its provisions.  By a project — to help select, structure and employ the elements of an established environment to provide products and services.  In this mode this International Standard is used in the assessment of conformance of the project to the declared and established environment.  By an acquirer and a supplier — to help develop an agreement concerning processes and activities.  Via the agreement, the processes and activities in this International Standard are selected, negotiated, agreed to and performed.  In this mode this International Standard is used for guidance in developing the agreement.  By process assessors — to serve as a process reference model for use in the performance of process assessments that may be used to support organizational process improvement.

This standard replaces ISO/IEC/IEEE Std 15288™-2008, Systems and software engineering—System life cycle processes.  That standard replaced IEEE Std 15288™-2004, Adoption of ISO/IEC 15288:2002, Systems and software engineering—System life cycle processes. The original ISO/IEC 15288 was published in November 2002 and was the first international standard to provide a comprehensive set of life cycle processes for systems.    This new revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 is the product of a coordinated effort by IEEE and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7. The base document for the revision is the ISO/IEC/IEEE standard. Development of this revision was carefully coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2015 to align structure, terms, and corresponding organizational and project processes.  This revised standard is a step in the SC7 harmonization strategy to achieve a fully integrated suite of system and software life cycle processes and guidance for their application. It is also an important step in the shared strategy of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 and the IEEE to harmonize their respective collections of standards.

It defines a set of processes and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint.  These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system’s structure.  Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.  This is accomplished through the involvement of all stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. This International Standard also provides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the system life cycle processes used within an organization or a project.  Organizations and projects can use these processes when acquiring and supplying systems. This International Standard concerns those systems that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following system elements: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities. When a system element is software, the software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2015 may be used to implement that system element.  The two standards are harmonized for concurrent use on a single project or in a single organization.  1.2 Purpose  The purpose of this International Standard is to provide a defined set of processes to facilitate communication among acquirers, suppliers and other stakeholders in the life cycle of a system. This International Standard applies to organizations in their roles as both acquirers and suppliers.  It can be used by a single organization in a self-imposed mode or in a multi-party situation.  Parties can be from the same organization or from different organizations and the situation can range from an informal agreement to a formal contract. The processes in this International Standard can be used as a basis for establishing business environments, e.g., methods, procedures, techniques, tools and trained personnel. Annex A provides normative direction regarding the tailoring of these system life cycle processes. 1.3 Field of application This International Standard applies to the full life cycle of systems, including conception, development, production, utilization, support and retirement of systems, and to the acquisition and supply of systems, whether performed internally or externally to an organization.  The life cycle processes of this International Standard can be applied concurrently, iteratively and recursively to a system and incrementally to its elements.  There is a wide variety of systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application, complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans and evolution.  This International Standard describes the processes that comprise the life cycle of man-made systems. It therefore applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass-produced systems and customized, adaptable systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone system and to systems that are embedded and integrated into larger more complex and complete systems. This International Standard provides a process reference model characterized in terms of the process purpose and the process outcomes that result from the successful execution of the activity tasks. Annex B lists examples of artifacts and information items that may be associated with various processes. This International Standard can therefore be used as a reference model to support process assessment as specified in ISO/IEC Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  2  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved 15504-2:2003. Annex C provides information regarding the use of the system life cycle processes as a process reference model. Annex D describes the process constructs for use in the process reference model. 1.4 Limitations This International Standard does not prescribe a specific system life cycle model, development methodology, method, model or technique. The users of this International Standard are responsible for selecting a life cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities, and tasks in this International Standard into that model. The parties are also responsible for selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques suitable for the project.  Although this International Standard does not establish a management system, it is intended to be compatible with the quality management system provided by ISO 9001, the service management system provided by ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013), and the information security management system provided by ISO/IEC 27000. This International Standard does not detail information items in terms of name, format, explicit content and recording media. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 addresses the content for life cycle process information items (documentation). 2 Conformance 2.1 Intended usage The requirements in this International Standard are contained in Clause 6 and Annex A.  This International Standard provides requirements for a number of processes suitable for usage during the life cycle of a system or product. It is recognized that particular projects or organizations may not need to use all of the processes provided by this International Standard. Therefore, implementation of this International Standard typically involves selecting and declaring a set of processes suitable to the organization or project.  There are two ways that an implementation can be claimed to conform to the provisions of this International Standard – full conformance and tailored conformance.  There are two criteria for claiming full conformance. Achieving either criterion suffices for conformance, although the chosen criterion (or criteria) is to be stated in the claim. Claiming “full conformance to tasks” asserts that all of the requirements of the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes are achieved. Alternatively, claiming “full conformance to outcomes” asserts that all of the required outcomes of the declared set of processes are achieved. Full conformance to outcomes permits greater freedom in the implementation of conforming processes and may be useful for implementing processes to be used in the context of an innovative life cycle model. NOTE 1 Options for conformance are provided for needed flexibility in the application of this International Standard. Each process has a set of objectives (phrased as “outcomes”) and a set of activities and tasks that represent one way to achieve the objectives. NOTE 2 Users who implement the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes can assert full conformance to tasks of the selected processes. Some users, however, might have innovative process variants that achieve the objectives (i.e., the outcomes) of the declared set of processes without implementing all of the activities and tasks. These users can assert full conformance to the outcomes of the declared set of processes. The two criteria—conformance to task and conformance to outcome—are necessarily not equivalent since specific performance of activities and tasks may require, in some cases, a higher level of capability than just the achievement of outcomes. NOTE 3 When this International Standard is used to help develop an agreement between an acquirer and a supplier, clauses of this International Standard can be selected for incorporation in the agreement with or without modification.  In this case, it is more appropriate for the acquirer and supplier to claim compliance with the agreement than conformance with this International Standard. NOTE 4 An organization (for example, national, industrial association, company) imposing this International Standard as a condition of trade can specify and make public the minimum set of required processes, outcomes, activities, and tasks, which constitute suppliers' compliance with the conditions of trade. NOTE 5 Requirements of this International Standard are marked by the use of the verb ""shall"". Recommendations are marked by the use of the verb ""should"". Permissions are marked by the use of the verb ""may"". However, despite the verb that is used, the requirements for conformance are selected as described previously.

Full conformance to outcomes is achieved by demonstrating that all of the outcomes of the declared set of processes have been achieved. In this situation, the provisions for activities and tasks of the declared set of processes are guidance rather than requirements, regardless of the verb form that is used in the provision. NOTE One intended use of this International Standard is to facilitate process assessment and improvement. For this purpose, the objectives of each process are written in the form of 'outcomes' compatible with the provisions of ISO/IEC 15504-2 and ISO/IEC 33002. Those standards provide for the assessment of the processes of this International Standard, providing a basis for improvement. Users intending process assessment and improvement may use the process outcomes written in this International Standard as the ""process reference model"" required by ISO/IEC 15504-2 and ISO/IEC 33002.  2.2.2 Full conformance to tasks A claim of full conformance declares the set of processes for which conformance is claimed. Full conformance to tasks is achieved by demonstrating that all of the requirements of the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes have been achieved. In this situation, the provisions for the outcomes of the declared set of processes are guidance rather than requirements, regardless of the verb form that is used in the provision. NOTE A claim of full conformance to tasks may be appropriate in contractual situations where an acquirer or a regulator requires detailed understanding of the suppliers‘ processes. 2.3 Tailored conformance When this International Standard is used as a basis for establishing a set of processes that do not qualify for full conformance, the clauses of this International Standard are selected or modified in accordance with the tailoring process prescribed in Annex A.  The tailored text, for which tailored conformance is claimed, is declared.  Tailored conformance is achieved by demonstrating that the outcomes, activities, and tasks, as tailored, have been achieved. 3 Normative references None. 4 Terms, definitions, and abbreviated terms 4.1 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) and 24748-2 (IEEE Std 24748-2-2012) guides on the application of life cycle management. 5.2 System concepts 5.2.1 Systems The systems considered in this International Standard are man-made, created and utilized to provide products or services in defined environments for the benefit of users and other stakeholders.  These systems may be configured with one or more of the following system elements: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities .  As viewed by the user, they are thought of as products or services. The perception and definition of a particular system, its architecture and its system elements depend on a stakeholder's interests and responsibilities.  One stakeholder's system-of-interest can be viewed as a system element in another stakeholder's system-of-interest.  Furthermore, a system-of-interest can be viewed as being part of the environment for another stakeholder's system-of-interest. The following are key points regarding the characteristics of the systems-of-interest: a) defined boundaries encapsulate meaningful needs and practical solutions; b) there is a hierarchical or other relationship between system elements; c) an entity at any level in the system-of-interest can be viewed as a system; d) a system comprises an integrated, defined set of subordinate system elements; e) humans can be viewed as both users external to a system and as system elements (i.e., operators) within a system; f) a system can be viewed in isolation as an entity, i.e., a product; or as a collection of functions capable of interacting with its surrounding environment, i.e., a set of services. Whatever the boundaries chosen to define the system, the concepts in this International Standard are generic and permit a practitioner to correlate or adapt individual instances of life cycles to its system principles. 5.2.2 System structure The system life cycle processes in this International Standard are described in relation to a system (see Figure 1) that is composed of a set of interacting system elements, each of which can be implemented to fulfill its respective specified requirements.  Responsibility for the implementation of any system element may therefore be delegated to another party through an agreement.

For more complex systems-of-interest, a prospective system element may itself need to be considered as a system (that in turn is comprised of system elements) before a complete set of system elements can be defined with confidence (see Figure 2).  In this manner, the appropriate system life cycle processes are applied recursively to a system-of-interest to resolve its structure to the point where understandable and manageable system elements can be implemented (made, bought, or reused).  While Figures 1 and 2 imply a hierarchical relationship, in reality there are an increasing number of systems that, from one or more aspects, are not hierarchical, such as networks and other distributed systems. Annex G discusses the concept of a system of systems (SoS).  Figure 2 — System-of-interest structure 5.2.3 Enabling systems Throughout the life cycle of a system-of-interest, essential services are required from systems that are not directly a part of the operational environment of the system-of interest, e.g., mass-production system, training system, maintenance system.  Each of these systems enables a part, e.g., a stage of the life cycle of the system-of-interest to be conducted.  Termed ""enabling systems"", they facilitate progression of the system-of-interest through its life cycle. The relationship between the services delivered to the operational environment by the system-of-interest and the services delivered by the enabling systems to the system-of-interest are shown in Figure 3.  Enabling systems can be seen to contribute indirectly to the services provided by the system-of-interest.  The interrelationships between the system-of-interest and the enabling systems can be bi-directional or a one-way relationship.  In addition to interacting with enabling systems, the system-of-interest may also interact with other systems in the operating environment, shown as Systems A, B, and C.  Requirements for interfaces with enabling systems and other systems in the operational environment will need to be included in the requirements for the system-of-interest.

Since they are interdependent, they can also be viewed as a system.  When a suitable enabling system does not already exist, the project that is responsible for the system-of-interest can also be directly responsible for creating and using the enabling system. Creating the enabling systems can be viewed as a separate project and subsequently another system-of-interest. Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes. 5.3 Organization and project concepts 5.3.1 Organizations When an organization, as a whole or a part, enters into an agreement, it is sometimes called a “party” to the agreement. Parties may be from the same organization or from separate organizations. An organization may be as small as a single individual, if the individual is assigned responsibilities and authorities. In informal terms, the organization that is responsible for executing a process is sometimes referred to by the name of that process. For example, the organization executing the Acquisition process is sometimes called the “acquirer”. Other examples include supplier, implementer, maintainer, and operator. A few other terms are applied to organizations in this standard: ""user"" can be the organization that benefits from the utilization of the product or service; ""customer"" refers to the user and acquirer collectively; and ""stakeholder"" refers to an individual or organization with an interest in the system. The processes and organizations are only related functionally.  The standard does not dictate or imply a structure for an organization, nor does it specify that particular processes are to be executed by particular parts of the organization. It is the responsibility of the organization that implements the standard to define a suitable structure for the organization and assign appropriate roles for the execution of processes. The processes in this standard form a comprehensive set to serve various organizations. An organization, small or large, depending on its business purpose or its acquisition strategy, can select an appropriate set of the processes (and associated activities and tasks) to fulfill that purpose. An organization may perform one process or more than one process.  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  13 Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  14  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved This standard is intended to be applied by an organization internally or externally by two or more organizations. When applied internally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of an agreement that may vary in formality under different circumstances. When applied externally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of a contract. This standard uses the term “agreement” to apply to either situation. For the purpose of this standard, any project is assumed to be conducted within the context of an organization. This is important because a project is dependent upon various outcomes produced by the business processes of the organization, e.g., employees to staff the project and facilities to house the project. For this purpose, this standard provides a set of “Organizational Project-Enabling” processes. These processes are not assumed to be adequate to operate a business; instead the processes, considered as a collection, are intended to state the minimum set of dependencies that the project places upon the organization. 5.3.2 Organization and project-level adoption Modern businesses strive to develop a robust set of life cycle processes that are applied repeatedly to the projects of the business. Therefore, this standard is intended to be useful for adoption at either the organization level or at the project level. An organization would adopt the standard and supplement it with appropriate procedures, practices, tools and policies. A project of the organization would typically conform to the organization's processes rather than conform directly to this standard. In some cases, projects may be executed by an organization that does not have an appropriate set of processes adopted at the organizational level. Such a project may apply the provisions of this standard directly to the project. 5.4 Life cycle concepts 5.4.1 System life cycle model Every system has a life cycle.  A life cycle can be described using an abstract functional model that represents the conceptualization of a need for the system, its realization, utilization, evolution and disposal. A system progresses through its life cycle as the result of actions, performed and managed by people in organizations, using processes for execution of these actions. The detail in the life cycle model is expressed in terms of these processes, their outcomes, relationships and sequence.  This International Standard does not prescribe any particular life cycle model. Instead it defines a set of processes, termed life cycle processes, that can be used in the definition of the system's life cycle. Also, this International Standard does not prescribe any particular sequence of processes within the life cycle model. The sequence of the processes is determined by project objectives and by selection of the system life cycle model. 5.4.2 System life cycle stages Life cycles vary according to the nature, purpose, use and prevailing circumstances of the system. Each stage has a distinct purpose and contribution to the whole life cycle and is considered when planning and executing the system life cycle. The stages represent the major life cycle periods associated with a system and they relate to the state of the system description or the system itself. The stages describe the major progress and achievement milestones of the system through its life cycle.  They give rise to the primary decision gates of the life cycle. These decision gates are used by organizations to understand and manage the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with costs, schedule and functionality when creating or utilizing a system. The stages thus provide organizations with a framework within which organization management has high-level visibility and control of project and technical processes. Per ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011), the typical system life cycle stages include concept, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement. Organizations employ stages differently to satisfy contrasting business and risk mitigation strategies.  Using stages concurrently and in different orders can lead to life cycle forms with distinctly different characteristics.   Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle management.

Additional detail regarding this form of process description can be found in ISO/IEC TR 24774. 5.5.3 General characteristics of processes In addition to the basic attributes described in the previous subclause, processes may be characterized by other attributes common to all processes. ISO/IEC 15504-2 identifies common process attributes that characterize six levels of achievement within a measurement framework for process capability. Annex C of this International Standard includes the list of process attributes that contribute to the achievement of higher levels of process capability as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 5.5.4 Tailoring Annex A, which is normative, defines the basic activities needed to perform tailoring of this International Standard. Note that tailoring may diminish the perceived value of a claim of conformance to this standard. This is because it is difficult for other organizations to understand the extent to which tailoring may have deleted desirable provisions. An organization asserting a single-party claim of conformance to this standard may find it advantageous to claim full conformance to a smaller list of processes rather than tailored conformance to a larger list of processes. 5.6 Processes in this standard 5.6.1 Introduction This International Standard groups the activities that can be performed during the life cycle of a system into four process groups. Each of the life cycle processes within those groups is described in terms of its purpose and desired outcomes and lists activities and tasks to be performed to achieve those outcomes. The four process groups and the processes included in each group are depicted in Figure 4. The processes described in this International Standard are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that organizations find useful. A description of each process group is provided in the four subclauses that follow.

One organization (acting as an acquirer) can task another (acting as a supplier) for products or services.  This is achieved using agreements. Generally, organizations act simultaneously or successively as both acquirers and suppliers of systems. The Agreement Processes can be used with less formality when the acquirer and the supplier are in the same organization.  Similarly, they can be used within the organization to agree on the respective responsibilities of organization, project and technical functions.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. 5.6.3 Organizational project-enabling processes The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are concerned with providing the resources needed to enable the project to meet the needs and expectations of the organization’s interested parties.  The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are typically concerned at a strategic level with the management and improvement of the organization’s business or undertaking, with the provision and deployment of resources and assets, and with its management of risks in competitive or uncertain situations.   The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes establish the environment in which projects are conducted. The organization establishes the processes and life cycle models to be used by projects; establishes, redirects, or cancels projects; provides resources required, including human and financial; and sets and monitors the quality measures for systems and other deliverables that are developed by projects for internal and external customers.  The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes create a strong business image for many organizations and imply commercial and profit-making motives.  Nevertheless, the Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are equally relevant to non-profit organizations, since they are also accountable to stakeholders, are responsible for resources and encounter risk in their undertakings.  This International Standard can be applied to non-profit organizations as well as to profit-making organizations.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. 5.6.4 Technical management processes The Technical Management Processes are concerned with managing the resources and assets allocated by organization management and with applying them to fulfill the agreements into which the organization or organizations enter. The Technical Management Processes relate to the technical effort of projects, in particular to planning in terms of cost, timescales and achievements, to the checking of actions to help ensure that they comply with plans and performance criteria, and to the identification and selection of corrective actions that recover shortfalls in progress and achievement. They are used to establish and perform technical plans for the project, manage information across the technical team, assess technical progress against the plans for the system products or services, control technical tasks through to completion, and to aid in the decision-making process. NOTE 1 Technical management is ‘the application of technical and administrative resources to plan, organize and control engineering functions’ (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010). Typically several projects will co-exist in any one organization. The Technical Management Processes can be employed at a corporate level to meet internal needs.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. NOTE 2 Technical Management Processes are applied during the performance of each Technical Process. 5.6.5 Technical processes The Technical Processes are concerned with technical actions throughout the life cycle.  Technical Processes transform the needs of stakeholders into a product and service. By applying that product or operating that service, technical processes provide sustainable performance, when and where needed, in order to meet the stakeholder requirements and achieve customer satisfaction.  The Technical Processes are applied in order to create and use a system, whether it is in the form of a model or is a finished product. The Technical Processes apply at any level in a hierarchy of system structure and at any stage in the life cycle.   Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group.

They can be applied at any level in a system’s hierarchy and at any stage in the life cycle. The functions these processes perform are defined in terms of specific purposes, outcomes and the set of activities and tasks that constitute the process. Each life cycle process in Figure 4 can be invoked, as required, at any time throughout the life cycle. The order that the processes are presented in this standard does not imply any prescriptive order in their use. However, sequential relationships are introduced by the definition of a life cycle model. The detailed purpose and timing of use of these processes throughout the life cycle are influenced by multiple factors, including social, trading, organizational and technical considerations, each of which can vary during the life of a system.  An individual system life cycle is thus a complex system of processes that will normally possess concurrent, iterative, recursive and time dependent characteristics. Concurrent use of processes can exist within a project (e.g., when design actions and preparatory actions for building a system are performed at the same time), and between projects (e.g., when system elements are designed at the same time under different project responsibilities). When the application of the same process or set of processes is repeated on the same system, the application is referred to as iterative. The iterative use of processes is important for the progressive refinement of process outputs, e.g., the interaction between successive verification actions and integration actions can incrementally build confidence in the conformance of the product. Iteration is not only appropriate but also expected. New information is created by the application of a process or set of processes. Typically this information takes the form of questions with respect to requirements, analyzed risks or opportunities. Such questions should be resolved before completing the activities of a process or set of processes. The recursive use of processes, i.e., the repeated application of the same process or set of processes applied to successive levels of system elements in a system’s structure, is a key aspect of the application of this International Standard.  The outputs of processes at any level, whether information, artifacts or services, are inputs to the processes used at the level below (e.g., during top down design) or level above (e.g., during system realization). The outcomes from one application are used as inputs to the next lower (or higher) system in the system structure to arrive at a more detailed or mature set of outcomes. Such an approach adds value to successive systems in the system structure. The changing nature of the influences on the system (e.g., operational environment changes, new opportunities for system element implementation, modified structure and responsibilities in organizations) requires continual review of the selection and timing of process use.  Process use in the life cycle can be dynamic, responding to the many external influences on the system. The life cycle approach also allows for incorporating the changes in the next stage. The life cycle stages assist the planning, execution and management of life cycle processes in the face of this complexity in life cycles by providing comprehensible and recognizable high-level purpose and structure. The set of processes within a life cycle stage are applied with the common goal of satisfying the exit criteria for that stage or the entry criteria of the formal progress reviews within that stage.  The discussion in this section on iterative and recursive use of the system life cycle processes is not meant to imply any specific hierarchical, vertical, or horizontal structure for the system-of-interest, enabling system, organization, or project.  Where justified by product quality risks, detailed descriptions of process instances in the context of the specific product may also be created.  Instantiation of processes involves identifying specific success criteria for a process instance, derived from the product requirements, and identifying the specific activities and tasks needed to achieve the success criteria, derived from the activities and tasks identified in this standard. Creating detailed descriptions of process instances enables better management of product quality risks by establishing the link between the process and the specific product requirements. Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes.

The PRM is applicable to an organization that is assessing its processes in order to determine the capability of these processes. The purpose and outcomes are a statement of the goals of the performance of each process. This statement of goals permits assessment of the effectiveness of the processes in ways other than simple conformity assessment. NOTE In this International Standard, the term “Process Reference Model” is used with the same meaning as ISO/IEC 15504-2. 6 System life cycle processes 6.1 Agreement processes This subclause specifies the requirements for the establishment of agreements with organizational entities external and internal to the organization. The Agreement Processes consist of the following: a) Acquisition process – used by organizations for acquiring products or services; b) Supply process – used by organizations for supplying products or services. These processes define the activities necessary to establish an agreement between two organizations. If the Acquisition process is invoked, it provides the means for conducting business with a supplier. This may include products that are supplied for use as an operational system, services in support of operational activities, or elements of a system being provided by a supplier. If the Supply process is invoked, it provides the means for an agreement in which the result is a product or service that is provided to the acquirer. NOTE Security is an increasing concern in systems engineering. See ISO/IEC 27036, Security techniques — Information security for supplier relationships, for requirements and guidance for suppliers and acquirers on how to secure information in supplier relationships. Specific aspects of information security supplier relationships are addressed in Parts 3 and Part 4. 6.1.1 Acquisition process 6.1.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Acquisition process is to obtain a product or service in accordance with the acquirer's requirements. NOTE As part of this process, the agreement is modified when a change request is agreed to by both the acquirer and supplier. 6.1.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Acquisition process: a) A request for supply is prepared. b) One or more suppliers are selected. c) An agreement is established between the acquirer and supplier. d) A product or service complying with the agreement is accepted. e) Acquirer obligations defined in the agreement are satisfied. 6.1.1.3 Activities and tasks The acquirer shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Acquisition process.

This activity consists of the following tasks:  1) Define a strategy for how the acquisition will be conducted. NOTE This strategy describes or references the life cycle model, risks and issues mitigation, a schedule of milestones, and selection criteria if the supplier is external to the acquiring organization. It also includes key drivers and characteristics of the acquisition, such as responsibilities and liabilities; specific models, methods, or processes; level of criticality; formality; and priority of relevant trade factors. 2) Prepare a request for the supply of a product or service that includes the requirements. NOTE 1 If a supplier is external to the organization, then the request includes the business practices with which a supplier is expected to comply and the criteria for selecting a supplier. NOTE 2 A definition of requirements is provided to one or more suppliers. The requirements are the stakeholder or the system requirements, depending on the type of acquisition approach, through the associated requirements definition process. NOTE 3 The acquirer develops the requirements by itself or retains a supplier to develop them. If the acquirer retains a supplier to develop requirements, the acquirer retains approval authority for the requirements developed by the supplier. b) Advertise the acquisition and select the supplier.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Communicate the request for the supply of a product or service to potential suppliers. 2) Select one or more suppliers. NOTE To obtain competitive solicitations, proposals to supply are evaluated and compared against the selection criteria and ranked.  The justification for rating each proposal is declared and suppliers are informed why they were or were not selected. c) Establish and maintain an agreement.  This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Project cost, schedule, and performance are monitored through the Project Assessment and Control process.  Any identified issues that require agreement modifications are referred to this activity.  Any proposals for changes to system elements or information are controlled through the Change Management activity of the Configuration Management process.  1) Develop an agreement with the supplier that includes acceptance criteria. NOTE 1 This agreement ranges in formality from a written contract to a verbal agreement.  Appropriate to the level of formality, the agreement establishes requirements, development and delivery milestones, verification, validation and acceptance conditions, exception-handling procedures, agreement change management procedures and payment schedules, so that both parties of the agreement understand the basis for executing the agreement.  Rights and restrictions associated with technical data and intellectual property are noted in the agreement.  Details are discussed and changed during negotiation, after which the acquirer and supplier accept the terms of an agreement and the agreement commences. For a written contract, this occurs when the contract is signed. NOTE 2 The agreement identifies any process requirements that need to be imposed on participating subcontractors, such as configuration management requirements, reporting of risks, and reporting of measures and measurement analysis. 2) Identify necessary changes to the agreement. NOTE In requesting a change to the agreement, the acquirer or the supplier details its specifications, rationale, and background. 3) Evaluate impact of changes on the agreement.

This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE The detail of the life cycle implementation within a project is dependent upon the complexity of the work, the methods used, and the skills and training of personnel involved in performing the work.  A project tailors policies, processes, models, and procedures according to its requirements and needs, while maintaining alignment with regulations and organizational policies.  Annex A contains information on tailoring. 1) Establish policies and procedures for process management and deployment that are consistent with organizational strategies. 2) Establish the processes that implement the requirements of this international standard and that are consistent with organizational strategies. 3) Define the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities to facilitate implementation of processes and the strategic management of life cycles.  4) Define business criteria that control progression through the life cycle. NOTE The decision-making criteria regarding entering and exiting each life cycle stage and key milestones are established. These are sometimes expressed in terms of business achievement.  5) Establish standard life cycle models for the organization that are comprised of stages, and define the purpose and outcomes for each stage.  NOTE The life cycle model comprises one or more stage models, as needed. It is assembled as a sequence of stages that overlap or iterate, as appropriate for the system-of-interest's scope, magnitude, complexity, changing needs and opportunities. Stages are illustrated in the ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) guide using a commonly encountered example of life cycle stages. Specific examples for systems are provided in ISO/IEC TR 24748-2 (IEEE Std 24748-2-2012). The life cycle processes and activities are selected, tailored as appropriate and employed in a stage to fulfill the purpose and outcomes of that stage.  b) Assess the process.  This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE ISO/IEC 15504 provides a more detailed set of process assessment activities and tasks that are aligned with the tasks shown below. 1) Monitor process execution across the organization. NOTE This includes the analysis of process measures and review of trends with respect to business criteria, feedback from the projects regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes, and monitoring execution according to regulations and organizational policies.  2) Conduct periodic reviews of the life cycle models used by the projects.

This process defines, provides and maintains the facilities, tools, and communications and information technology assets needed for the organization’s business with respect to the scope of this International Standard. 6.2.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Infrastructure Management process: a) The requirements for infrastructure are defined. b) The infrastructure elements are identified and specified. c) Infrastructure elements are developed or acquired. d) The infrastructure is available. 6.2.2.3 Activities and tasks The organization shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Infrastructure Management process. a) Establish the infrastructure.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define project infrastructure requirements. NOTE 1 Infrastructure element examples are facilities, tools, hardware, software, services, and standards. NOTE 2 The infrastructure resource needs for the project are considered in context with other projects and resources within the organization, as well as within the policies and strategic plans of the organization.  Business constraints and timelines that influence and control provision of infrastructure resources and services for the project are also evaluated. Project plans and future business needs contribute to the understanding of the resource infrastructure that is required.  Physical factors (e.g., facilities), logistics needs, and human factors (including health and safety aspects) are also considered. NOTE 3 ISO/IEC 27036, Information security for supplier relationships, provides guidance for addressing security of outsourced infrastructure. 2) Identify, obtain and provide infrastructure resources and services that are needed to implement and support projects. NOTE An inventory asset registry is often established to track infrastructure elements and support reuse.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Evaluate the degree to which delivered infrastructure resources satisfy project needs. 2) Identify and provide improvements or changes to the infrastructure resources as the project requirements change.  6.2.3 Portfolio management process 6.2.3.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Portfolio Management process is to initiate and sustain necessary, sufficient and suitable projects in order to meet the strategic objectives of the organization.  This process commits the investment of adequate organization funding and resources, and sanctions the authorities needed to establish selected projects.  It performs continued assessment of projects to confirm they justify, or can be redirected to justify, continued investment. 6.2.3.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Portfolio Management process: a) Business venture opportunities, investments or necessities are qualified and prioritized. b) Projects are identified. c) Resources and budgets for each project are allocated. d) Project management responsibilities, accountability, and authorities are defined. e) Projects meeting agreement and stakeholder requirements are sustained. f) Projects not meeting agreement or satisfying stakeholder requirements are redirected or terminated. g) Projects that have completed agreements and satisfied stakeholder requirements are closed. 6.2.3.3 Activities and tasks The organization shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Portfolio Management process. a) Define and authorize projects.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify potential new or modified capabilities or missions. NOTE The organization business strategy, concept of operations, or gap or opportunity analysis is reviewed for current gaps, problems, or opportunities. A new capability or enterprise need is usually determined in the Business or Mission Analysis process, further defined in the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process, and managed through this process. 2) Prioritize, select and establish new business opportunities, ventures or undertakings. NOTE These are usually consistent with the business strategy and action plans of the organization.  The potential projects are prioritized, and thresholds established, to determine which projects will be executed. The characteristics of identified projects are often determined, including stakeholder value, risks and barriers to success, dependencies and inter-relationships, constraints, resource needs and mutual contention for resources. Each potential project is then assessed with respect to likelihood of success and cost-benefit. The Decision Management and System Analysis processes provide details on performing an analysis of alternatives. 3) Define projects, accountabilities and authorities. 4) Identify the expected goals, objectives, and outcomes of each project.

NOTE 1 This includes the use or reuse of enabling systems used by more than one project and the use or reuse of common system elements by more than one project.  NOTE 2 Understanding each project in the context of the enterprise architecture helps to ensure interfaces and constraints are identified.  7) Specify the project reporting requirements and review milestones that govern the execution of each project. 8) Authorize each project to commence execution of project plans. NOTE Refer to Project Planning process for additional information on developing project plans. Project plans are most useful when developed and approved early in the project life cycle. b) Evaluate the portfolio of projects.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Evaluate projects to confirm ongoing viability. NOTE Viability includes: i) The project is making progress towards achieving established goals and objectives. ii)  The project is complying with project directives. iii) The project is being conducted according to project life cycle policies, processes, and procedures.  iv) The project remains viable, as indicated by, for example, continuing need for the service, practicable product implementation, and acceptable investment benefits. 2) Act to continue or redirect projects that are satisfactorily progressing or can be expected to progress satisfactorily by appropriate redirection. c) Terminate projects.  This activity consists of the following tasks:  1) Where agreements permit, act to cancel or suspend projects whose disadvantages or risks to the organization outweigh the benefits of continued investments. 2) After completion of the agreement for products and services, act to close the projects.

Individual Technical Management Processes may be invoked at any time in the life cycle and at any level in a hierarchy of projects, as required by plans or unforeseen events. The Technical Management Processes are applied with a level of rigor and formality that depends on the risk and complexity of the project. The scope of a technical management process is the technical management of a project or its products, to include the system. NOTE This set of technical management processes are performed so that system-specific technical processes can be conducted effectively.  They do not comprise a management system or a comprehensive set of processes for project management, as that is not the scope of this standard.  The Technical Management Processes consist of the following: a) Project Planning process; b) Project Assessment and Control process; c) Decision Management process; d) Risk Management process; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  32  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved e) Configuration Management process; f) Information Management process; g) Measurement process; h) Quality Assurance process. Project Planning and Project Assessment and Control are key to all management practices. These processes establish the general approach for managing a project or a process. The other processes in this group provide a specific focused set of tasks for performing to a specialized management objective. They are all evident in the management of any undertaking, ranging from a complete organization down to a single life cycle process and its tasks. In this International Standard, the project has been chosen as the context for describing processes. The same processes can also be applied in the performance of services. 6.3.1 Project planning process 6.3.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Project Planning process is to produce and coordinate effective and workable plans.  This process determines the scope of the project management and technical activities, identifies process outputs, tasks and deliverables, establishes schedules for task conduct, including achievement criteria, and required resources to accomplish tasks.  This is an on-going process that continues throughout a project, with regular revisions to plans. NOTE The strategies defined in each of the other processes provide inputs and are integrated in the Project Planning process. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to assess whether the plans are integrated, aligned, and feasible. 6.3.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Project Planning process: a) Objectives and plans are defined. b) Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, authorities are defined. c) Resources and services necessary to achieve the objectives are formally requested and committed. d) Plans for the execution of the project are activated. 6.3.1.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Project Planning process. a) Define the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks:  1) Identify the project objectives and constraints. NOTE 1 Objectives and constraints include performance and other quality aspects, cost, time and customer satisfaction.  Each objective is identified with a level of detail that permits selection, tailoring and implementation of the appropriate processes and activities. NOTE 2 ISO/IEC 15026, Systems and software assurance, and ISO/IEC 27036, Information security for supplier relationships, provide additional guidance on objectives and constraints related to assurance and security. 2) Define the project scope as established in the agreement. NOTE  This includes all the relevant activities required to satisfy business decision criteria and complete the project successfully. A project can have responsibility for one or more stages in the complete system life cycle.

NOTE  ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) provides detailed information regarding life cycle stages and the definition of an appropriate life cycle model.  It defines a general set of exemplar life cycle stages, including Concept, Development, Production, Utilization, Support and Retirement.  4) Establish a work breakdown structure based on the evolving system architecture. NOTE Each element of the system architecture, and appropriate processes and activities are described with a level of detail that is consistent with identified risks.  Related tasks in the work breakdown structure are grouped into project tasks.  Project tasks identify work items being developed or produced. The PMI Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures contains additional details on WBSs. 5) Define and maintain the processes that will be applied on the project. NOTE These processes are based on the defined processes of the organization (see Life Cycle Model Management process). Annex A contains information on tailoring that can be used to address project specific needs. The definition of the processes include the Entry Criteria; Inputs; Process sequence constraints (predecessor/successor relationships); Process Concurrency Requirements (what processes and tasks are worked concurrently with other process area tasks or activities); Measures of Effectiveness/Measures of Performance attributes; and Scope and Cost parameters (for critically important cost estimation). b) Plan project and technical management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define and maintain a project schedule based on management and technical objectives and work estimates. NOTE  This includes definition of the duration, relationship, dependencies and sequence of activities, achievement milestones, resources employed and the reviews and schedule reserves for risk management necessary to achieve timely completion of the project. 2) Define achievement criteria for the life cycle stage decision gates, delivery dates and major dependencies on external inputs or outputs. NOTE  The time intervals between internal reviews are defined in accordance with organizational policy on issues such as business and system criticality, schedule and technical risks. 3) Define the costs and plan a budget. NOTE  Costs are based on the schedule, labor estimates, infrastructure costs, procurement items, acquired service and enabling system estimates, and budget reserves for risk management. 4) Define roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. NOTE  This includes defining the project organization, staff acquisitions, and the development of staff skills.  Authorities include, as appropriate, the legally responsible roles and individuals, e.g., design authorization, safety authorization, and award of certification or accreditation. 5) Define the infrastructure and services required. NOTE  This includes defining the capacity needed, its availability and its allocation to project tasks.  Infrastructure includes facilities, tools, communications, and information technology assets.  The requirements for enabling systems for each life cycle stage are also specified. 6) Plan the acquisition of materials and enabling system services supplied from outside the project. NOTE  1 This includes, as necessary, plans for solicitation, supplier selection, acceptance, contract administration and contract closure.  The agreement processes are used for the planned acquisitions. NOTE 2 ISO/IEC 27036, Information security for supplier relationships, provides guidance for acquisition of infrastructure and services.

NOTE 1 Technical planning for the system is often captured in a Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP).  ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-4 provides more detail on the systems engineering technical planning and provides an annotated outline for a SEMP.   Software plans for a system are often captured in a Software Development Plan (SDP).  Planning for the project is often captured in a Project Management Plan.  ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326 provides more detail on project management.  NOTE 2 The strategy activities and tasks from each of the other processes provide inputs and are integrated in the Project Planning process. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to help ensure that the plans are integrated, aligned, and feasible. c) Activate the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks 1) Obtain authorization for the project. NOTE  The Portfolio Management process provides the authorization. 2) Submit requests and obtain commitments for necessary resources to perform the project.   3) Implement project plans.  6.3.2 Project assessment and control process 6.3.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Project Assessment and Control process is to assess if the plans are aligned and feasible; determine the status of the project, technical and process performance; and direct execution to help ensure that the performance is according to plans and schedules, within projected budgets, to satisfy technical objectives.  This process evaluates, periodically and at major events, the progress and achievements against requirements, plans and overall business objectives.  Information is provided for management action when significant variances are detected.  This process also includes redirecting the project activities and tasks, as appropriate, to correct identified deviations and variations from other technical management or technical processes.  Redirection may include re-planning as appropriate. 6.3.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Project Assessment and Control process: a) Performance measures or assessment results are available. b) Adequacy of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities is assessed. c) Adequacy of resources is assessed. d) Technical progress reviews are performed. e) Deviations in project performance from plans are investigated and analyzed. f) Affected stakeholders are informed of project status. g) Corrective action is defined and directed, when project achievement is not meeting targets. h) Project replanning is initiated, as necessary. i) Project action to progress (or not) from one scheduled milestone or event to the next is authorized. j) Project objectives are achieved.

This activity consists of the following task: 1) Define the project assessment and control strategy. NOTE  The strategy identifies the expected Project Assessment and Control activities, including planned assessment methods and timeframes, necessary management and technical reviews. b) Assess the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess alignment of project objectives and plans with the project context. 2) Assess management and technical plans against objectives to determine adequacy and feasibility. 3) Assess project and technical status against appropriate plans to determine actual and projected cost, schedule, and performance variances. 4) Assess the adequacy of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities.  NOTE  This includes assessment of the adequacy of personnel competencies to perform project roles and accomplish project tasks. Objective measures are used wherever possible, e.g., efficiency of resource use, project achievement. 5) Assess the adequacy and availability of resources. NOTE  Resources include infrastructure, personnel, funding, time, or other pertinent items. This includes confirming that intra-organizational commitments are satisfied. 6) Assess progress using measured achievement and milestone completion. NOTE  This includes collecting and evaluating data for labor, material, service costs, and technical performance, as well as other technical data about objectives, such as affordability. These are compared against measures of achievement.  This includes conducting effectiveness assessments to determine the adequacy of the evolving system against requirements.  It also includes the readiness of enabling systems to deliver their services when needed. 7) Conduct required management and technical reviews, audits and inspections. NOTE  These are formal or informal, and are conducted to determine readiness to proceed to the next stage of the life cycle or project milestone, to help ensure that project and technical objectives are being met, or to obtain feedback from stakeholders. 8) Monitor critical processes and new technologies. NOTE  This includes identifying and evaluating technology maturity and insertion. 9) Analyze measurement results and make recommendations. NOTE  Measurement results are analyzed to identify deviations, variations or undesirable trends from planned values that include potential concerns, and to make appropriate recommendations for corrections or preventive actions. This includes, where appropriate, statistical analysis of measures that indicates trends, e.g., fault density to indicate quality of outputs, distribution of measured parameters that indicate process repeatability.  10) Record and provide status and findings from assessment tasks. NOTE  These are generally designated in the agreement, policies and procedures. 11) Monitor process execution within the project.

Any improvement actions identified would be handled through the Quality Assurance process or the Life Cycle Model Management process. c) Control the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Initiate necessary actions needed to address identified issues. NOTE 1 This occurs when project or technical achievement is not meeting planned targets. This includes corrective, preventive, and problem resolution actions. Actions generally require replanning or reassignment of personnel, tools and infrastructure assets when inadequacy or unavailability has been detected, or when project or technical achievement exceeds targets or plan.  They often impact the cost, schedule, or technical scope or definition. Actions sometimes require changes to the implementation and execution of the life cycle processes. NOTE 2 Actions are recorded and reviewed to confirm their adequacy and timeliness. 2) Initiate necessary project replanning. NOTE 1 Project replanning is initiated when project objectives or constraints have changed, or when planning assumptions are shown to be invalid. NOTE 2 Any change that requires a change to the agreement between acquirer and supplier invokes the Acquisition and Supply Processes.  3) Initiate change actions when there is a contractual change to cost, time or quality due to the impact of an acquirer or supplier request. NOTE  This includes consideration of modified terms and conditions for supply or initiating new supplier selection, which invokes the Acquisition and Supply Processes. 4) Authorize the project to proceed toward the next milestone or event, if justified. NOTE  The Project Assessment and Control process is used to reach agreement on milestone completion 6.3.3 Decision management process 6.3.3.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Decision Management process is to provide a structured, analytical framework for objectively identifying, characterizing and evaluating a set of alternatives for a decision at any point in the life cycle and select the most beneficial course of action.   NOTE 1 This process is used to resolve technical or project issues and respond to requests for decisions encountered during the system life cycle, in order to identify the alternative(s) that provides the preferred outcomes for the situation. The methods most frequently used for Decision Management are the trade study and engineering analysis. Each of the alternatives is assessed against the decision criteria (e.g., cost impact, schedule impact, programmatic constraints, regulatory implications, technical performance characteristics, critical quality characteristics, and risk). Results of these comparisons are ranked, via a suitable selection model, and are then used to decide on an optimal solution. Key study data, (e.g., assumptions and decision rationale) are typically maintained to inform decision-makers, and support future decision-making.  NOTE 2 When it is necessary to perform a detailed assessment of a parameter for one of the criteria, the System Analysis process is employed to perform the assessment.  6.3.3.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Decision Management process: a) Decisions requiring alternative analysis are identified. b) Alternative courses of action are identified and evaluated. c) A preferred course of action is selected.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a decision management strategy.  NOTE A decision management strategy includes the identification of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities.  It includes the identification of decision categories and a prioritization scheme. Decisions often arise as a result of an effectiveness assessment, a technical trade-off, a problem needing to be solved, an action needed as a response to risk exceeding the acceptable threshold, or a new opportunity or approval for project progression to the next life cycle stage. Organization or project guidelines determine the degree of rigor and formality to apply to the decision analysis. 2) Identify the circumstances and need for a decision. NOTE Problems or opportunities and the alternative courses of action that will resolve their outcome are recorded, categorized and reported.  3) Involve relevant stakeholders in the decision-making in order to draw on experience and knowledge. NOTE It is good practice to identify the subject matter expertise needed for the analysis and the decision.  b) Analyze the decision information.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Select and declare the decision management strategy for each decision.  NOTE The degree of rigor required to resolve these problems or opportunities is determined, as well as the data and system analysis needed for evaluating the alternatives. 2) Determine desired outcomes and measurable selection criteria. NOTE The desired value for all quantifiable criteria and the threshold value(s) beyond which the attribute will be unsatisfactory are determined, as well as weighting factors for all criteria.  3) Identify the trade space and alternatives. NOTE If a large number of alternatives exist, they are qualitatively screened to reduce alternatives to a manageable number for further detailed systems analysis. This screening is often based on qualitative assessments of such factors as risk, cost, schedule, and regulatory impacts. 4) Evaluate each alternative, against the criteria. NOTE The System Analysis process is used, as necessary, to quantify specific criteria for each trade alternative to be evaluated. This includes new design parameters, different architecture characteristics, and range of values for critical quality characteristics. The System Analysis process assesses the range of parameter variations in order to obtain a sensitivity analysis for each of the trade alternatives evaluated.  These results are used to establish the feasibility of the various trade alternatives.  c) Make and manage decisions.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Determine preferred alternative for each decision. NOTE Alternatives are evaluated quantitatively, using the selection criteria. The selected alternative generally provides an optimization of, or improvement in, an identified decision.  2) Record the resolution, decision rationale, and assumptions. 3) Record, track, evaluate and report decisions.

NOTE 2 This allows the organization to confirm that problems have been effectively resolved, that adverse trends have been reversed, and that advantage has been taken of opportunities. 6.3.4 Risk management process 6.3.4.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Risk Management process is to identify, analyze, treat and monitor the risks continually.   The Risk Management process is a continual process for systematically addressing risk throughout the life cycle of a system product or service. It can be applied to risks related to the acquisition, development, maintenance or operation of a system. NOTE Risk is defined in ISO Guide 73:2009 as ""The effect of uncertainty on objectives"".  This has an attached NOTE 1, ""An effect is a deviation from the expected — positive and/or negative.""  A positive risk is sometimes commonly known as an opportunity, and addressed within the risk management process. 6.3.4.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Risk Management process: a) Risks are identified.  b) Risks are analyzed. c) Risk treatment options are identified, prioritized, and selected. d) Appropriate treatment is implemented. e) Risks are evaluated to assess changes in status and progress in treatment. 6.3.4.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Risk Management process. NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE 16085 provides a more detailed set of risk management activities and tasks. This risk management process is aligned with ISO 31000:2009 Risk management — Principles and Guidelines, and ISO Guide 73:2009, Risk management — Vocabulary. ISO 9001:2008 standard provides risk-based preventive action requirements in subclause 8.5.3. a) Plan risk management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the risk management strategy. NOTE This includes the risk management process of all supply chain suppliers and describes how risks from all suppliers will be raised to the next level(s) for incorporation in the project risk process. 2) Define and record the context of the Risk Management process.  NOTE 1 This includes a description of stakeholders’ perspectives, risk categories, and a description (perhaps by reference) of the technical and managerial objectives, assumptions and constraints. The risk categories include the relevant technical areas of the system and facilitate identification of risks across the life cycle of the system. As noted in ISO 31000 the aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list of risks based on those events that might create, enhance, prevent, degrade, accelerate or delay the achievement of objectives.   NOTE 2 Opportunities, which are one type of risk, provide potential benefits for the system or project.  Each of the opportunities pursued have associated risks that detract from the expected benefit.  This includes the risks associated with not pursuing an opportunity, as well as the risk of not achieving the effects of the opportunity.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define and record the risk thresholds and conditions under which a level of risk may be accepted.  2) Establish and maintain a risk profile.  NOTE The risk profile records: the risk management context; a record of each risk’s state including its likelihood of occurrence, consequences, and risk thresholds; the priority of each risk based on risk criteria supplied by the stakeholders; and the risk action requests along with the status of their treatment. The risk profile is updated when there are changes in an individual risk’s state. The priority in the risk profile is used to determine the application of resources for treatment. 3) Periodically provide the relevant risk profile to stakeholders based upon their needs.  c) Analyze risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify risks in the categories described in the risk management context.  NOTE Risks are commonly identified through various analyses, such as safety, reliability, producibility, and performance analyses; technology, architecture, and readiness assessments; and trade studies. These risks may be identified early in the life cycle and continue into the utilization, support, and retirement of the system. Additionally, risks are often identified through the analysis of the measures of the system. 2) Estimate the likelihood of occurrence and consequences of each identified risk.   3) Evaluate each risk against its risk thresholds.  4) For each risk that does not meet its risk threshold, define and record recommended treatment strategies and measures. NOTE Risk treatment strategies include, but are not limited to, eliminating the risk, reducing its likelihood of occurrence or severity of consequence, or accepting the risk. Treatments also include taking or increasing risk in order to pursue an opportunity. Measures provide information about the effectiveness of the treatment alternatives. d) Treat risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify recommended alternatives for risk treatment.  2) Implement risk treatment alternatives for which the stakeholders determine that actions should be taken to make a risk acceptable.  3) When the stakeholders accept a risk that does not meet its threshold, consider it a high priority and monitor it continually to determine if any future risk treatment actions are necessary.  4) Once a risk treatment is selected, coordinate management action.  NOTE Refer to Project Assessment and Control process. e) Monitor risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Continually monitor all risks and the risk management context for changes and evaluate the risks when their state has changed.  2) Implement and monitor measures to evaluate the effectiveness of risk treatments.  3) Continually monitor for the emergence of new risks and sources throughout the life cycle.  6.3.5 Configuration management process 6.3.5.1 Purpose  The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to manage and control system elements and configurations over the life cycle. CM also manages consistency between a product and its associated configuration definition.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a configuration management strategy. NOTE 1 This includes details covering: i) Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. ii) Disposition of, access to, release of and control of changes to configuration items. iii) The necessary baselines to be established.  iv) The locations and conditions of storage, the storage media and their environment, in accordance with designated levels of integrity, security and safety. v) The criteria or events for commencing configuration control and maintaining baselines of evolving configurations.  vi) The audit strategy and the responsibilities for assessing continual integrity and security of the configuration definition information. vii) Change management, including any planned configuration control boards, regular and emergency change requests; and procedures for change management. NOTE 2 The configuration management strategy needs to identify how configuration management will be coordinated across the set of acquirer, supplier, and supply chain organizations.  The strategy covers the life of the system, or the extent of the contract, as appropriate.  NOTE 3 Additional guidance regarding configuration management activities can be found in ISO 10007, IEEE Std 828, and ANSI EIA-649-B. Also, domain specific practices, such as SAE ARP4754A, Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems, provide additional application detail for the domain. 2) Define the archive and retrieval approach for configuration items, configuration management artifacts and data.  NOTE This includes data retention procedures.   b) Perform configuration identification. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the system elements and information items that are configuration items. Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  41 NOTE Configuration items receive special attention. They are usually assigned unique identifiers and are often the subject of reviews and configuration audits. Items subject to configuration control usually include requirements, product and system elements, information items, and baselines. 2) Identify the hierarchy and structure of system information. NOTE This includes product or system element hierarchy, system decomposition, etc. 3) Establish system, system element, and information item identifiers. NOTE Items are distinguished by unique, durable identifiers or markings, where appropriate. The identifiers are in accordance with relevant standards and product sector conventions, such that the items under configuration control are unambiguously traceable to their specifications or equivalent, recorded descriptions. 4) Define baselines through the life cycle. NOTE Baselines capture the evolving configuration states of system elements at designated times or under defined circumstances.  The content for the baselines is developed through the technical processes, but is formalized at a point in time through the CM process. Baselines form the basis for the next change. Selected baselines typically become formalized between acquirer and supplier, depending on the practices of the industry and the contractual involvement of the acquirer in the configuration management process.  There are generally three major types of baselines at the system level; functional baseline, allocated baseline, and product baseline.  These vary by domain or local strategy.   5) Obtain acquirer and supplier agreement to establish a baseline. NOTE The Project Assessment & Control process is used to reach agreement. c) Perform configuration change management. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Configuration change management establishes procedures and methods for managing change to a baseline once it is established.  This is sometimes referred to as configuration control. 1) Identify and record Requests for Change and Requests for Variance. NOTE A request for variance is sometimes referred to as a deviation, waiver, or concession. 2) Coordinate, evaluate, and disposition Requests for Change and Requests for Variance. NOTE This includes an impact assessment of proposed changes, including impact on project plans, costs, benefits, risks, quality, and schedule.  A decision is made on whether to implement or close the change request. 3) Submit requests for review and approval. NOTE Requests for Change and Requests for Variance are often under the formal control of a Configuration Control Board (CCB).  Evaluation includes analysis of need versus impact. 4) Track and manage approved changes to the baseline, Requests for Change, and Requests for Variance. NOTE 1 This task involves prioritization, tracking, scheduling, and closing changes.  Changes are then made through the Technical Processes.  These changes are verified or validated through the Verification and Validation Processes, to help ensure that the approved changes have been made. NOTE 2 Any changes and rationales are generally recorded. d) Perform configuration status accounting. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Develop and maintain the configuration management status information, for system elements, baselines, and releases. NOTE 1 Configuration status accounting provides the data on the status of controlled products needed to make decisions regarding system elements throughout the product life cycle.  This includes taking into account the nature of the items under configuration control. Configuration descriptions conform, where possible, to product or technology standards.  Configuration information permits forward and backward traceability to other configuration states.  The rationale for the baselines and releases and associated authorizations in configuration data are generally recorded.

NOTE 2 The recording, retrieval and consolidation of the current configuration status and the status of all preceding configurations to confirm information correctness, timeliness, integrity and security is managed. Audits are performed to verify conformance of a baseline to drawings, interface control documents and other agreement requirements. 2) Capture, store and report configuration management data. e) Perform configuration evaluation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the need for CM audits and schedule the events. 2) Verify the product configuration meets the configuration requirements. NOTE This is performed by comparing requirements, constraints, and waivers (variances) with results of formal verification activities. 3) Monitor the incorporation of  approved configuration changes. 4) Assess whether the system meets baseline functional and performance capabilities. NOTE This is sometimes called a functional configuration audit (FCA). 5) Assess whether the system conforms to the operational and configuration information items. NOTE This is sometimes called a physical configuration audit (PCA). 6) Record the CM audit results and disposition action items. f) Perform release control. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Approve system releases and deliveries.  NOTE 1 The purpose of a release is to authorize the use of a system for a specific purpose, with or without restrictions. Examples are releases for tests or for operational use.  NOTE 2 Releases generally include a set of changes. These changes are made through the Technical Processes, and then verified or validated through the Verification and Validation Processes. Approval of a release generally includes acceptance of the verified and validated changes. 2) Track and manage system releases and deliveries. NOTE Where appropriate, master copies of all system elements are generally maintained for the life of the system. The system elements are handled, stored, packaged, and delivered in accordance with the policies of the organizations involved. 6.3.6 Information management process 6.3.6.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Information Management process is to generate, obtain, confirm, transform, retain, retrieve, disseminate and dispose of information, to designated stakeholders. Information management plans, executes, and controls the provision of information to designated stakeholders that is unambiguous, complete, verifiable, consistent, modifiable, traceable, and presentable. Information includes technical, project, organizational, agreement, and user information. Information is often derived from data records of the organization, system, process, or project. 6.3.6.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Information Management process: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  43 a) Information to be managed is identified. b) Information representations are defined. c) Information is obtained, developed, transformed, stored, validated, presented, and disposed of. d) The status of information is identified. e) Information is available to designated stakeholders. 6.3.6.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Information Management process. NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 summarizes requirements for the content of life cycle process information items (documentation) and provides guidance on their development. a) Prepare for information management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the strategy for information management.  NOTE Information about the same topic can be developed in different ways at different points in the life cycle and for different audiences. 2) Define the items of information that will be managed.  NOTE This includes the information that will be managed during the system life cycle and possibly maintained for a defined period beyond.  This is done according to organizational policy, agreements, or legislation. 3) Designate authorities and responsibilities for information management. NOTE Due regard is paid to information and data legislation, security and privacy, e.g., ownership, agreement restrictions, rights of access, intellectual property and patents. Where restrictions or constraints apply, information is identified accordingly. Staff having knowledge of such items of information are informed of their obligations and responsibilities. 4) Define the content, formats and structure of information items. NOTE The information originates and terminates in many forms (e.g., audiovisual, textual, graphical, numerical) and mediums (e.g., electronic, printed, magnetic, optical).  Organization constraints, e.g., infrastructure, inter-organizational communications, and distributed project workings, are taken into account.  Relevant information item standards and conventions are used according to policy, agreements and legislation constraints. 5) Define information maintenance actions. NOTE Information maintenance includes status reviews of stored information for integrity, validity and availability.  It also includes any needs for replication or transformation to an alternative medium, as necessary, either to retain infrastructure as technology changes so that archived media can be read or to migrate archived media to newer technology. b) Perform information management.   This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain, develop, or transform the identified items of information. NOTE This includes collecting the data, information, or information items from appropriate sources (e.g., resulting from any life cycle process), and writing, illustrating, or transforming it into useable information for stakeholders. It includes reviewing, validating, and editing information per information standards. 2) Maintain information items and their storage records, and record the status of information. NOTE 1 Information items are maintained according to their integrity, security and privacy requirements. The status of information items is maintained, (e.g., version description, date of issue or validity date, record of distribution, security classification). Legible information is stored and retained in such a way that it is readily retrievable.

NOTE This includes the capture of lessons learned and the conduct of surveillance reviews of process implementation through the supply chain. e) Treat incidents and problems. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE 1 In the terminology of quality management, problems are often described as “non-conformities” which, if left untreated, could cause the project to fail to meet its requirements. NOTE 2 For additional information and examples of problem categories and priority classifications, see ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011), Annex C. 1) Incidents are recorded, analyzed and classified. 2) Incidents are resolved or elevated to problems. 3) Problems are recorded, analyzed and classified. NOTE Analysis results include potential treatment options. 4) Treatments for problems are prioritized and implementation is tracked. NOTE Implementation is done in the Technical Processes after initiation by the Project Assessment and Control Process. 5) Trends in incidents and problems are noted and analyzed. 6) Stakeholders are informed of the status of incidents and problems. 7) Incidents and problems are tracked to closure. 6.4 Technical processes The Technical Processes are used to define the requirements for a system, to transform the requirements into an effective product, to permit consistent reproduction of the product where necessary, to use the product to provide the required services, to sustain the provision of those services and to dispose of the product when it is retired from service. The Technical Processes define the activities that enable organization and project functions to optimize the benefits and reduce the risks that arise from technical decisions and actions.  These activities enable products and services to possess the timeliness and availability, the cost effectiveness, and the functionality, reliability, maintainability, producibility, usability and other qualities required by acquiring and supplying organizations.  They also enable products and services to conform to the expectations or legislated requirements of society, including health, safety, security and environmental factors. The Technical Processes consist of the following: a) Business or Mission Analysis process; b) Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process; c) System Requirements Definition process; d) Architecture Definition process; e) Design Definition process; f) System Analysis process; g) Implementation process; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  48  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved h) Integration process; i) Verification process; j) Transition process; k) Validation process; l) Operation process; m) Maintenance process; n) Disposal process. NOTE 1 For software and hardware system elements, these processes are applied at recursively lower levels for system definition and recursively higher levels for system realization for stakeholder needs and requirements definition, system requirements definition, architecture definition, design definition, system analysis, integration, verification and validation. NOTE 2 These processes are often performed concurrently, iterating between one another to establish a solution that is balanced with respect to requirements, critical performance measures, and critical quality characteristics. At any level of abstraction, system requirements and models are made consistent via iterations of applicable technical processes. When requirements and models are not directly capable of being implemented, the same processes are repeated recursively at a more detailed level, e.g., the next lower level of the system hierarchy. NOTE 3 The concept of life cycle stages and the application of these processes in any stage are described in detail in ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011).  It has a complete set of example stages and stage outcomes for the enactment of technical processes within a system life cycle.  NOTE 4 Interface Management is a set of activities that cut across the systems engineering processes. These are cross-cutting activities of the Technical and Technical Management processes that apply and track as a specific view of the processes and system. See Annex E of this standard for an example Interface Management Process View and the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook, Version 4, section 9.6 for more information. 6.4.1 Business or mission analysis process 6.4.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Business or Mission Analysis process is to define the business or mission problem or opportunity, characterize the solution space, and determine potential solution class(es) that could address a problem or take advantage of an opportunity. NOTE 1 Business and Mission Analysis is related to the organization encompassing all stakeholders concerned by the activities of the system life cycle. This process interacts with the organization's strategy, which is generally outside the scope of 15288. The results of the organization's strategic analysis include the organizational Concept of Operations, strategic goals and plans, new market or mission elements, and identified problems and opportunities. The organization's strategy establishes the context within which the business or mission analysis is performed.  The organizational Concept of Operations relates to the leadership's intended way of operating the organization. It describes the organization’s assumptions and how it intends to use the system to be developed, existing systems, and possible future systems in support of an overall operation or series of operations of the business. In the case that the organization is the system-of-interest, the organization’s strategy is part of the system definition. NOTE 2 This process has application through the life of the system solution and is revisited if there are changes in the environment, needs, or other drivers. NOTE 3 In some domains, this relates to the concept of identifying and analyzing capabilities that are needed or desired by the organization.  This process focuses on the necessary capabilities and interacts with the Portfolio Management process for identifying the trade space that can address the capability.  The identified problems or opportunities are often translated into target capabilities.  As applicable within a given domain, the problem or opportunity space includes the target capabilities. 6.4.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Business or Mission Analysis process: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  49 a) The problem or opportunity space is defined. b) The solution space is characterized.  c) Preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in the life cycle stages are defined. d) Candidate alternative solution classes are identified and analyzed.  e) The preferred candidate alternative solution class(es) are selected. f) Any enabling systems or services needed for business or mission analysis are available. g) Traceability of business or mission problems and opportunities and the preferred alternative solution classes is established. 6.4.1.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Business or Mission Analysis process. a) Prepare for business or mission analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review identified problems and opportunities in the organization strategy with respect to desired organization goals or objectives. NOTE This includes problems or opportunities with respect to the organization business or mission, vision, Concept of Operations, and other organization strategic goals and objectives.  This includes identified deficiencies or gaps in existing capabilities, systems, products, or services. 2) Define the business or mission analysis strategy.  NOTE This includes the approach to be used to identify and define the problem space, characterize the solution space and select a solution class. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support business or mission analysis. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for enabling systems. Enabling systems for business or mission analysis include the business systems and repositories of the organization. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define the problem or opportunity space. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Analyze the problems and opportunities in the context of relevant trade-space factors. NOTE 1 This analysis is focused on understanding the scope, basis, or drivers of the problems or opportunities, as opposed to the synthesis that is the focus of system analysis and decision management needed for trade studies.  The focus here includes changes in mission requirements, business opportunities, capabilities, performance improvement, or lack of existing systems, security and safety improvement, factors such as cost and effectiveness, regulation changes, user dissatisfaction, and PESTEL factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal). This may be accomplished through external, internal, or SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis.   NOTE 2 The outputs of the analysis are considered as part of the portfolio management decisions. 2) Define the mission, business, or operational problem or opportunity. NOTE This definition includes the context and any key parameters, without regard to a specific solution, since the solution could be an operational change, a change to an existing product or service, or a new system.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in life cycle stages. NOTE 1 This involves the identification of major stakeholder groups such as customers, users, administrations, regulators, and system owners. that are defined in the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. NOTE 2 Preliminary life cycle concepts include preliminary acquisition concepts, preliminary deployment concepts, preliminary operational concepts, preliminary support concepts, and preliminary retirement concepts.  Operational concepts include high level operational modes or states, operational scenarios, potential use cases, or usage within a proposed business strategy. These concepts enable feasibility analysis and evaluation of alternatives. These concepts are further refined within the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process.  NOTE 3 The operating environment may be known to have vulnerabilities associated with specific security threats and safety hazards.  These vulnerabilities need to be understood in association with the product under development. The system and human interfaces are an element of the system assurance context and related vulnerabilities are examined in the context of mission critical threads. 2) Identify candidate alternative solution classes that span the potential solution space. NOTE These may range from simple operational changes to various system developments or modifications. The solution space can include the identification of existing systems, products, and services that can address the need for operational or functional modifications. This includes deducing what potential expected services will be needed. The solution space characterization often invokes the Architecture Definition process for a user architecture viewpoint resulting in architecture views (e.g., capability views, program views and operational views) as proposed by ISO/IEC 42010. d) Evaluate alternative solution classes. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess each alternative solution class. NOTE 1 Each alternative solution class is assessed against defined criteria that are established based on the organization's strategy. Feasibility of the solution class is one key decision criteria. The Portfolio Management process provides some criteria to be considered.  NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess the value of each criterion for each alternative solution class.  Structured affordability trade-offs are recommended. Including cost as a criterion will aid affordability decisions.  The assessment of alternatives can include modeling, simulation, analytical techniques, or expert judgment to understand the risks, feasibility and value of the alternative candidate solution classes. 2) Select the preferred alternative solution class(es). NOTE The Decision Management process is used to evaluate alternatives and to guide selection. Selected alternatives are validated in the context of the organization's strategy. Feedback on risks, feasibility, market factors, and alternatives is provided for use in updating the organization's strategy. e) Manage the business or mission analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Maintain traceability of business or mission analysis. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the business and mission problems and opportunities and the preferred alternative solution classes with the organizational strategy, stakeholder needs and requirements, and system analysis results supporting decisions. 2) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Business or Mission Analysis) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM.

It identifies stakeholders, or stakeholder classes, involved with the system throughout its life cycle, and their needs. It analyzes and transforms these needs into a common set of stakeholder requirements that express the intended interaction the system will have with its operational environment and that are the reference against which each resulting operational capability is validated. The stakeholder requirements are defined considering the context of the system-of-interest with the interoperating systems and enabling systems. 6.4.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process: a) Stakeholders of the system are identified. b) Required characteristics and context of use of capabilities and concepts in the life cycle stages, including operational concepts, are defined. c) Constraints on a system are identified. d) Stakeholder needs are defined. e) Stakeholder needs are prioritized and transformed into clearly defined stakeholder requirements. f) Critical performance measures are defined. g) Stakeholder agreement that their needs and expectations are reflected adequately in the requirements is achieved. h) Any enabling systems or services needed for stakeholder needs and requirements are available. i) Traceability of stakeholder requirements to stakeholders and their needs is established. 6.4.2.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. a) Prepare for stakeholder needs and requirements definition. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the system throughout its life cycle. NOTE This includes individuals and classes of stakeholders who are users, operators, supporters, developers, producers, trainers, maintainers, disposers, acquirer and supplier organizations, parties responsible for external interfacing entities, regulatory bodies and others who have a legitimate interest in the system.  Where direct communication is not practicable (e.g., for consumer products and services), representatives or designated proxy stakeholders are selected. 2) Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy.  NOTE Some stakeholders have interests that oppose the system or oppose each other.  When the stakeholder interests oppose each other, but do not oppose the system, this process is intended to gain consensus among the stakeholder classes to establish a common set of acceptable requirements. The intent or desires of those that oppose the system, or detractors of the system, are addressed through the Risk Management process, threat analyses of the System Analysis process, or the system requirements for security, adaptability, or resilience.  In this case, the stakeholder needs are not satisfied, but rather addressed in a manner to help ensure system assurance and integrity if actions from the detractors are encountered.

NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for stakeholder needs and requirements definition include tools for facilitation and requirements management. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define stakeholder needs. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts. NOTE Context of use is often captured using a Context of Use Description [ISO/IEC 25063.3]. Preliminary life cycle concepts are developed by the Business or Mission Analysis process.  2) Identify stakeholder needs. NOTE 1 Identification of stakeholder needs includes elicitation of needs directly from the stakeholder, identification of implicit stakeholder needs based on domain knowledge and context understanding, and documented gaps from previous activities. Needs often include measures of effectiveness.  Functional analysis is often used to aid the elicitation of needs. Also quality characteristics of the quality model in ISO/IEC 25010 and quality model application to requirements analysis in ISO/IEC 25030 are useful to elicit and identify quality requirements of non-functional requirements, which are often implicit stakeholder needs. NOTE 2 Stakeholder needs describe the needs, wants, desires, expectations and perceived constraints of identified stakeholders. Understanding stakeholder needs for the minimum security and privacy requirements necessary for the operational environment minimizes the  potential for disruption in plans, schedules, and performance. If significant issues are likely to arise relating to users and other stakeholders and their involvement in or interaction with a system, recommendations for identifying and treating human-system issues can be found in ISO TS 18152. 3) Prioritize and down-select needs. NOTE The Decision Management process is typically used to support prioritization.  The System Analysis process is used to analyze needs for feasibility or other factors. 4) Define the stakeholder needs and rationale. NOTE Needs concentrate on system purpose and behavior, and are described in the context of the operational environment and conditions.  It is useful to trace needs to their sources and rationale.  c) Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Other life cycle concepts can include acquisition concepts, deployment concepts, support concepts, security concepts, and retirement concepts.  In this activity, the preliminary life cycle concepts defined within the Business or Mission Analysis process are further developed in the context of specific stakeholder needs, as associated scenarios and interactions are defined.  See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on operational concepts, and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 Annex A for an annotated outline for a System Operational Concept. 1) Define a representative set of scenarios to identify all required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts. NOTE 1 Scenarios are used to analyze the operation of the system in its intended environment in order to identify additional needs or requirements that possibly have not been explicitly identified by any of the stakeholders, e.g., legal, regulatory and social obligations.  The context of use of the system is identified and analyzed, including the activities that users perform to achieve system objectives, the relevant characteristics of the end users of the system (e.g., expected training, degree of fatigue), the physical environment (e.g., available light, temperature) and any equipment to be used (e.g., protective or communication equipment). The social and organizational influences on users that could affect system use or constrain its design are analyzed when applicable. Scenarios centered on attackers, their environments, tools, techniques, and capabilities are key considerations for operational concept development. Scenarios are prioritized in order to reflect the weighted importance of the various operational needs.

Abuse and failure scenarios highlight the need for additional functional requirements (or more specific derived requirements) to mitigate risks that are identified in the abuse or failure scenarios. 2) Identify the interaction between users and the system. NOTE 1 Usability requirements take into account human capabilities and skills limitations. Where possible, applicable standards, e.g., ISO 9241, and accepted professional practices are used in order to define: i) Physical, mental, and learned capabilities. ii) Work place, environment and facilities, including other equipment in the context of use. iii) Normal, unusual, and emergency conditions. iv) Operator and user recruitment, training and culture. NOTE 2 If usability is important, usability requirements are planned, specified, and implemented through the life cycle processes. Refer to ISO TS 18152 for information on human-system issues and ISO/IEC 25060:2010 for information on usability.  d) Transform stakeholder needs into stakeholder requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the constraints on a system solution.  NOTE These result from 1) instances or areas of stakeholder-defined solution; 2) implementation decisions made at higher levels of system hierarchical structure; 3) required use of defined enabling, legacy, or interfacing systems or system elements, resources and staff; or 4) stakeholder defined affordability objectives. Include those that are unavoidable consequences of existing agreements, management decisions and technical decisions. 2) Identify the stakeholder requirements and functions that relate to critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, environment, or health. NOTE 1 See ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 for additional information on system and software assurance. NOTE 2 Identifying safety risks facilitates the identification of safety requirements and functions. Safety risks include those associated with methods of operations and support, health and safety, threats to property and environmental influences.  Use applicable standards, e.g., IEC 61508, and accepted professional practices.  NOTE 3 Identifying security risks facilitates the identification of additional security requirements and functions. If warranted, include applicable areas of system security, including physical, procedural, communications, computers, programs, data and emissions.  This includes access and damage to protected personnel, properties and information, compromise of sensitive information, and denial of approved access to property and information.  This also includes the required security functions, such as mitigation and containment, referencing applicable standards and accepted professional practices where mandatory or relevant. NOTE 4 See ISO/IEC 25030 for further information regarding quality characteristics from a quality in use perspective. 3) Define stakeholder requirements, consistent with life cycle concepts, scenarios, interactions, constraints, and critical quality characteristics. NOTE 1 See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on stakeholder requirements, and clauses 8 and 9 for a description of and an annotated outline for a Stakeholder Requirements Specification. NOTE 2 The stakeholder requirements are reviewed at key decision times in the life cycle to help ensure that account is taken of any changes of need. NOTE 3 The stakeholder requirements are recorded in a form suitable for requirements management through the life cycle. These records establish the stakeholder requirements baseline, and retain changes of need and their origin throughout the system life cycle. These records are the basis for traceability to decisions made by the Business or Mission Analysis process as well as stakeholder needs, system requirements, and subsequent system elements. NOTE 4  The stakeholder requirements are the basis of the validation criteria for the system and system elements.   e) Analyze stakeholder requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  54  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved 1) Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements. NOTE 1 Stakeholder requirements are analyzed for characteristics of individual requirements, as well as characteristics of the set of requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements are necessary, implementation free, unambiguous, consistent, complete, singular, feasible, traceable, verifiable, affordable, and bounded. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 provides additional information on characteristics of requirements. NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess feasibility and affordability. The Verification and Validation processes are used in the review of stakeholder requirements. 2) Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement. NOTE This includes defining technical and quality measures and critical performance parameters associated with each effectiveness measure identified in the stakeholder requirements. The critical performance measures (e.g., measures of effectiveness and measures of suitability) are defined, analyzed and reviewed to help ensure stakeholder requirements are met and to help ensure identification of project cost, schedule or performance risk associated with any non-compliance. ISO/IEC 15939 (IEEE Std 15939-2007) provides a process to identify, define and use appropriate measures. INCOSE TP-2003-020-01, Technical Measurement, provides information on the selection, definition and implementation of critical performance measures. The ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards provides relevant quality measures. 3) Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed. 4) Resolve stakeholder requirements issues. NOTE This includes requirements that violate the characteristics for individual requirements or the set of requirements as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. f) Manage the stakeholder needs and requirements definition.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain explicit agreement on the stakeholder requirements. NOTE This includes confirming that stakeholder requirements are expressed correctly, comprehensible to originators, and that the resolution of conflict in the requirements has not corrupted or compromised stakeholder intentions. 2) Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.  NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the stakeholder needs and requirements and the stakeholders and sources, organizational strategy, and business and mission problems and opportunities. Additional traceability to systems making up the system solution facilitates the transition to the System Requirements Definition process. This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 3) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the stakeholder needs, stakeholder requirements, and operational concept are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.3  System requirements definition process 6.4.3.1 Purpose  The purpose of the System Requirements Definition process is to transform the stakeholder, user-oriented view of desired capabilities into a technical view of a solution that meets the operational needs of the user.   This process creates a set of measurable system requirements that specify, from the supplier’s perspective, what characteristics, attributes, and functional and performance requirements the system is to possess, in order to satisfy stakeholder requirements. As far as constraints permit, the requirements should not imply any specific implementation.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the functional boundary of the system in terms of the behavior and properties to be provided. NOTE The functional boundary definition is partly based on the context of use and operational scenarios defined in the frame of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. This includes the system’s stimuli and its responses to user and environment behavior, and an analysis and description of the required interactions between the system and its environment in terms of interface properties and constraints, such as mechanical, electrical, mass, thermal, data, and procedural flows.  This establishes the expected system behavior, expressed in quantitative terms, at its boundary. 2) Define the system requirements definition strategy.  NOTE This includes the approach to be used to identify and define the system requirements, and manage the requirements through the life cycle. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support system requirements definition. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for system requirements definition include tools for facilitation and requirements management. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define each function that the system is required to perform. NOTE 1 This includes how well the system, including its operators, is required to perform that function, the conditions under which the system is to be capable of performing the function, the conditions under which the system is to commence performing that function and the conditions under which the system is to cease performing that function. In some cases, functions are derived from analysis of critical quality characteristics (e.g., system diagnosing function or highly frequent data backup function for reliability). NOTE 2 Conditions for the performance of functions can incorporate reference to required states and modes of operation of the system.  System requirements depend heavily on abstract representations of proposed system characteristics and sometimes employ multiple modeling techniques and perspectives to give a sufficiently complete description of the desired system requirements.  Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  56  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved NOTE 3 Enabling functions that are required to support the system-of-interest in achieving its functionality are also identified and defined concurrently with the function of the system-of-interest. This is necessary to help ensure that the enabling functions are identified and accounted for. 2) Define necessary implementation constraints. NOTE This includes the implementation decisions that are allocated from architecture definition at higher levels in the structure of the system and are introduced by stakeholder requirements or are solution limitations.  3) Identify system requirements that relate to risks, criticality of the system, or critical quality characteristics. NOTE Critical quality characteristics commonly include those related to health, safety, security assurance, reliability, availability and supportability. This includes analysis and definition of safety considerations, including those relating to methods of operation and maintenance, environmental influences and personnel injury.  It also includes helping to ensure each safety related function and its associated safety integrity, is expressed in terms of the necessary risk reduction, and is specified and allocated to designated safety-related systems.  Applicable standards are used concerning functional safety, e.g., IEC 61508, and environmental protection, e.g., ISO 14001. Analyze security considerations including those related to compromise and protection of sensitive information, data and material.  The security-related risks are defined, including, but not limited to, administrative, personnel, physical, computer, communication, network, emission and environment factors using, as appropriate, applicable security standards. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026-4 for system and software assurance guidance. ISO/IEC 27036 provides guidance for information security requirements for the outsourcing of products and services. ISO 25030 provides guidance for external system quality factors and characteristics. For systems intended for human interaction, human-factors engineering (ergonomics) specifications are considered. For systems that have usability requirements, recommendations for obtaining a desired level of usability can be found in ISO TR 18529, Ergonomics—Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Human-centred life cycle process descriptions. 4) Define system requirements and rationale. NOTE 1 This includes defining system requirements consistent with stakeholder requirements, functional boundaries, functions, constraints, cost targets, identified interfaces, and critical quality characteristics. Consistent practice has shown this process requires iterative and recursive steps in parallel with other life cycle processes through the system hierarchy.  See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on system requirements, and clauses 8 and 9 for a description of and an annotated outline for a System Requirements Specification. NOTE 2 The system requirements are recorded in a form suitable for requirements management through the life cycle. These records establish the system requirements baseline, and include the associated rationale, decisions and assumptions.  They are the basis for traceability to information items and subsequent system elements. Change requests of system requirements also provide rationale to help in the determination of the acceptability of the proposed change, including consistency with stakeholder requirements.  NOTE 3 The System Analysis Process is used to determine appropriate values for requirement parameters, considering the estimated cost, schedule, and technical performance of the system.  The Validation Process is used to determine if the requirements address the stakeholders’ needs.  The Verification Process determines the quality of the requirements with respect to the attributes and characteristics of good requirements (refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148).   c) Analyze system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Analyze the complete set of system requirements. NOTE 1 System requirements are analyzed for characteristics of individual requirements, as well as characteristics of the set of requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements are necessary, implementation free, unambiguous, consistent, complete, singular, feasible, traceable, verifiable, affordable, and bounded.  ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 provides additional information on characteristics of requirements. Deficiencies, conflicts and weaknesses are identified and resolved within the complete set of system requirements. NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess feasibility, affordability, and balance.  2) Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement. NOTE This includes defining technical and quality measures and critical performance parameters associated with each effectiveness measure identified in the system requirements. The critical performance measures (e.g., measures of performance and technical performance measures) are analyzed and reviewed to help ensure system requirements Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  57 are met and to help ensure identification of project cost, schedule or performance risk associated with any non-compliance. ISO/IEC 15939 (IEEE Std 15939-2007) provides a process to identify, define and use appropriate measures. INCOSE TP-2003-020-01, Technical Measurement, provides information on the selection, definition and implementation of critical performance measures. The ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards provides relevant quality measures. 3) Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders for review. NOTE Feedback helps ensure that the specified system requirements have been adequately captured and expressed. Confirmation is made that they are a necessary and sufficient response to stakeholder requirements and a necessary and sufficient input to other processes, in particular architecture and design. This is one application of the Validation Process applied for the specific requirements. 4) Resolve system requirements issues. NOTE This includes requirements that violate the characteristics for individual requirements or the set of requirements as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. d) Manage system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Maintaining system requirements includes defining, recording, and controlling the baseline, generally under formal configuration management, along with managing any changes resulting from the application of other life cycle processes such as architecture or design. 1) Obtain explicit agreement on the system requirements. NOTE This includes confirming that system requirements are expressed correctly, comprehensible to originators, and that the resolution of conflict in the requirements has not corrupted or compromised stakeholder intentions. 2) Maintain traceability of the system requirements. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the system requirements and the stakeholder requirements, architecture elements, interface definitions, analysis results, verification methods or techniques, and allocated, decomposed, and derived requirements.  This helps ensure that all achievable stakeholder requirements are met by one or more system requirements, and all system requirements meet or contribute to meeting at least one stakeholder requirement.  This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 3) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (System Requirements Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the system requirements are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.4 Architecture definition process  6.4.4.1 Purpose The purpose of the Architecture Definition process is to generate system architecture alternatives, to select one or more alternative(s) that frame stakeholder concerns and meet system requirements, and to express this in a set of consistent views.  Iteration of the Architecture Definition process with the Business or Mission Analysis process, System Requirements Definition process, Design Definition process, and Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process is often employed so that there is a negotiated understanding of the problem to be solved and a satisfactory solution is  identified. The results of the Architecture Definition process are widely used across the life cycle processes. Architecture definition may be applied at many levels of abstraction, highlighting the relevant detail that is necessary for the decisions at that level. NOTE 1 System architecture deals with fundamental principles, concepts, properties, and characteristics and their incorporation into the system-of-interest. Architecture definition has more uses than as merely a driver (or part of) design.  Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 for more information about architecture description and the uses and nature of architecture. NOTE 2 The Architecture Definition process supports identification of stakeholders and their concerns. As the process unfolds, insights are gained into the relation between the requirements specified for the system and the emergent Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  58  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved properties and behaviors of the system that arise from the interactions and relations between the system elements. The Design Definition process (see subclause 6.4.5), on the other hand, is driven by requirements that have been vetted through the architecture and more detailed analyses of feasibility. Architecture focuses on suitability, viability, and desirability, whereas design focuses on compatibility with technologies and other design elements and feasibility of construction and integration. An effective architecture is as design-agnostic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility in the design trade space. An effective architecture also highlights and supports trade-offs for the Design Definition process and possibly other processes such as Portfolio Management, Project Planning, System Requirements Definition, and Verification. NOTE 3 In product line architectures, the architecture is necessarily spanning across several designs. The architecture serves to make the product line cohesive and helps ensure compatibility and interoperability across the product line. Even for a single product system, the design of the product will likely change over time while the architecture remains constant.  6.4.4.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Architecture Definition process: a) Identified stakeholder concerns are addressed by the architecture. b) Architecture viewpoints are developed. c) Context, boundaries, and external interfaces of the system are defined. d) Architecture views and models of the system are developed. e) Concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the system are allocated to architectural entities. f) System elements and their interfaces are identified. g) Architecture candidates are assessed. h) An architectural basis for processes throughout the life cycle is achieved. i) Alignment of the architecture with requirements and design characteristics is achieved. j) Any enabling systems or services needed for architecture definition are available. k) Traceability of architecture elements to stakeholder and system requirements is developed. 6.4.4.3 Activities and tasks  The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Architecture Definition process. a) Prepare for architecture definition. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review pertinent information and identify key drivers of the architecture. NOTE Key drivers are identified by reviewing: (a) market studies, industry projections, competitor product plans, and scientific findings; (b) organizational strategies, organizational-level concept of operations, organizational policies and directives, regulatory and legal constraints, and stakeholder requirements; (c) mission or business concept of operations, system operational concept, operational environment, technology roadmaps, and system requirements; and (d) any other factors that impact the suitability of the system through its life cycle. 2) Identify stakeholder concerns. NOTE Stakeholders are initially identified in the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements process.  Additional stakeholders are usually identified during the Architecture Definition process. Stakeholder concerns related to architecture are expectations or constraints associated with the system life cycle stages such as utilization (e.g., availability, security, effectiveness, usability), support (e.g., reparability, obsolescence management), evolutionary development of the system and of the environment (e.g., adaptability, scalability, survivability), production (e.g., producibility, testability), retirement (e.g., environmental impact, transportability), etc.  This also includes concerns Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  59 that the system will be compromised intentionally or unintentionally via a threat agent or accidentally via a safety hazard. 3) Define the architecture definition roadmap, approach, and strategy. NOTE This includes the identification of stakeholder engagement opportunities, the definition of architecture review activities, evaluation approach and criteria, measurement approach, and measurement methods (refer to the Measurement process). The roadmap shows how the architecture will evolve to an envisioned end state and often has a longer timeframe than for the current system-of-interest. The approach is the manner in which the work will be accomplished, such as how to engage with stakeholders, how to vet the results, or where to do the work. The strategy deals with the systematic plan of action for implementing the approach consistent with the roadmap. 4) Define evaluation criteria based on stakeholder concerns and key requirements. 5) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support the Architecture Definition process. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling system. Enabling systems for architecture definition include tools for collaboration and architecture development, and architecture reuse repositories (for architecture patterns, architecture artifacts, reference architectures, etc.). 6) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Develop architecture viewpoints. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Select, adapt, or develop viewpoints and model kinds based on stakeholder concerns. 2) Establish or identify potential architecture framework(s) to be used in developing models and views. NOTE Some architecture frameworks identify stakeholders and their concerns, and relevant viewpoints that address those concerns, while other architecture frameworks are more general in their guidance. Viewpoints specify the kinds of models to be used and how the resulting models can be used to generate architecture views. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for more information on architecture framework and architecture description practices. 3) Capture rationale for selection of framework(s), viewpoints and model types. 4) Select or develop supporting modeling techniques and tools. c) Develop models and views of candidate architectures. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the system context and boundaries in terms of interfaces and interactions with external entities. NOTE This task is mainly based on the outcomes of the Business or Mission Analysis process, and is performed concurrently with the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. It consists of identifying the entities external to the system (i.e., existing and projected systems, products, and services that constitute the system context) and defining the boundaries of the system (i.e., interactions with these external entities through the interfaces that cross the boundaries). The external entities could include the necessary enabling systems. The Architecture Definition process defines interfaces to the extent needed to support essential architectural decisions and understanding.  These interface definitions are then refined by the Design Definition process. 2) Identify architectural entities and relationships between entities that address key stakeholder concerns and critical system requirements. NOTE Architecture is not necessarily concerned with all requirements, but rather only with those that drive the architecture. On the other hand, the Design Definition process takes into account all the requirements. Sometimes, through the Architecture Definition process there will be requirements that are deemed to be inappropriate, unaffordable, or unsuitable. These are requirements issues that are resolved through iteration of the System Requirements Definition process. It is also important that the architecture addresses key stakeholder concerns since not all of these will be captured in requirements.

NOTE The items being allocated to could be physical, logical, or conceptual. 4) Select, adapt, or develop models of the candidate architectures of the system. NOTE It is common to use models in architecture definition. The models used are those that best address key stakeholder concerns. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for how this can be done. Historically, it has been common to use logical and physical models in architecture definition. Information on logical, physical, and other models is provided in Annex F.  5) Compose views from the models in accordance with identified viewpoints to express how the architecture addresses stakeholder concerns and meets stakeholder and system requirements. 6) Harmonize the architecture models and views with each other.  NOTE Correspondence rules from frameworks are one way to establish harmony between views. See ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. d) Relate the architecture to design. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify system elements that relate to architectural entities and the nature of these relationships. NOTE Sometimes the system elements are initially notional until Design Definition has occurred since this depends on the actual design(s) to be done. Sometimes a “reference architecture” is created using these notional system elements as a means to convey architectural intent and to check for design feasibility. 2) Define the interfaces and interactions between the system elements and with external entities. NOTE This is defined at level of detail necessary to convey the architectural intent and can be further refined in the Design Definition process. 3) Partition, align and allocate requirements to architectural entities and system elements. 4) Map system elements and architectural entities to design characteristics.   5) Define principles for the system design and evolution. e) Assess architecture candidates. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess each candidate architecture against constraints and requirements. 2) Assess each candidate architecture against stakeholder concerns using evaluation criteria. NOTE The System Analysis process and the Risk Management process can be used to support this task. 3) Select the preferred architecture(s) and capture key decisions and rationale. NOTE The Decision Management process can be used to support this task. 4) Establish the architecture baseline of the selected architecture. NOTE The architecture baseline is composed of models, views and other relevant architecture descriptions. f) Manage the selected architecture. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Formalize the architecture governance approach and specify governance related roles and responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities (related to design, quality, security, safety, etc.). 2) Obtain explicit acceptance of the architecture by stakeholders.

NOTE 2 In some applications it is necessary to certify the architecture. Certification confirms that the architectural intent is met, the architectural vision and key concepts are correctly implemented, and stakeholder concerns are properly addressed. It also gives essential feedback to the Architecture Definition process to help in the learning process and to help ensure that future iterations of architecture better address stakeholder concerns. 3) Maintain concordance and completeness of the architectural entities and their architectural characteristics. NOTE The entities to be checked are not only technical. These are also, for example, legal, economical, organizational and operational entities that are normally part of stakeholder requirements and concerns. 4) Organize, assess and control evolution of the architecture models and views. 5) Maintain the architecture definition and evaluation strategy.  NOTE This includes updating the architecture based upon technological, implementation, operational experiences, as well as the management of external and internal interfaces that are defined at this level of system decomposition. 6) Maintain traceability of the architecture. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the architecture entities (models, views, and viewpoints) to the requirements (including  allocated, decomposed, and derived), interface definitions, analysis results, and verification methods or techniques.  If possible, traceability is also maintained between the architecture entities and the stakeholder concerns.   7) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Architecture Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. 6.4.5 Design definition process 6.4.5.1 Purpose The purpose of the Design Definition process is to provide sufficient detailed data and information about the system and its elements to enable the implementation consistent with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture. NOTE 1 The Architecture Definition process, supports identification of stakeholders and their concerns. Through the use of the process, insights are gained into the relation between the requirements specified for the system and the emergent properties and behaviors of the system that arise from the interactions and relations between the system elements. The Design Definition process, on the other hand, is driven by requirements that have been vetted through the architecture and more detailed analyses of feasibility. Architecture focuses on suitability, viability, and desirability, whereas design focuses on compatibility with technologies and other design elements and feasibility of construction and integration. An effective architecture is as design-agnostic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility in the design trade space. NOTE 2 Design definition considers any applicable technologies and their contribution to the system solution. Design provides the ‘implement-to’ level of the definition, such as drawings and detailed design descriptions. NOTE 3 This process provides feedback to the system architecture to consolidate or confirm the allocation, partitioning and alignment of architectural entities to system elements that compose the system. 6.4.5.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Design Definition process: a) Design characteristics of each system element are defined. b) System requirements are allocated to system elements. c) Design enablers necessary for design definition are selected or defined.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Determine technologies required for each system element composing the system. NOTE Several technologies are sometimes used for a given system element (e.g., mechanics, electronics, software, operator roles, etc.). 2) Determine the necessary design characteristics types. NOTE For each technology the necessary design characteristics types (e.g., detailed patterns, structures, size, volume, gauge, template, etc.) are defined.  Design characteristics include security considerations such as the principle of least privilege, layered defenses, restricted access to system services, and other considerations to minimize and defend the system attack surface. 3) Define principles for evolution of the design. NOTE This includes defining periodic assessment of the design characteristics in case of evolution of the system and of its architecture as well as forecasting potential obsolescence of system elements and technologies, their replacement by others over time in the system life cycle, and the consequences for the design definition. 4) Define the design definition strategy. 5) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support design definition. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for design definition include tools for collaboration and design development, and design reuse repositories (for design patterns, design artifacts, design standards, etc.). 6) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Establish design characteristics and design enablers related to each system element. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Allocate system requirements to system elements. NOTE Some of the system requirements may have already been allocated to system elements during architecture definition. The purpose of this task is to complete the allocation to the extent necessary to address all system requirements. 2) Transform architectural characteristics into design characteristics. NOTE This task transforms each architectural characteristic related to architectural entities assigned to the system element into design characteristics (dimensions, shapes, materials, critical quality characteristics, data processing Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  63 structures, etc.) using adequate representation such as drawings, diagrams, models, architectures, tables of metrics and their values, etc.; every data is associated with detailed acceptable margins for implementation (if relevant at this step). 3) Define the necessary design enablers.  NOTE This task defines and/or selects the necessary design enablers such as models, equations, algorithms, calculations, formal expressions and values of parameters, patterns, heuristics, etc. that are associated to design characteristics.  Compatibility, affordability, security, and other critical properties in the context of their planned operational environment are considerations during the definition of necessary design enablers.  ISO 9241-210 provides human centered design/ergonomic design guidelines. 4) Examine design alternatives. NOTE Assess the feasibility of design characteristics and perform trades in the architecture or requirements when design characteristics cannot be implemented.  5) Refine or define the interfaces between the system elements and with external entities. NOTE Interfaces are identified and defined in the Architecture Definition process to the level or extent needed for the architecture intent and understanding.  They are refined in Design Definition process based on the design characteristics, interfaces and interactions of the system element with other system elements composing the system and with external entities. Additional interfaces might need to be identified and defined that were not addressed in the architecture definition.   6) Establish the design artifacts. NOTE This task formalizes the design characteristics of the system element through dedicated artifacts depending on the implementation technology. Examples of artifacts include data sheets (electronics), databases (software), documents (operator role), and exportable data files (mechanics).  c) Assess alternatives for obtaining system elements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify any candidate Non-Developmental-Items (NDI) that may be considered for use. NOTE This includes COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf), reuse of a previous design, or acquirer provided items. 2) Assess each candidate NDI and new design alternative against criteria developed from expected design characteristics or system element requirements to determine suitability for the intended application. 3) Determine the preferred alternative among any candidate NDI solutions and new design alternatives for a system element. NOTE The System Analysis process is used for analyses or assessments, as well as the Decision Management process to perform the selection. d) Manage the design. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Map design characteristics up to the system elements. NOTE 1 This task consists of establishing traceability between the detailed design characteristics and the architectural entities of the system architecture. NOTE 2 This facilitates providing feedback to the Architecture Definition process to possibly modify the physical arrangement of system elements in order to obtain architectural characteristics (e.g., modularity, usability, inter-operability, safeguard, etc.) as expected for the parent system architecture to meet stakeholder concerns. 2) Capture design and rationale  NOTE 1 Rationale includes information about major implementation options and enablers. NOTE 2 The Verification and Validation processes are invoked to verify and validate each detailed design characteristic and implementation option.

NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the design characteristics and the architectural entities, identified interfaces, analysis results, verification methods or techniques, and system element requirements. 4) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Design Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. 6.4.6 System analysis process 6.4.6.1 Purpose The purpose of the System Analysis process is to provide a rigorous basis of data and information for technical understanding to aid decision-making across the life cycle.   The System Analysis process applies to the development of inputs needed for any technical assessment.  It can provide confidence in the utility and integrity of system requirements, architecture, and design. System analysis covers a wide range of differing analytic functions, levels of complexity, and levels of rigor. It includes mathematical analysis, modeling, simulation, experimentation, and other techniques to analyze technical performance, system behavior, feasibility, affordability, critical quality characteristics, technical risks, life cycle costs, and to perform sensitivity analysis of the potential range of values for parameters across all life cycle stages.  It is used for a wide range of analytical needs concerning operational concepts, determination of requirement values, resolution of requirements conflicts, assessment of alternative architectures or system elements, and evaluation of engineering strategies (integration, verification, validation, and maintenance). Formality and rigor of the analysis will depend on the criticality of the information need or work product supported, the amount of information/data available, the size of the project, and the schedule for the results.  NOTE This process is often used in conjunction with the Decision Management process. 6.4.6.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the System Analysis process: a) System analyses needed are identified.  b) System analysis assumptions and results are validated. c) System analysis results are provided for decisions.  d) Any enabling systems or services needed for system analysis are available.  e) Traceability of the system analysis results is established. 6.4.6.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the System Analysis process. a) Prepare for system analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the problem or question that requires system analysis.  NOTE This includes technical, functional, and non-functional objectives of the analysis.  Non-functional objectives include critical quality characteristics, various properties, technology maturity, manufacturing maturity, technical risks, etc.  The problem statement or question to be answered by the analysis is essential to establish the objectives of the analysis and the expectations and utility of the results. 2) Identify the stakeholders of the system analysis.

NOTE The necessary level of fidelity (accuracy or precision) is a factor in determining the appropriate level of rigor.   4) Select the system analysis methods. NOTE The methods are chosen based on time, cost, fidelity, technical drivers, and criticality of analysis.  Analysis methods have a wide range of levels of rigor and include expert judgment, “back of the envelope” calculation, spreadsheet computations, historical data and trend analysis, engineering models, simulation, visualization, and prototyping. Due to cost and schedule constraints, most systems only perform system analysis for critical characteristics.  5) Define the system analysis strategy. 6) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support system analysis.  NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. The system analysis enabling systems include the tools, relevant models, and potential data repositories needed to support the analysis. The methods chosen will be a major factor in determining what tools are appropriate to support the analysis.  This also includes determining the availability of relevant models and data.   7) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 8) Collect the data and inputs needed for the analysis.  b) Perform system analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify and validate assumptions.  2) Apply the selected analysis methods to perform the required system analysis. 3) Review the analysis results for quality and validity.   NOTE The results are coordinated with associated analyses that have been previously completed. 4) Establish conclusions and recommendations.   NOTE The appropriate subject matter experts and stakeholders are identified and engaged in this task.  5) Record the results of the system analysis, c) Manage system analysis.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Maintain traceability of system analysis results.  NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the system analysis results and any system definition item for which the analysis is supporting a decision or providing rationale (e.g., system requirement values, architecture alternatives). This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 2) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (System Analysis) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the analysis results or reports are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.7 Implementation process 6.4.7.1 Purpose The purpose of the Implementation process is to realize a specified system element.

This process results in a system element that satisfies specified system requirements (including allocated and derived requirements), architecture, and design.  NOTE This applies to both a single element (concept and development stage) and production run (as in production stage).  It also can apply in the resolution of changes needed in the Support stage. 6.4.7.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Implementation process: a) Implementation constraints that influence the requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) A system element is realized. c) A system element is packaged or stored.  d) Any enabling systems or services needed for implementation are available. e) Traceability is established. 6.4.7.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Implementation process. a) Prepare for implementation.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define an implementation strategy. NOTE 1 Implementation strategies include build new, acquire new, or re-use existing elements (with or without modification),  If the strategy is reuse, then the project will need to determine the level, source, and suitability of the reused system elements. The implementation strategy includes implementation procedures, fabrication processes, tools and equipment, implementation tolerances and verification uncertainties. In the case of repeated system element implementation (e.g., mass production, replacement system elements) the implementation procedures and fabrication processes are defined to achieve consistent and repeatable producibility.  NOTE 2 The implementation strategy often invokes the Agreement processes, or requires enabling systems and services that include specialized life cycle development and support environments. 2) Identify constraints from the implementation strategy and implementation technology on the system requirements, architecture characteristics, design characteristics, or implementation techniques.  NOTE This includes current or anticipated limitations of the chosen implementation technology, acquirer furnished materials or system elements for adaptation and limitations resulting from the use of required implementation enabling systems. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support implementation. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services, and materials to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the integration enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Perform implementation.  This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Throughout the Implementation process the Verification process is used to objectively confirm the system element's conformance to requirements and the product's quality characteristics.

NOTE This is done using the implementation enabling systems and specified resources. Realizing system elements may include developing or purchasing them.  Adaptation includes configuration of system elements that are reused or modified.  Realization or adaptation is conducted with regard to standards that govern applicable safety, security, privacy and environmental guidelines or legislation and the practices of the relevant implementation technology.  i) Hardware  Hardware elements are either acquired or fabricated.  Hardware elements are fabricated using applicable techniques relevant to the physical implementation technology and materials selected.  As appropriate, hardware elements are verified for conformance to specified system requirements and critical quality characteristics. ii) Software  System elements realized in software are either acquired or developed.  As appropriate, these elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and design criteria. ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 applies to system elements realized in software. iii) Services Service elements include a set of services to be provided.  As appropriate, service elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and service criteria. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), applies to system elements realized in services. iv) Utilization and Support Resources Other system elements include utilization and support resources such as operational procedures, maintenance procedures, user training, etc.  As appropriate, utilization and support resource elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and operational concept. 2) Package and store the system element. NOTE Contain the system element in order to achieve continuance of its characteristics.  Conveyance and storage, and their durations, influence the specified containment. Final configuration and product information is captured by the Configuration Mgt and Information Mgt processes when the system element is stored. 3) Record objective evidence that the system element meets system requirements.  NOTE Evidence is provided in accordance with supply agreements, legislation and organization policy.  Evidence includes element modifications made due to processing changes or any non-conformances found during the Verification and Validation Processes. The objective evidence is part of the system element's as-implemented configuration baseline established through the Configuration Management process and includes the results of unit testing, analysis, inspections, walk-through events, demonstrations, product or technical reviews, or other verification exercises. c) Manage results of implementation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record implementation results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the implementation strategy, the implementation enabling systems, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Maintain traceability of the implemented system elements.   NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the implemented system elements and the system architecture, design, and system requirements including interface requirements and definitions that are necessary for implementation.

NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Implementation) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the system elements are typical information items that are baselined. 6.4.8 Integration process 6.4.8.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Integration process is to synthesize a set of system elements into a realized system (product or service) that satisfies system requirements, architecture, and design. This process assembles the implemented system elements. Interfaces are identified and activated to enable interoperation of the system elements as intended. This process integrates the enabling systems with the system-of-interest to facilitate interoperation. NOTE 1 For a given level of the system hierarchy, this process iteratively combines implemented system elements to form complete or partial system configurations in order to build a product or service.  It is used recursively for successive levels of the system hierarchy.  NOTE 2 The interfaces are defined by the Architecture Definition and Design Definition processes. This process coordinates with these other processes and checks to make sure the interface definitions are adequate and that they take into account the integration needs.   6.4.8.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Integration process: a) Integration constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or design, including interfaces, are identified.  b) Approach and checkpoints for the correct operation of the assembled interfaces and system functions are defined. c) Any enabling systems or services needed for integration are available. d) A system composed of implemented system elements is integrated. e) The interfaces between the implemented system elements that compose the system are checked. f) The interfaces between the system and the external environment are checked. g) Integration results and anomalies are identified.  h) Traceability of the integrated system elements is established. 6.4.8.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Integration process. a) Prepare for integration. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify and define check points for the correct operation and integrity of the assembled interfaces and the selected system functions.   NOTE 1 Detailed verification of the interfaces is performed using the Verification process.  NOTE 2 Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 and the ISO/IEC 27000 series for information on assurance, integrity, and security.  Consider anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper, system and software assurance and interoperability elements when identifying and defining checkpoints.

NOTE 2 This strategy often provides for verification against a sequence of progressively more complete system element configurations. It is dependent on system element availability and is consistent with a fault isolation and diagnosis strategy. Wherever possible, an integrated configuration includes its human operators. Successive applications of the Integration process and the Verification process, and when appropriate the Validation process, are repeated for systems at successive levels until the system-of-interest has been realized. 3) Identify and plan for  the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support integration. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for integration include the integration facilities, assembly equipment, training systems, discrepancy reporting systems, simulators, measurement devices, and facility security.  Changes needed for the enabling systems to support the integration tasks need to be identified and defined.  The need for these changes are provided to the stakeholders that govern the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services, and materials to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the integration enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 5) Identify system constraints from integration to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture or design. NOTE This includes requirements such as accessibility, safety for integrators, required interconnections for sets of implemented system elements and for enablers, and interface constraints.   b) Perform integration - Successively integrate system element configurations until the complete system is synthesized. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain implemented system elements in accordance with agreed schedules. NOTE The implemented system elements are received from suppliers, the acquirer, or withdrawn from storage. System elements are handled in accordance with relevant health, safety, security and privacy considerations.  As part of the acceptance of the implemented system elements, each element is checked to help ensure it has been verified and validated against acceptance criteria specified in an agreement. The delivered configuration, conformance, compatibility of interfaces, the presence of mandatory information items are checked. Implemented system elements that do not pass verification are identified as such and handled in accordance with defined procedures. 2) Assemble the implemented system elements. NOTE The assembly is performed to achieve system element configuration (complete or partial) connecting the implemented system elements as prescribed in the integration strategy, using the defined assembly procedures, interface control descriptions, and the related integration enabling systems.   3) Perform check of the interfaces, selected functions, and critical quality characteristics. NOTE This is performed to help ensure the operation of the interfaces (external and internal), functions, and quality characteristics.  The interfaces are checked using the Verification process against the interface requirements. c) Manage results of integration. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record integration results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the integration strategy, the integration enabling systems, execution of the integration or incorrect system or element definition. Where inconsistencies exist at the interface between the system, its specified operational environment and any systems that enable the utilization stage, the deviations lead to corrective actions or requirement changes.  The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Maintain traceability of the integrated system elements.

This process (Integration) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the integration strategy is a typical information item that is baselined. 6.4.9 Verification process  6.4.9.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system or system element fulfils its specified requirements and characteristics. The Verification process identifies the anomalies (errors, defects, or faults) in any information item (e.g., system requirements or architecture description), implemented system elements, or life cycle processes using appropriate methods, techniques, standards or rules. This process provides the necessary information to determine resolution of identified anomalies.  NOTE The Verification process determines that the ""product is built right"".  The Validation process determines that the ""right product is built"". 6.4.9.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Verification process: a) Constraints of verification that influence the requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for verification are available. c) The system or system element is verified. d) Data providing information for corrective actions is reported. e) Objective evidence that the realized system fulfils the requirements, architecture and design is provided.  f) Verification results and anomalies are identified. g) Traceability of the verified system elements is established. 6.4.9.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Verification process. a) Prepare for verification. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE This strategy generally focuses on minimizing cost and schedule, and/or risk, providing a balanced approach for confirming that the system or system element has been “built right”. 1) Identify the verification scope and corresponding verification actions. NOTE Scope includes requirements, architecture and design characteristics or other properties to be verified.  For each verification action, the strategy describes the system element or artifact to be verified (the actual system, or a model, a mock-up, a prototype, a procedure, a plan or other document), and the expected result, such as from its performance or conformance. Design characteristics include security implications of the design in the context of the planned operational environment and the achievement of critical quality characteristics. 2) Identify the constraints that potentially limit the feasibility of verification actions.

NOTE Verification methods or techniques include: inspection (including peer review), analysis (including modeling, simulation, and analogy/similarity), demonstration, or testing. The selection of verification methods or techniques are made according to the type of system, the objectives of the project, and the acceptable risks.  Selected methods are coordinated with relevant stakeholders to help ensure the verification approach is acceptable.  4) Define the verification strategy. NOTE 1 The definition includes trading off what will be verified (scope) against the constraints or limits, and deduces what verification actions to use.  Verification actions that are candidates for deletion are evaluated for the risks their withdrawal imposes.  The prioritized verification strategy encompasses the most appropriate verification method or technique for every verification action and the necessary verification enabling systems (simulators, test-benches, qualified personnel, location, facilities, etc.) according to selected verification methods or techniques. NOTE 2 The verification strategy and schedule are updated according to the progress of the project; in particular planned verification actions are redefined or rescheduled when unexpected events or system evolutions occur. 5) Identify system constraints from the verification strategy to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture, or design. NOTE This includes practical limitations of accuracy, uncertainty, repeatability that are imposed by the verification enablers, the associated measurement methods, the need for system integration, and the availability, accessibility and interconnection with enablers. 6) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support verification. NOTE Verification enabling systems include verification equipment, simulators, test automation tools, facilities, etc. 7) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used to support verification. NOTE The acquisition of the enabling systems can be done through various ways such as rental, procurement, development, reuse, subcontracting; usually the acquisition of the complete set of enablers is a mix of these ways. The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the verification enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Perform verification. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the verification procedures, each supporting one or a set of verification actions. NOTE The procedures identify the purpose of the verification with success criteria (expected results), the verification technique to be applied, the necessary enabling systems (facilities, equipment, etc.), and the environmental conditions to perform each verification procedure (resources, qualified personnel, etc.). 2) Perform the verification procedures. NOTE Verification, in accordance with the verification strategy, occurs at the appropriate time in the schedule. Verification activities are performed at the appropriate point the system life cycle in the defined environment, with defined enabling systems and resources. The performance of a verification action consists of capturing a result from the execution of the verification procedure; comparing the obtained result with the expected result; and deducing a degree of correctness of the submitted element. c) Manage results of verification. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record verification results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE 1 This includes anomalies due to the verification strategy, the verification enabling systems, execution of the verification, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned.  NOTE 2 The evaluation of verification results in the Project Assessment and Control Process and follow-up corrective action can vary greatly depending on the purpose of the verification.

The scope of qualification depends on the system-of-interest and its environment. For example, in some environments regulatory requirements include certification of operators, whereas in others there is no certification requirement.  A training mode of the operational system sometimes impacts service availability.  b) Perform operation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Use the system in its intended operational environment.  NOTE The Operation Strategy guides the system usage.  Where agreed, continuous service capacity and quality is maintained when the system replaces an existing system that is being retired.  During a specified period of changeover or concurrent operation, the transfer of services is managed so that continuing conformance to persistent stakeholder needs is achieved. 2) Apply materials and other resources, as required, to operate the system and sustain its services. NOTE This includes energy sources for hardware and provisions for operators. 3) Monitor system operation. NOTE 1 This includes:  i) Managing adherence to the operation strategy. ii) Assuring that the system is operated in a safe manner and compliant with legislated guidelines concerning occupational safety and environmental protection.

NOTE 2 Monitoring the system includes reviewing that the performance is within established thresholds, periodic instrument readings are acceptable, and service and response times are acceptable.  Operator feedback and suggestions are useful input for improving system operational performance. NOTE 3 Cost of operation is also monitored against objectives and constraints, and to identify potential improvements. 4) Identify and record when system service performance is not within acceptable parameters. NOTE The system sometimes exhibits unacceptable performance when system elements implemented in hardware have exceeded their useful life or the system’s operational environment affects the operating and maintenance personnel (including staff turnover, operator stress and fatigue). 5) Perform system contingency operations, if necessary.  NOTE This includes operating the system in a degraded mode, performing back-out and restore operation, system shutdown, implementation of work-around procedures to restore operation, or other modes for special conditions.  If needed, the operator performs steps necessary to enter into contingency operations and possibly power down the system.  Contingency operations are performed in accordance with pre-established procedures for such an event. Often these procedures are accompanied by a continuity plan.   c) Manage results of operation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record  results of operation and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the operation strategy, the operation enabling systems, execution of the operation, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Record operational incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE 1 Performing problem resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. Any actual changes to the requirements, architecture, design, or system elements are done within other Technical Processes. NOTE 2 If an incident is experienced during operation, the operator records the incident and performs actions prescribed in validated operating procedures to restore normal operations.  3) Maintain traceability of the Operations elements. NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the Operations elements and the business or mission needs, operational concept, concept of operations, and stakeholder requirements. 4) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Operation) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. d) Support the customer. This activity consists of the following task: 1) Provide assistance and consultation to the customers as requested.   NOTE Assistance and consultation includes the providing of or providing recommended sources for training, documentation, vulnerability resolution, anti-counterfeit reporting, and other support services supporting effective use of the product. 2) Record and monitor requests and subsequent actions for support. 3) Determine the degree to which delivered system services satisfy the needs of the customers.

Wherever possible the benefit of such action is agreed with stakeholders or their representatives.  The customer satisfaction data also serves as an input to the Quality Management process.  6.4.13 Maintenance process 6.4.13.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Maintenance process is to sustain the capability of the system to provide a service.   This process monitors the system’s capability to deliver services, records incidents for analysis, takes corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive actions and confirms restored capability. 6.4.13.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Maintenance process: a) Maintenance constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for maintenance are available. c) Replacement, repaired, or revised system elements are made available. d) The need for changes to address corrective, perfective, or adaptive maintenance is reported. e) Failure and lifetime data, including associated costs, is determined. 6.4.13.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Maintenance process. a) Prepare for maintenance.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a maintenance strategy. NOTE 1 The maintenance strategy, also known as the maintenance concept, defines the approaches, schedules, resources, and specific considerations required to perform corrective and preventive maintenance in conformance with operational availability requirements.  It generally includes: i) The corrective and preventive maintenance strategy to sustain service in the operational environment in order to achieve customer satisfaction. ii) The scheduled preventive maintenance actions that reduce the likelihood of system failure without undue loss of services or impact on normal operations, (e.g., suspension or restriction of the services). iii) The logistics strategy throughout the life cycle, including acquisition logistics (helps ensure supportability implications are considered early during the Development stage) and operations logistics (helps ensure that the necessary material and resources, in the right quantity and quality, are available at the right place and time throughout the Utilization and Support Stages). iv) The number and type of replacement system elements to be stored, their storage locations and conditions, their anticipated replacement rate, and their storage life and renewal frequency. v) Approach to assure that counterfeit system elements are not introduced into the system. vi) The skill and personnel levels required to effect repairs, replacements, and restoration accounting for maintenance staff requirements and any relevant legislation regarding health and safety, security and the environment. vii) Measures for maintenance that will provide insight into performance levels, effectiveness, and efficiency.

It provides a systematic approach to defining a routine maintenance program composed of cost-effective tasks that preserve important functions.  SAE JA1011:2009, Evaluation Criteria for Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) Processes, provides detailed information. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM/CBM+) is a strategy to improve system reliability by reducing the amount of time the system is unavailable while conducting routine or corrective maintenance.   NOTE 3 In most cases, the extension of capability, mid-life upgrade, or evolution of legacy systems becomes a new system development project that will apply the set of processes within an appropriate life cycle as applicable. 2) Identify system constraints from maintenance to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture, or design.   NOTE These often result from the need to 1) re-use existing maintenance enabling systems; 2) re-use existing holdings of replaceable system element and accommodate re-supply limitations; 3) conduct maintenance in specific locations or environments. 3) Identify trades such that the system and associated maintenance and logistics actions results in a solution that is affordable, operable, supportable, and sustainable. NOTE The System Analysis and Decision Management processes are used to perform the assessments and trade decisions. 4) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support maintenance. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 5) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the maintenance enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Perform maintenance.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review incident and problem reports to identify future corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive maintenance needs. 2) Record maintenance incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE 1 If an incident is experienced during maintenance, the maintenance staff records the incident and performs actions prescribed in validated maintenance procedures.   NOTE 2 Performing maintenance problem identification and resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. 3) Implement the procedures for correction of random faults or scheduled replacement of system elements. NOTE For random system failures, the fault is isolated down to the planned level of system element replacement, repair, revision, or reconfiguration. Then the corrective actions for the system element are performed and correct system performance is verified.  Actions are recorded in order to estimate the useful life of degradable system elements.   4) Upon encountering random faults that cause a system failure, deploy actions to restore the system to operational status.  NOTE Restoration to full operational status may not be possible until the cause of the fault is corrected.  In that case, the system is restored to a degraded mode consistent with the contingency planning.   5) Perform preventive maintenance by replacing or servicing system elements prior to failure, according to planned schedules and maintenance procedures. 6) Perform failure identification actions when a non-compliance has occurred in the system.

NOTE Adaptive and perfective maintenance actions usually involve change to the system requirements, architecture or design.  It may be necessary to establish a new project to modify the existing system.  If so, the Portfolio Management process may be the starting point to initiate the work from the Development stage.  c) Perform logistics support.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Perform acquisition logistics. NOTE Acquisition Logistics considerations are included in the agreement resulting from the Agreement processes. Supportability implications are also considered during the Development stage. This includes performing analysis to determine whether it is more cost effective to influence the initial design of the system or to plan for spare parts and repairs during utilization.  These decisions are often constrained by availability requirements and impact the supply chain management.  Acquisition logistics considers the supportability needs of the system concurrently with the definition of the system requirements. 2) Perform operational logistics. NOTE Operational logistics is the concurrent tuning of both the SOI and enabling systems throughout the operational life to help ensure effective and efficient delivery of system functions.  It also includes taking the steps necessary to help ensure that the necessary material and resources, in the right quantity and quality, are available at the right place and time.   3) Implement any packaging, handling, storage and transportation needed during the life cycle. NOTE This includes packaging, handling, storage and transportation for the system, system elements, and the required replacement system elements.  This is often required to support the objectives of the Integration and Transition processes. 4) Confirm that logistics actions satisfy the required replenishment levels so that stored system elements meet repair rates and planned schedules. NOTE Monitor the quality and availability of spares, their transportation and their continued integrity during storage.  Acquire, train and accredit, as necessary, personnel to maintain operator numbers and skills. 5) Confirm that logistics actions include supportability requirements that are planned, resourced, and implemented. NOTE The logistics actions enable the system to achieve operational readiness.  The actions include staffing, supply support, support equipment, technical data needs (manuals, instructions, lists, etc.), training support, equipment/computing resource support, and facilities.  d) Manage results of maintenance and logistics. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record maintenance and logistics results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the maintenance strategy, the maintenance enabling systems, execution of the maintenance and logistics, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Record operational incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE Performing problem resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. Any actual changes to the requirements, architecture, design, or system elements are done within other Technical Processes. 3) Identify and record trends of incidents, problems, and maintenance and logistics actions. NOTE 1 This is used to inform operations and maintenance personnel, and other projects that are creating or utilizing similar system entities. NOTE 2 Incident and problem reporting, including resulting action taken, is tracked through Incident and process Management activity of the Quality Assurance process.

NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the maintenance actions and the system elements and life cycle artifacts. 5) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Maintenance) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. Examples include maintenance plans and life cycle support plans. 6) Monitor customer satisfaction with system and maintenance support. NOTE The customer satisfaction data is used in the Quality Management process. ISO 10004:2012 contains guidelines for monitoring and measuring customer satisfaction. 6.4.14 Disposal process 6.4.14.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Disposal process is to end the existence of a system element or system for a specified intended use, appropriately handle replaced or retired elements, and to properly attend to identified critical disposal needs (e.g., per an agreement, per organizational policy, or for environmental, legal, safety, security aspects). This process deactivates, disassembles and removes the system or any of its system elements from the specific use.  It addresses any waste products, consigning them to a final condition and returning the environment to its original or an acceptable condition.  The waste products can be in-process resulting during any life cycle stage, e.g., waste materials during fabrication.  This process destroys, stores or reclaims system elements and waste products in an environmentally sound manner, in accordance with legislation, agreements, organizational constraints and stakeholder requirements.  Disposal includes preventing expired, non-reusable, or inadequate elements from getting back into the supply chain.  Where required, it maintains records in order that the health of operators and users, and the safety of the environment, can be monitored.  When part of the system will continue to be in use in a modified form, the Disposal process helps ensure the proper handling of the portion being retired.  NOTE The Disposal process is intended to be applicable throughout the life cycle of the system, including disposing prototypes during the Concept and Development stages, dealing with waste during the Production stage, and decommissioning elements from modifications during the Utilization and Support stages.  6.4.14.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Disposal process: a) Disposal constraints are provided as inputs to requirements, architecture, design, and implementation. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for disposal are available. c) The system elements or waste products are destroyed, stored, reclaimed or recycled in accordance with safety and security requirements. d) The environment is returned to its original or an agreed state. e) Records of disposal actions and analysis are available. 6.4.14.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Disposal process. a) Prepare for disposal.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a disposal strategy for the system, to include each system element and any resulting waste products.

NOTE This includes issues of disassembly, including their associated enabling systems, access to and availability of storage locations and available skill levels. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support disposal. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the disposal enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 5) Specify containment facilities, storage locations, inspection criteria and storage periods, if the system is to be stored. 6) Define preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed or reused from re-entering the supply chain. b) Perform disposal.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Deactivate the system or system element to prepare it for removal. NOTE Interfaces to other systems are considered, e.g., power or fuel are disconnected in accordance with disassembly instructions, and relevant health, safety, security and privacy legislation. When the System-of-Interest is being modified for technology or capability upgrades, only the impacted system elements are deactivated and removed.  This can apply to a prototype of the System-of-Interest during the Concept or Development stage,  2) Remove the system, system element, or waste material from use or production for appropriate disposition and action.  NOTE The disposition includes reuse, recycling, reconditioning, overhaul, or destruction.  The disposition and subsequent actions are conducted in accordance with relevant safety, security, privacy and environmental standards, directives and laws.  Elements of the system that have useful life remaining, either in their current condition or following overhaul or modification, are transferred to other systems-of-interest or organizations.  Where appropriate, recondition system elements to extend their useful life.  Reallocate, redeploy or retire operators.  When the element is expired, non-reusable, or inadequate, it is necessary to prevent the elements from getting back into the supply chain.  This task includes the removal of waste material from production or other stages.  3) Withdraw impacted operating staff from the system or system element and record relevant operating knowledge. NOTE This is conducted in accordance with relevant safety, security, privacy and environmental standards, directives and laws. Act to safeguard and secure knowledge and skills possessed by operators.  Refer to knowledge management process. 4) Disassemble the system or system element into manageable elements to facilitate its removal for reuse, recycling, reconditioning, overhaul, archiving or destruction.

NOTE 1 Tailoring is not a requirement for conformance to the standard. In fact, tailoring is not permitted if a claim of ""full conformance"" is to be made. If a claim of ""tailored conformance"" is made, then this process is applied to perform the tailoring. NOTE 2 Additional guidance for tailoring can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes. A.2 Tailoring process A.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Tailoring process is to adapt the processes of this International Standard to satisfy particular circumstances or factors that: a) Surround an organization that is employing this International Standard in an agreement; b) Influence a project that is required to meet an agreement in which this International Standard is referenced; c) Reflect the needs of an organization in order to supply products or services. A.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Tailoring process: a) Modified or new life cycle processes are defined to achieve the purposes and outcomes of a life cycle model. A.2.3 Activities and tasks If this International Standard is tailored, then the organization or project shall implement the following tasks in accordance with applicable policies and procedures with respect to the Tailoring process, as required. a) Identify and record the circumstances that influence tailoring. These influences include, but are not limited to: 1) stability of, and variety in, operational environments; 2) risks, commercial or performance, to the concern of interested parties; 3) novelty, size and complexity; 4) starting date and duration of utilization; 5) integrity issues such as safety, security, privacy, usability, availability; 6) emerging technology opportunities; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  87 7) profile of budget and organizational resources available; 8) availability of the services of enabling systems; 9) roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities in the overall life cycle of the system; 10) the need to conform to other standards. b) In the case of properties critical to the system, take due account of the life cycle structures recommended or mandated by standards relevant to the dimension of the criticality. c) Obtain input from parties affected by the tailoring decisions.  This includes, but may not be limited to: 1) the system stakeholders; 2) the interested parties to an agreement made by the organization; 3) the contributing organizational functions. d) Make tailoring decisions in accordance with the Decision Management process to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the selected life cycle model. NOTE 1 Organizations establish standard life cycle models as a part of the Life Cycle Model Management process. It is sometimes appropriate for an organization to tailor processes of this International Standard in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a life cycle model to be established. NOTE 2 Projects select an organizationally-established life cycle model for the project as a part of the Project Planning process. It is sometimes appropriate to tailor organizationally adopted processes to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of the selected life cycle model. NOTE 3 In cases where projects are directly applying this International Standard, it is sometimes appropriate to tailor processes of this International Standard in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a suitable life cycle model. e) Select the life cycle processes that require tailoring and delete selected outcomes, activities, or tasks. NOTE 1 Irrespective of tailoring, organizations and projects are always permitted to implement processes that achieve additional outcomes or implement additional activities and tasks beyond those required for conformance to this standard.  NOTE 2 An organization or project sometimes encounter a situation where there is the desire to modify a provision of this International Standard. Modification is to be avoided because of unanticipated consequences on other processes, outcomes, activities or tasks. If necessary, modification is performed by deleting the provision (making the appropriate claim of tailored conformance) and, with careful consideration of consequences, implementing a process that achieves additional outcomes or performs additional activities and tasks beyond those of the tailored standard.

model for assessment purposes C.1 Introduction It is understood that some users of this International Standard may desire to assess the implemented processes in accordance with ISO/IEC 15504-2. This annex provides a Process Reference Model suitable for use in conjunction with that standard. The Process Reference Model is composed of the processes in the body of this International Standard, including the name, statement of purpose, and statement of outcomes for each process.  Clause C.3 identifies the processes in the process reference model and the clauses in which they are defined.  C.2 Conformance with ISO/IEC 15504-2 C.2.1 General ISO/IEC 15504-2 subclause 6.2 places requirements on process reference models suitable for assessment by that standard. The following sections quote the requirements for process reference models and describe how these are met by this international standard. In each of the following subclauses the italicized text quotes the requirement from the text of ISO/IEC 15504-2 and the non-italicized (upright) text describes the manner in which the requirement is satisfied in this International Standard.  C.2.2 Requirements for process reference models A Process Reference Model shall contain: a) A declaration of the domain of the Process Reference Model.

The process descriptions in the Process Reference Model incorporate a statement of the purpose of the process, which describes at a high level the overall objectives of performing the process, together with the set of outcomes that demonstrates successful achievement of the process purpose. These process descriptions shall meet the following requirements: a) a process shall be described in terms of its purpose and outcomes; b) in any process description the set of process outcomes shall be necessary and sufficient to achieve the purpose of the process; c) process descriptions shall be such that no aspects of the Measurement Framework as described in Clause 5 of [ISO/IEC 15504-2] beyond level 1 are contained or implied. An outcome statement describes one of the following:  Production of an artifact;  A significant change of state;  Meeting of specified constraints, e.g., requirements, goals, and objectives. These requirements are met by the process descriptions in this annex. Some outcomes might be interpreted as contributing to levels of capability above level 1. However, conforming implementation of the relevant processes does not require achievement of these higher levels of capability. C.3 The process reference model The Process Reference Model (PRM) is composed of the statement of purpose and outcomes of each of the processes included in Clause 6 of this International Standard.  The PRM for the system life cycle is composed of the set of processes in Figure 4.

Concepts of continual process improvement and capability assessment are now well established and recognized, and are being standardized in the ISO/IEC 15504 series of standards. The Process Reference Models in Annex C of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 are intended to be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 15504 series of standards for capability assessment of the life cycle processes. Capability determination of processes requires that the process descriptions include a clear statement of the purpose of the process and a description of the expected outcomes. Consistent implementation of the processes is aided by having activities, tasks, and implementation notes defined. Thus, the life cycle processes in both life cycle standards have adopted common process constructs, as defined in Clause D.2, Process constructs and their usage, and is consistent with the process definition guidance contained in ISO/IEC TR 24774.  D.2 Process constructs and their usage The process descriptions in this International Standard follow clearly defined rules. Firstly, they were grouped in a logical fashion. Those groupings are dictated by:  Logical relations among the processes  Responsibility for execution of the processes This International Standard groups the activities that may be performed during the life cycle of the system into four Process Groups. The top level description of these groups can be found in subclause 5.6. Each life cycle process within those groups is described in terms of its purpose and desired outcomes and lists the activities and tasks that need to be performed to achieve those outcomes.  a) Agreement Processes – two processes (subclause 6.1) b) Organizational Project-Enabling Processes – six processes (subclause 6.2) c) Technical Management Processes  – eight processes (subclause 6.3) d) Technical Processes – fourteen processes (subclause 6.4) Consistent application of process description rules allows for the normalized clause numbering.  Within this International Standard a subclause numbered as 6.x denotes a process group and 6.x.y denotes a process within that group. Subclauses numbered as 6.x.y.1 describe the purpose of a process, subclauses numbered 6.x.y.2 describe the outcomes of a process, and subclauses numbered as 6.x.y.3 describe the activities and tasks of a process.  Figure D.1 is a UML representation of process constructs used in this International Standard and in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.

For such interests, a process view can be developed to organize processes, activities, and tasks selected from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 to provide a focus to their particular concern in a manner that cuts across all or parts of the life cycle. This annex provides a process viewpoint that may be used to define process views in these instances. E.2 The process view concept There may be cases where a unified focus is needed for activities and tasks that are selected from disparate processes to provide visibility to a significant concept or thread that cuts across the processes employed across the life cycle. It is useful to advise users of the standards how to identify and define these activities for their use, even though they cannot locate a single process that addresses their specific concern. For this purpose, the concept of a process view has been formulated. Like a process, the description of a process view includes a statement of purpose and outcomes. Unlike a process, the description of a process view does not include activities and tasks. Instead, the description includes guidance explaining how the outcomes can be achieved by employing the activities and tasks of the various processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. Process views can be constructed using the process viewpoint template found in E.3. E.3 Process viewpoint A process view conforms to a process viewpoint. The process viewpoint provided here can be used to create process views.   The process viewpoint is defined by:   its stakeholders: users of the standard;  the concerns it frames: the processes needed to reflect a particular engineering interest.  The contents of resulting process views should include:  process view name;  process view purpose;  process view outcomes; and  identification and description of the processes, activities and tasks that implement the process view, and references to the sources for these processes, activities and tasks in other standards. NOTE The requirements for documenting viewpoints are found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, subclause 5.4. This description is consistent with those requirements.

This example treats the cluster of interests, generally called specialty engineering, which includes but is not limited to such areas as availability, maintainability, reliability, safety, security, human factors, and usability.  Within ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, these ""ilities"" requirements are referred to as ""critical quality characteristics"". These characteristics determine how well the product meets its specified requirements in a specific area selected for focus.  NOTE This is a generalized instance of a process view that covers a broad set of functional and non-functional characteristics related to specialty engineering. It provides a broad view across the processes.  If a specific critical quality characteristic has a high priority relative to other characteristics, a specific process view could be created for that characteristic, including more detailed information and requirements.  Name: Specialty Engineering process View Purpose: The purpose of the Specialty Engineering process View is to provide objective evidence that the system achieves satisfactory levels of certain critical quality characteristics selected for special attention. Outcomes: a) Product critical quality characteristics are selected for special attention. b) Requirements for the achievement of the critical quality characteristics are defined. c) Measures for the requirements are selected and related to the desired critical quality characteristics. d) Approaches for achieving the desired critical quality characteristics are defined and implemented. e) The extent of achievement of the requirements is continually monitored. f) The extent of achievement of the critical quality characteristics are specified and developed. NOTE The outcomes permit the possibility that the desired critical quality characteristics cannot be directly measured but instead might be argued and inferred based on other product or process characteristics that can be measured. Processes, Activities and Tasks: This process view can be implemented using the following processes, activities, and tasks from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288: NOTE 1 ISO/IEC 25030, Software Engineering — Software product quality requirements and evaluation (SQuaRE) — Quality requirements, may be useful in specifying software product quality requirements.

Architecture and design activities in this version are split in two processes to reflect the different practices in the systems engineering community dealing with complex systems. As one example, an architecture might be followed by different designs for different systems in a product line. In this case it is important to perform these two processes in a separate manner. Furthermore, architecture is often done for other reasons than as the basis for design, such as, for example, to drive technology investments, to adjust corporate portfolio of projects, to guide a bid/no-bid decision, etc. The architecture of a system can be understood as a set of structured architectural entities and of their relationships, such as functions, function flows, interfaces, resource flow items, information/data elements, physical components, containers, nodes, links, communication resources, etc. These architectural entities may possess characteristics such as dimensions, environmental resilience, availability, robustness, execution efficiency, mission effectiveness, etc. F.2  Viewpoints, views and model kinds used in architecture The Architectural Definition process uses a variety of models, including the example models listed in the following section. (Traditional system engineering practice classifies some of these models as “logical models” or “physical models”, but the taxonomical distinction is unnecessary in the application of this International Standard.) A variety of views are used to represent how the system architecture addresses stakeholder concerns. Views are composed of models. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for definitions of architecture terms and additional detail on architecture concepts and models. F.3  Logical and physical models F.3.1 Functional model  A functional model of the system is a representation of a set of functions that defines the transformations of inputs into outputs performed by the system to achieve its mission or purpose. These functions are determined by how the system is expected to behave when used as intended. Consequently, every system function is associated with an interaction between the system and its environment. Functional, performance, non-functional, and constraint requirements are usually analyzed to determine functions and input-output flows. When functions are associated with system elements, the design definition process will need to determine if each system element has been sufficiently specified to build or buy it. If the system element must be further resolved in order to achieve this sufficiency then the functions associated with the system element will also need be further resolved and properly associated with the sub elements. Typically there are multiple ways to decompose the functions that contributes to the definition of multiple candidate architectures. F.3.2 Behavioral model A behavioral model is an arrangement of functions and interfaces (internal and external) that defines how the system or its elements act under conditions to sustain the operational scenarios, including the execution sequencing and concurrency, the conditions for behavioral change and the performance.  A behavioral model can be described with a set of inter-related scenarios. This includes identifying the behavioral elements (modes/states, transitions, trigger events, operational scenarios, etc.) through the life cycle.

This includes identifying temporal elements (duration, frequency, response time, triggers, timeout, stop conditions, etc.) from the operational concept and system requirements. F.3.4 Structural model A structural model of the system is a representation that shows the arrangement of elements with respect to each other and where necessary shows the interfaces between elements and with external entities. Such a model enables  consolidating or identifying physical interfaces between system elements in a level of the system hierarchy and between levels of the system hierarchy, as well as those with external entities to the concerned system (in its environment/context).  F.3.5 Mass model A mass model of the system is a representation showing the position of physical volumes of system elements or of their parts in the case these are geographically distributed. It could record the expected or actual mass properties to help determine such mass properties as centre of gravity and dynamic behavior of motion. It can also be used to help allocate total system mass to its elements. F.3.6 Layout model A layout model of the system is a representation of where the system elements are placed geographically against each other. In model railroading, a layout model is a diorama containing scale track for operating trains. An automobile layout describes where on the vehicle the engine and drive wheels are found. F.3.7 Network model A network model defines an arrangement of nodes and links to help understand how resources traverse from one node to another. Resources flowing in a network can be mass, energy, data, people, etc. A network model can be used to determine throughput, latency, congestion points, etc. A network model is sometimes modeled along with a protocol stack to understand how layers in a network interact vertically up and down the stack. F.3.8 Other model considerations Stakeholder life cycle concerns such as maintenance, evolution, disposal, potential changes of environment, or obsolescence management, and non-functional requirements, are addressed defining architectural characteristics such as modularity, relative independence, upgradeability, adaptation to several environments, level of effectiveness, reliability, robustness, scalability, or resistance to environmental conditions, etc.  Other necessary models could include some of these characteristics or other critical quality characteristics.  For example, a reliability model could drive the functional level of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA or FMECA) to help deduce potential architectural mitigations to minimize operational risks (mission loss, safety or security) related to critical concerns and functions. Determination of which models to use in system definition can be based on examination of stakeholder concerns. The models and the resulting views can be used to express how the system architecture and design addresses their concerns and to gain better understanding of their actual needs, wants and expectations.  Furthermore, models may be used in other life cycle processes besides architecture and design definition. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, architecture, design, analysis, verification and validation activities throughout the  life cycle.

A SoS brings together a set of systems for a task that none of the systems can accomplish on its own. Each constituent system keeps its own management, goals, and resources while coordinating within the SoS and adapting to meet SoS goals. In the context of terminology discussed in subclause 5.2.3 (as shown in Figure 3), the composite set of systems including the original SOI, enabling systems and interacting systems, together constitute an SoS. Where there are concerns that affect the composite set, the system of systems becomes the SOI, which is considered to satisfy some business or mission objective that cannot be satisfied by the individual constituent systems, or to understand emergent behavior of the combination. This annex addresses the application of system life cycle processes to such SoS. It describes general characteristics, the common types of SoS, and the implications throughout the life cycle. G.2 SoS characteristics and types SoS are characterized by managerial and operational independence of the constituent systems, which in many cases were developed and continue to support originally identified users concurrently with users of the SoS.  In other contexts, each constituent system itself is a SOI; its existence often predates the SoS, while its characteristics were originally engineered to meet the needs of their initial users. As constituents of the SoS, their consideration is expanded to encompass the larger needs of the SoS. This implies added complexity particularly when the systems continue to evolve independently of the SoS. The constituent systems also typically retain their original stakeholders and governance mechanisms, which limits alternatives to address the needs of the SoS. SoS have been characterized into four types based on the governance relationships between the constituent systems and the SoS (Figure G.1). The strongest governance relations apply to directed system of systems, where the SoS organization has authority over the constituent systems despite the fact that the constituent systems may not have originally been engineered to support the SoS.  Somewhat less control is afforded for acknowledged SoS, where allocated authority between the constituent systems and the systems of systems has an impact on application of some of the systems engineering processes.  In collaborative SoS, which lack system of systems authorities, application of systems engineering depends on cooperation among the constituent systems.  Virtual systems of systems are largely self organizing and offer much more limited opportunity for systems engineering of the SoS. Emergence is a key characteristic of SoS – the unanticipated effects at the systems of systems level attributed to the complex interaction dynamics of the constituent systems.  In SoS, constituent systems are intentionally considered in their combination, so as to obtain and analyze outcomes not possible to obtain with the systems alone.  The complexity of the constituent systems and the fact they may have been designed without regard to their role in the SoS, can result in new, unexpected behaviors.  Identifying and addressing unanticipated emergent results is a particular challenge in engineering SoS.

G.3.2 Agreement processes Agreement Processes are crucial for SoS because they establish the modes of developmental and operational control among the organizations responsible for the SoS and the often independent constituent systems.  Constituent systems, which are acquired and managed by different organizations, often hold original objectives that may not align with those of the SoS. Except in the directed SoS case, the SoS organization cannot task a constituent system organization without their cooperation.  In an acknowledged or collaborative SoS, these tasks are balanced against the tasks of the constituent system as a SOI in its own right. For virtual SoS, agreement processes may be informal, or considered only for analysis purposes G.3.3 Organizational project-enabling processes In a typical system-of-interest, Organizational Project-Enabling Processes establish the environment in which projects are conducted. The organization establishes the processes and life cycle models to be used by projects; establishes, redirects, or cancels projects; provides resources required, including human and financial; and sets and monitors the quality measures for systems and other deliverables that are developed by projects for internal and external customers. (Subclause 6.2). In an SoS, the owners of the constituent systems usually retain responsibility for engineering their systems and they each have their own Organizational Project-Enabling Processes.  Depending on the SoS type, the SoS also applies these Organizational Project-Enabling Processes to the particular considerations of the SoS -  planning, analyzing, organizing, and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a SoS capability. Consequently, in SoS these Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are implemented at two levels.  The organizations responsible for the constituent systems implement these processes for their SOI independent of the SoS.  The SoS organization (or in collaborative systems of systems by agreement of the SoS) implement these processes for the SoS for those considerations that apply to the overall SoS.  For example, Human Resource Management is addressed by each constituent system organization for the engineering of their system.  The SoS organization would only address this for the systems engineering activities that apply across the constituent systems to the SoS. A particular challenge in SoS engineering is the lack of alignment among the constituent system Organizational Project-Enabling Processes and those of the SoS.  Constituent systems processes are designed to meet their own outcomes and may not align with those of the SoS.  For example, Portfolio Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  104 © ISO/IEC 2015 – All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved Management will be a constituent system responsibility in cases where the constituent system organization has full control over the constituent system and other systems and projects in its portfolio, and the SoS organization will need an approach to Portfolio Management that recognizes this. G.3.4 Technical management processes In a typical system-of-interest, Technical Management Processes are concerned with managing the resources and assets allocated by organization management and with applying them to fulfill the agreements into which the organization or organizations enter.  They relate to the management of projects, in particular to planning in terms of cost, timescales and achievements; to the checking of actions for compliance with plans and performance criteria; and to the identification and selection of corrective actions that recover shortfalls in progress and achievement. They are used to establish and perform technical plans for the project, manage information across the technical team, assess technical progress against the plans for the system products or services, control technical tasks through to completion, and to aid in the decision-making process (subclause 6.3). The Technical Management Processes are also implemented at the level of the SoS and that of the constituent systems. Technical Management Processes are applied to the particular considerations of SoS engineering - planning, analyzing, organizing, and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a system of systems capability. In parallel, the constituent systems organizations retain responsibility for engineering their systems and for their own Technical Management Processes. The SoS organization addresses the Technical Management process as they apply across the SoS, while the processes are also implemented independently in the constituent system organizations. For configuration management for instance, constituent systems manage their own configurations while the SoS addresses configuration management as it applies to the mix of systems in the SoS.  Risk is managed by the constituent systems based on assessment of risk as it applies to their outcomes while the SoS risk management looks at risk to the SoS. Planning and Assessment and Control are key to all management practices (subclause 6.3; page 31); a key challenge in systems of systems engineering is the lack of control by the SoS organization over the processes for the constituent systems (particularly for acknowledged and collaborative SoS). Driven by their own organizational requirements, each of the constituent systems may be on a development or upgrade schedule that differs from the schedules of other constituent systems.  The SoS organization must plan an integrated life cycle that recognizes the independent changes in the constituent systems, in addition to the SoS-initiated changes in a life cycle that treats the SoS as the SOI.  This often involves the definition of stable intermediate forms that punctuate the SoS evolution with incremental capabilities added among the constituent systems. G.3.5 Technical processes Technical Processes are concerned with technical actions throughout the life cycle.  They transform the needs of stakeholders first into a product and then, by applying that product, provide a sustainable service, when and where needed in order to achieve customer satisfaction.  The Technical Processes are applied in order to create and use a system, whether it is in the form of a model or is a finished product, and they apply at any level in a hierarchy of system structure (Subclause 6.4). As with the other processes when applied to SoS, Technical Processes are implemented for both the SoS and constituent systems; in some cases, the SoS implementation is by means of conduct of the constituent system processes rather than for the SoS as a whole. Business or Mission Analysis for an SoS looks across the full SoS business and mission environment.  To the degree the constituent system was developed to operate in that space, the Business or Mission Analysis for the systems of system and constituent systems will be largely shared.  The objective is to determine the best means to provide the desired capability. Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition will focus on the top level SoS, but also consider how the disparate needs of the stakeholders for the individual systems may lead to constraints on the system of systems.

The Architecture for the SoS is a framework for organizing and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a SoS capability, leaving the architectures of the constituent systems to their organizations.  Because the constituent systems in an SoS usually predate the SoS, SoS Architecture Definition often begins with the de facto architecture of the SoS. Architecture alternatives are then examined in order to frame stakeholder concerns and meet top level system of system requirements, and to recognize the effect of new requirements for the constituent systems and accommodate the constituent system architecture constraints. The Design Definition process provides sufficient detailed data and information to enable the SoS implementation.  This involves collaboration with the constituent systems who will conduct their own design trades to identify the approach to address SoS requirements as they apply to their system.  These are the responsibility of the constituent system organization and Implementation is a done by the constituent system with the SoS organization in a monitoring role. Integration, Verification, Transition, Validation are all done by the constituent systems for the changes they implement to support requirements generated by the SoS.  These processes also apply to the SoS when the upgraded constituent systems are integrated into the SoS and performance is verified and validated.  The independent and asynchronous nature of constituent systems in an SoS pose challenges to effective implementation of these processes as implemented in a traditional SOI.  It may be that the SoS-level evaluations can only be performed in the operational environment, in which case precautionary measures should be considered to avoid adverse SoS-behavior. Finally, the Operations, Maintenance and Disposal Processes tend to be implemented by the constituent systems, given their management and operational independence.  There may be SoS-level interactions to facilitate those processes.

It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. This International Standard also provides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the life cycle processes used within an organization or a project. Organizations and projects can use these life cycle processes when acquiring and supplying systems. This International Standard concerns those systems that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities. When a system element is software, the software life cycle processes documented in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 may be used to implement that system element. The two standards are harmonized for concurrent use on a single project or in a single organization. When the system element is hardware, refer to other International Standards outside the scope of SC7.
