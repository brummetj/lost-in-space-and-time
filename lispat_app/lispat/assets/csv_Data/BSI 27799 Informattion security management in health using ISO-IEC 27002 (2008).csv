The first example (A.2) represents the system configurations 1a and 1b from Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1. The subsequent three examples (A.3 to A.5) are variations of system configuration 2b, from Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1:2010, with increasing complexity. Within the following diagrams the MEDICAL DEVICE being connected to the general purpose IT NETWORK is shown as a collection of equipment on its own specific network. Equally the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK could consist of a one or more discrete MEDICAL DEVICES connected directly to the general purpose IT NETWORK. A.2 Isolated network configuration The example presented in Figure A.1 is comparable to system configuration 1 described in Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1:2010. As this example is not explicit as to whether the equipment is sourced from one or more MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers, the interpretation is equally applicable to system configurations 1a and 1b. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a provider of radiological services for a small community. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a single facility and is not associated with any other RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has two segregated networks operating within the facility. The first is a general purpose IT network that is used for the day-to-day business applications. The second is a MEDICAL DEVICE network comprising diagnostic imaging equipment that was installed by a single MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer. As these networks are independent from one another, this configuration is outside the scope of IEC 80001-1.

The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a provider of radiological services for a small community. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a single facility and is not associated with any other RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has two networks operating within the facility. The first is a general purpose IT network that is used for the day-to-day business applications. The second is a MEDICAL DEVICE network comprising diagnostic imaging equipment that was purchased from MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers. These two networks have been connected together to form a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK is used to store radiological images onto a server that was provided by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The radiological images that are stored can be retrieved and distributed via the general purpose IT network.

The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a provider of radiological services for a small community, comprising two separate facilities. Each facility has a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, as per the configuration defined in A.3, with the two connected together, in this example, via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is an acute care hospital serving a large community with a variety of services, for example, diagnostic imaging and pathology. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has many MEDICAL DEVICES operating on segregated networks that were purchased and installed by the individual MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers. However, these networks are connected to a single MEDICAL IT-NETWORK within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION.

The objectives of AAMI's technical development program derive from AAMI's overall mission: the advancement of medical instrumentation. Essential to such advancement are (1) a continued increase in the safe and effective application of current technologies to patient care, and (2) the encouragement of new technologies. It is AAMI's view that standards and recommended practices can contribute significantly to the advancement of medical instrumentation, provided that they are drafted with attention to these objectives and provided that arbitrary and restrictive uses are avoided. A voluntary standard for a medical device recommends to the manufacturer the information that should be provided with or on the product, basic safety and performance criteria that should be considered in qualifying the device for clinical use, and the measurement techniques that can be used to determine whether the device conforms with the safety and performance criteria and/or to compare the performance characteristics of different products. Some standards emphasize the information that should be provided with the device, including performance characteristics, instructions for use, warnings and precautions, and other data considered important in ensuring the safe and effective use of the device in the clinical environment. Recommending the disclosure of performance characteristics often necessitates the development of specialized test methods to facilitate uniformity in reporting; reaching consensus on these tests can represent a considerable part of committee work. When a drafting committee determines that clinical concerns warrant the establishment of minimum safety and performance criteria, referee tests must be provided and the reasons for establishing the criteria must be documented in the rationale.  A recommended practice provides guidelines for the use, care, and/or processing of a medical device or system. A recommended practice does not address device performance per se, but rather procedures and practices that will help ensure that a device is used safely and effectively and that its performance will be maintained. Although a device standard is primarily directed to the manufacturer, it may also be of value to the potential purchaser or user of the device as a frame of reference for device evaluation. Similarly, even though a recommended practice is usually oriented towards healthcare professionals, it may be useful to the manufacturer in better understanding the environment in which a medical device will be used. Also, some recommended practices, while not addressing device performance criteria, provide guidelines to industrial personnel on such subjects as sterilization processing, methods of collecting data to establish safety and efficacy, human engineering, and other processing or evaluation techniques; such guidelines may be useful to health care professionals in understanding industrial practices. In determining whether an AAMI standard or recommended practice is relevant to the specific needs of a potential user of the document, several important concepts must be recognized: All AAMI standards and recommended practices are voluntary (unless, of course, they are adopted by government regulatory or procurement authorities). The application of a standard or recommended practice is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Each AAMI standard or recommended practice reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care professionals and industrial representatives, whose work has been reviewed nationally (and sometimes internationally). As such, the consensus recommendations embodied in a standard or recommended practice are intended to respond to clinical needs and, ultimately, to help ensure patient safety. A standard or recommended practice is limited, however, in the sense that it responds generally to perceived risks and conditions that may not always be relevant to specific situations. A standard or recommended practice is an important reference in responsible decision-making, but it should never replace responsible decision-making. Despite periodic review and revision (at least once every five years), a standard or recommended practice is necessarily a static document applied to a dynamic technology. Therefore, a standards user must carefully review the reasons why the document was initially developed and the specific rationale for each of its provisions. This review will reveal whether the document remains relevant to the specific needs of the user. Particular care should be taken in applying a product standard to existing devices and equipment, and in applying a recommended practice to current procedures and practices. While observed or potential risks with existing equipment typically form the basis for the safety and performance criteria defined in a standard, professional judgment must be used in applying these criteria to existing equipment. No single source of information will serve to identify a particular product as unsafe"".",A,voluntary,standard,can,be,used,as,one,"resource,",but,the,ultimate,decision,as,to,product,safety,and,efficacy,must,take,into,account,the,specifics,of,its,utilization,"and,",of,"course,",cost-benefit,considerations.,"Similarly,",a,recommended,practice,should,be,analyzed,in,the,context,of,the,specific,needs,and,resources,of,the,individual,institution,or,firm.,"Again,",the,rationale,accompanying,each,AAMI,standard,and,recommended,practice,is,an,excellent,guide,to,the,reasoning,and,data,underlying,its,provision.,In,"summary,",a,standard,or,recommended,practice,is,truly,useful,only,when,it,is,used,in,conjunction,with,other,sources,of,information,and,policy,guidance,and,in,the,context,of,professional,experience,and,judgment.,,INTERPRETATIONS,OF,AAMI,STANDARDS,AND,RECOMMENDED,PRACTICES,,Requests,for,interpretations,of,AAMI,standards,and,recommended,practices,must,be,made,in,"writing,",to,the,AAMI,Vice,"President,",Standards,Policy,and,Programs.,An,official,interpretation,must,be,approved,by,letter,ballot,of,the,originating,committee,and,subsequently,reviewed,and,approved,by,the,AAMI,Standards,Board.,The,interpretation,will,become,official,and,representation,of,the,Association,only,upon,exhaustion,of,any,appeals,and,upon,publication,of,notice,of,interpretation,in,the,Standards
