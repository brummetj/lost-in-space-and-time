Although the material presented in a TIR may need further evaluation by experts, releasing the information is valuable because the industry and the professions have an immediate need for it. A TIR differs markedly from a standard or recommended practice, and readers should understand the differences between these documents. Standards and recommended practices are subject to a formal process of committee approval, public review, and resolution of all comments. This process of consensus is supervised by the AAMI Standards Board and, in the case of American National Standards, by the American National Standards Institute. A TIR is not subject to the same formal approval process as a standard. However, a TIR is approved for distribution by a technical committee and the AAMI Standards Board.  Another difference is that, although both standards and TIRs are periodically reviewed, a standard must be acted on—reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn—and the action formally approved usually every five years but at least every 10 years. For a TIR, AAMI consults with a technical committee about five years after the publication date (and periodically thereafter) for guidance on whether the document is still useful—that is, to check that the information is relevant or of historical value. If the information is not useful, the TIR is removed from circulation. A TIR may be developed because it is more responsive to underlying safety or performance issues than a standard or recommended practice, or because achieving consensus is extremely difficult or unlikely. Unlike a standard, a TIR permits the inclusion of differing viewpoints on technical issues. CAUTION NOTICE: This AAMI TIR may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Because it addresses a rapidly evolving field or technology, readers are cautioned to ensure that they have also considered information that may be more recent than this document. All standards, recommended practices, technical information reports, and other types of technical documents developed by AAMI are voluntary, and their application is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Occasionally, voluntary technical documents are adopted by government regulatory agencies or procurement authorities, in which case the adopting agency is responsible for enforcement of its rules and regulations.

International Standards adopted in the United States may include normative references to other International Standards. For each International Standard that has been adopted by AAMI (and ANSI), the table below gives the corresponding U.S. designation and level of equivalency to the International Standard. NOTE: Documents are sorted by international designation. The code in the US column, “(R)20xx” indicates the year the document was officially reaffirmed by AAMI. E.g., ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-4:2002/(R)2009 indicates that 10993-4, originally approved and published in 2002, was reaffirmed without change in 2009. Other normatively referenced International Standards may be under consideration for U.S. adoption by AAMI; therefore, this list should not be considered exhaustive.

The United States is one of the IEC members that took an active role in the development of this technical report.  International technical report IEC/TR 80001-2-3:2012 was developed jointly by Subcommittee IEC/SC 62A, Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, and ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, to define the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security.  U.S. participation in this IEC SC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A administered by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. AAMI administers the International Secretariat for IEC/SC 62A on behalf of the United States, and U.S. experts made a considerable contribution to this Technical Report.  AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with International Standards in the area of risk management of information technology as it relates to medical devices.  The AAMI Information Technology Working Group together with the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, reviewed IEC/TR 80001-2-3 to formulate the U.S. position and comments while the document was being developed. This close collaboration helped gain widespread U.S. consensus on the document. As the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, AdvaMed granted AAMI permission to consider adoption of IEC/TR 80001-2-3 as a new AAMI Technical Information Report. Following AAMI procedures, the AAMI Information Technology Working Group voted to adopt the IEC technical report as written.  AAMI has adopted other IEC and ISO documents. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of IEC and ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the IEC and ISO standard.  The concepts incorporated in this technical information report should not be considered inflexible or static. This technical information report, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new data comes to light.  Publication of this Technical Report that has been registered with ANSI has been approved by the Accredited Standards Developer (AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633). This document is registered as a Technical Report according to the Procedures for the Registration of Technical Reports with ANSI. This document is not an American National Standard and the material contained herein is not normative in nature.  As used within the context of this document, “should” indicates that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action should be avoided but is not prohibited. “May” is used to indicate that a course of action is permissible within the limits of the technical information report. “Can” is used as a statement of possibility and capability. Finally, “must” is used only to describe “unavoidable” situations, including those mandated by government regulation.    Suggestions for improving this document are invited. Comments and suggested revisions should be sent to Standards Department, AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Dr. Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633.

The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The main task of IEC technical committees is to prepare International Standards. However, a technical committee may propose the publication of a technical report when it has collected data of a different kind from that which is normally published as an International Standard, for example "state of the art". IEC 80001-2-3, which is a technical report, has been prepared by a Joint Working Group of subcommittee 62A: Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, of IEC technical committee 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice and ISO technical committee 215: Health informatics.

Early examples of the use of wireless technologies and MEDICAL DEVICES include ambulatory cardiac monitoring systems in hospitals and telemetry systems used by paramedics over wide area wireless networks. While these solutions were based on proprietary technology, the advent of off-the-shelf standards-based approaches has resulted in increasingly ubiquitous wireless communications systems both indoors and outdoors. These provide and enable compelling and varied use cases for connection between MEDICAL DEVICES and information systems. Wireless technology has great benefits; however, as with any technology, certain RISKS are introduced that can affect the three KEY PROPERTIES of SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, and DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY. This document will review the challenges associated with wireless technologies and provide guidance regarding the safe, effective, and secure use of MEDICAL DEVICES on a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. This is done in a framework that follows the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS as defined by the IEC 80001-1 standard. The targeted audience for this technical report is the HDO IT department, biomedical and clinical engineering departments, risk managers, and the people responsible for design and operation of the wireless IT network. For the purposes of this technical report, “should” is used to indicate that amongst several possibilities to meet a requirement, one is recommended as being particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required. This term is not to be interpreted as indicating requirement. 0.2 Organization of the technical report This technical report is divided into five main clauses, a bibliography and two annexes. Clause 4 provides an overview of a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and reviews varying types of wireless technologies and their applicability to healthcare. The next three clauses focus on the high level steps involved with understanding and defining the networking performance characteristics, requirements and associated RISK CONTROL measures regarding the creation a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, namely: a) planning and design; b) deployment and implementation; and c) operational management. Clause 8 provides general RISK CONTROL measures that might be applicable to an HDO's unique MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Finally, a bibliography is included that lists references for further exploration. Annex A offers a table that suggests a mapping between MEDICAL DEVICE data types and associated networking QUALITY OF SERVICE priorities. Annex B is a checklist questionnaire for assistance in performing a RISK ANALYSIS. 0.3 Clinical functionality and use case One of the fundamental concepts that this technical report emphasizes is that MEDICAL DEVICES have networking characteristics that are similar to other types of general purpose devices and applications; yet the repercussions of not properly designing and managing the network to ensure the SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT of the MEDICAL DEVICES could negatively impact clinical functionality. This can lead to erroneous diagnostics and/or missed treatment that can ultimately affect patient health outcome. In this technical report, clinical functionality and the clinical use case are interchangeable; they are a reference to the means by which a clinician (nurse, physician, etc.) performs their clinical duties across the wireless network, and includes the AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  xv component of patient care and SAFETY. These are components in the overall context as it is referred to in the step-by-step technical report, IEC 80001-2-1, and this information is required for a complete RISK ANALYSIS. A typical example is a nurse who is remotely monitoring a patient from the nursing central station using a patient monitor at the bedside that is wirelessly connected to the network. The clinical functionality is the remote monitoring of a patient’s health. 0.4 Wireless guidance and RISK MANAGEMENT The wireless link between a patient and the remote clinician is now a component of the clinical functionality and may impact the KEY PROPERTIES of SAFETY and DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY. While the benefits of wireless access are well known and documented, typically the wireless link between a MEDICAL DEVICE and a clinician is more likely, or has a higher probability, of experiencing a loss of connectivity versus that of a wired connection. This is a motivation behind the creation and focus of this technical report. Because the definitions of HAZARD, HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS, HARM and causes are use case specific to each HDO, this document should be used in conjunction with both the IEC 80001-1 and IEC/TR 80001-2-1 at a minimum. Figure 1 provides an overview of the RISK MANAGEMENT aspect of this technical report. The column of boxes on the left of the figure is an overview (for this technical report’s purpose) of the 10 steps of RISK MANAGEMENT as defined in the IEC/TR 80001-2-1. The center boxes show the steps of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS that this technical report is focused on. They are the following in terms of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS: – The cause is an event that can turn a HAZARD into a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Examples of causes in a wireless network are RF interference, wireless network misconfiguration, or networking device failure.  – A HAZARD associated in the context of wireless connectivity is the loss or impairment of connectivity in a medical system. This disruption in connectivity can negatively impact the ability of a MEDICAL DEVICE or clinical system to perform its intended function. – A HAZARDOUS SITUATION is a circumstance in which the MEDICAL DEVICE or clinical functionality is exposed to a HAZARD. For example, a clinician is monitoring a patient at the nursing station (clinical functionality is remote monitoring). If RF interference causes the wireless network to be disabled (loss of connectivity is the HAZARD), then the patient is no longer being remotely monitored (HAZARDOUS SITUATION). – The RISK CONTROL measures as used in this technical report are the steps taken to reduce the probability of the occurrence of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (referred to as P1 in IEC/TR 80001-2-1), or the steps taken to reduce the probability of HARM once the HAZARDOUS SITUATION has occurred (referred to as P2 in IEC/TR 80001-2-1). A P1 RISK CONTROL measure example might be RF redundancy or networking change control procedures. A P2 RISK CONTROL measure example might be the sequence of actions that a nurse would take if notified that the connectivity is lost between a patient monitor and central station. The majority of this technical report focuses on the design and RISK CONTROL measures associated with wireless technologies. However, and this is another motivation for engaging with the clinicians early in the planning phase, the role of the clinicians in mitigating against patient HARM should be clearly reviewed. In the example used in the bulleted steps above, the clinician might have a documented procedure to follow during network outages; when the network experiences loss of connectivity the clinician can follow a procedure where they need to attend to the patient directly.

The report provides technical background concerning wireless technology and examples of HAZARDS to be considered when wireless technology is used in MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS and suggests RISK CONTROL measures to reduce the probability of UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. 1.2 Objective This Technical Report, as part of IEC 80001, considers the use of wirelessly networked MEDICAL DEVICES on a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and offers practical techniques to address the unique RISK MANAGEMENT requirements of operating wirelessly enabled MEDICAL DEVICES in a safe, secure and effective manner. This technical report is focused on wireless technologies from an agnostic viewpoint; however, there are particular wireless technologies that are predominant in HDOS (e.g. 802.11) and are discussed in more detail. Where appropriate, these differences are pointed out and discussed. In addition, while it does not focus on a single wireless technology, it is assumed that the attached wired infrastructure is an Ethernet-based IP network. It is not the intent of this document to propose a regimented step-by-step PROCESS for implementing a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or mitigating the RISK associated with a particular wireless technology.  There are many reasons which conspire against such an effort and chief among them are: – There are many different wireless technologies available, each with their PHY, MAC and upper layer characteristics with varying degrees of control available to the HDO. – Many wireless technologies are in an evolving stage of development and are still subject to frequent and significant changes. – HDOs, depending on their needs, might utilize varying combinations of wireless technologies to meet their particular requirements. Each technology should require its own independent RISK ANALYSIS and RISK CONTROL measures that should be reviewed systemically (aggregate RISKS ANALYSIS). – Each HDO will have their own unique clinical use cases and network topologies and will perform their own unique RISK ANALYSIS and management that will differ from other HDOs. Instead, this technical report acknowledges a generalized or high level approach relative to a step-by-step PROCESS review that both inherently and intentionally considers HAZARDS, the causes leading to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS, and RISK CONTROL measures. The general approach that this technical report follows is the following: AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/20162  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 a) Pose the question: Does the use case of the device require wireless connectivity? This is not a trivial question but this technical report assumes the answer is “yes”. b) Define the clinical use-cases/functionality by bringing together the clinicians, biomedical engineering staff and whoever else might be involved in the use and support of the MEDICAL DEVICES.  c) Review the wireless specifications and capabilities of the MEDICAL DEVICE(S) and systems and create baseline networking performance requirements. d) Create the clinical SLA by mapping the networking performance requirements to the clinical functionality. See Table A.1 for examples regarding this mapping. e) Match the wireless networking performance requirements of the MEDICAL DEVICES and systems to the existing capabilities of the general purpose IT-NETWORK and identify gaps or incompatibilities. Take into consideration the wireless network configurations and networking performance requirements of all existing or planned wireless non-MEDICAL DEVICES. f) Complete the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, including identification and implementation of RISK CONTROL measures relative to the KEY PROPERTIES. Many RISK CONTROL measures are very much like “best design practices”, but are documented, applied, and VERIFIED as part of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. g) Design and configure the network(s) to match the SLAs of all devices (medical and non-medical). h) Perform pre-GO-LIVE network testing to VERIFY that all devices properly coexist while maintaining their particular SLA. i) Use operational measures to monitor and manage the live network such that SLAs are continuously being met. 1.3 HDO scalability The scope of this document is targeted at all HDOs regardless of network size. Large networks might have to deal with many devices and complex application mixes using both wired and wireless networks. They might or might not have life critical patient data traversing the network. Other networks can be smaller in scale, simpler in the number of devices and applications operating on the network, but also might have life critical data on the network. The complexity of the networks and the patient SAFETY aspect of the network traffic drive the extent of HAZARD analysis and RISK MANAGEMENT required. The patient SAFETY aspect requires that a RISK MANAGEMENT plan be completed while the network complexity translates into the level of complexity in the RISK CONTROL measures. One can certainly argue that a small network (e.g. physician office) that uses wireless technology does not need to go through the same level of RISK ANALYSIS as a hospital. For example, there are small catheterization laboratories and small cosmetic surgery practices that might have small scale networks, yet have patient data on the network. All HDOs have to manage the security of their networks and evaluate their clinical functionality for patient SAFETY implications. HDOs need to manage their network wireless technology deployments with an appropriate and scaled attention to RISK MANAGEMENT. While this document focuses on deployment issues for complex wireless deployments, its guidance, appropriately applied, can be used in many different networked environments, both large and small.  2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application.

The following are some of the high level challenges faced in implementing a wireless medical IT network: – the introduction of smart phones and tablet devices running apps from social networks to cardiology viewers; – lack of RF and wireless competency in the hospital IT, biomedical and clinical engineering staff; – use of crowded unlicensed spectrum; – proprietary functions on top of standards (e.g. 802.11); – securing data on wireless devices as well as over the air; – formal organizational engagement between IT, biomedical and clinical engineering staff. Typically these challenges are addressed using the concept of “best practices” in designing and managing a wireless network. Many of the best practices used to address these challenges are AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201614  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 categorized as RISK CONTROL measures in the vernacular of IEC 80001-1:2010. This technical report proposes to integrate these and other best practices into the PROCESS of applying RISK MANAGEMENT to the development of a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The challenges associated with meeting the SLA needs of many varied devices are compounded by the fact that MEDICAL DEVICES can have multiple levels of RISK in a single device. This technical report will emphasize that the same type of traffic in a clinical device can have varying clinical importance depending on the clinical use case or functionality. As an example, physiological data generally do not have a real time requirement when transferred into an EMR. However, if the data is going to a clinician and includes real time information about a patient’s current status, then a delay in delivering this same data has now an increased HAZARD severity and might require stronger RISK CONTROL measure. Thus it is not enough to use the performance characteristics of a MEDICAL DEVICE to design and configure the network, but the clinical aspects of how the device is used and maintained are also a part of the network design solution. 4.2 Enterprise MEDICAL IT-NETWORK Design of hospital networks is very challenging in wireless environments because of the complex physical environment and its impact on the propagation of RF signals, as well as the large number of disparate devices that operate on the network. The RF environment is typically complicated by mobile metal equipment (e.g. metal food or drug cart), walls comprised of building materials with varying RF propagation characteristics, and floor plans that change from one department to the next. The types of devices on a healthcare network include multiple types of general purpose, non-MEDICAL DEVICES as well as MEDICAL DEVICES. Some examples of these devices are guest access devices, workstations on wheels running various applications, infusion pumps, handheld data entry devices such as PDAs or tablet PCs, VOIP communication devices, RFID tags, and patient monitors. Each of these devices has its own data and traffic characteristics using various communication protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.) and with its own network performance requirements (which can vary with the clinical functionality as in the lab test results mentioned above). A device can have multiple clinical functions that include patient mobility; large image files transfers, real time clinical alerts and alarms, and transfer of physiological data into an EMR. These clinical functions, along with the device network performance requirements and data traffic profiles, define the clinical SLA. Clinical functionality maps into networking use cases, where mobility, security, low latency, high availability and other networking performance metrics need to be met. Succinctly, the differences between meeting the networking performance requirements of a general purpose wireless device compared to that of a MEDICAL DEVICE, is that the consequences of not meeting the SLA of a general purposes computer is the inconvenience of a slow network connection. A HAZARD caused by not meeting the SLA of a MEDICAL DEVICE could result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION and potential HARM to a patient. The diagram in Figure 2 below shows a simplified example of a wired and wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK carrying traffic from both MEDICAL DEVICES and general purpose devices. The use of VLANs to logically separate traffic types is common in wired networking technology and is extended to the wireless technology at the network edge by various means (e.g. SSIDs are often mapped to a specific VLAN). In addition to the many types of traffic and associated SLAs, multiple communication paths between MEDICAL DEVICES and nursing central stations or through the data center into a centralized monitoring room can exist across a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. 4.3 Use of VLANs and SSIDs The use of VLANs is common in wired networks, but every additional VLAN and subsequent SSID comes with a certain overhead of BROADCAST/MULTICAST traffic that can negatively affect available capacity on the wireless link. Care needs to be used in simply using VLANs and SSIDs to segment traffic. Other mechanisms to logically separate traffic should also be explored in order to minimize overhead of BROADCAST/MULTICAST traffic associated with using multiple VLANs. These other options might include using multiple frequencies or bands with differing SSIDs and proprietary mechanisms provided by a WLAN infrastructure provider. Isolating devices using unique VLANs and ESSIDs is not considered a best practice, especially if the AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  15 group of devices that need to be isolated grows large, since every additional ESSID and VLAN brings with it an additional overhead on the wireless channel.   Figure 2 – HDO MEDICAL IT-NETWORK 4.4 Wide area MEDICAL IT-NETWORK Figure 3 shows a model where MEDICAL DEVICES communicate across WIDE AREA NETWORKS, both wired and wireless, to deliver medical traffic for remote clinical access. This could be the gathering of data from remotely monitored patients at home or more advanced capabilities where video feeds allow a physician real-time, interactive access to patient data in their home. Many of the intermediate networks in the wide-area use case have components that belong to different administrative domains making it difficult to assure end-to-end SLAs. As such, these large network components make it difficult to ensure the performance required for real-time patient alarms and response where patient SAFETY is dependent on the overall network performance. The return on the benefits for the use of a particular infrastructure, such as cellular, needs to be weighed against the RISKS. For example, for patients remote to the hospital, clinical expertise assistance across a wireless WAN, such as a cellular network, would be beneficial, even if the physician is sometimes unavailable due to a WAN outage.

Some of these applications are, or will be, targeted at healthcare. The use of these devices and their healthcare applications will reach both into the hospital as well as medical office buildings, clinics and homes. Just like any MEDICAL DEVICE, how the application is used clinically as well as the expected performance capabilities of the network(s) that the healthcare data transverses, should be used in the RISK ANALYSIS. 4.5.2 Application clinical functionality While the smart phone hardware is generally not operated as a MEDICAL DEVICE, the use of healthcare applications and their intended clinical functionality will determine whether or not RISK CONTROL measures are warranted. The challenge to the IT department in an HDO lies in the fact that the network can be a WAN that is not under the configuration and control of the HDO IT administration. This does not mean that RISK CONTROL measures are not possible, just that the performance of the external network has to be understood and defined in terms of the clinical functionality and expectations of the user. It is important that the end user, whether it is a physician or patient, understand the performance capabilities of the underlying network and that some RISK CONTROL measures might need to be managed at the device by the user. For example, the reliability of a cellular or wireless broadband networks might be acceptable for the use case of a physician remotely reviewing patient health records using a smart phone. However, the physician would need to be prepared for the circumstance that the wireless data connection could be unavailable at a given place and time. 4.5.3 Cellular networks The advent of 4th generation (4G) networks and devices with much higher data rates, the introduction of femto cells for localized wireless deployment, and the continued evolution and advancement of smart phones will have an impact on the HDO and its ability to safely manage its network. In order to accommodate the increasing demand for bandwidth by both medical and non-medical applications and devices, it is necessary to consider the use of all networks. For example, a smart phone that includes both 802.11 and 3G/4G radios, often defaults to the       Secure Tunnel    Gateway (5) Hospital Gateway  Air Interfac Wireline Interface Wireless WAN   Cellular Tower (3)  HDO WLAN/LAN Network VPN -65 Cellular Network (4) Interface IEC   1301/12 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  17 802.11 network. This can place an unnecessary burden on the 802.11 WLAN. In this case, forcing the device to operate on the 3G/4G network is an example of a RISK CONTROL measure. 4.5.4 Smart phone coexistence Smart phones generally include an 802.11 radio (in addition to a cellular radio) that is used for broadband access when available. If there are many smart phones in use in an HDO enterprise with demanding broadband network access requirements (e.g. wireless video, voice, etc.), then the devices can overload the capacity of the network and cause network outages that affect all devices attached to the 802.11 WLAN. Even though the smart phones might or might not be used for medical purposes, they will impact the security and performance of all devices on the network if not properly provisioned. Properly provisioning the network such that smart phones, regardless of the application, do not overload the network is a design and configuration RISK CONTROL measure that should be considered. See 6.4 for general guidance on RISK CONTROL measures. 4.5.5 Wireless data security  The transfer of patient HEALTH DATA requires that strong mechanisms be in place for securing that data. RISK CONTROL measures to prevent the loss or theft of PRIVATE DATA  or HEALTH DATA includes the use of technologies preventing the storage of PRIVATE DATA or HEALTH DATA and/or remote wiping/destruction of data from the device. Security measures related to encryption and user authorization on networks are covered in the remaining clauses of this technical report. Additional information can be found in the security technical report (see bibliography) 4.6 DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS Some HDOs consider DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS (DAS) to extend cellular, paging, public SAFETY and other RF signals through the building over a shared antenna infrastructure. The infrastructure can include active and passive technologies and many infrastructures include a hybrid of both. A passive system uses splitters, couplers, and coaxial cable to carry the signals in the form of RF energy to radiators/antennas that distribute the signal throughout the desired area. An active system communicates digital data to remote electronics that convert the digital signal to/from RF and amplify both the received and transmitted RF signals. A hybrid fiber/coax system adds passive distribution after the remote electronics. If designed, deployed, provisioned, and validated correctly, DAS can provide operational benefits versus deploying a separate in-building antenna system for multiple WSPs, because a single DAS can provide coverage for each WSP throughout the enterprise facility. This is especially true when carrying cellular signals into an enterprise. The HDO should recognize that this wide-coverage feature causes each WSP device to receive noise from the entire coverage area and this affects the system SNR. Similarly, benefit of DAS increasing the coverage area increases the number of users that are supported by a specific piece of WSP hardware, and this increased user load should be considered in the DAS deployment. It is important to understand the challenges and solutions when using 802.11 technologies over a DAS. Some DAS vendors support integrating 802.11 over DAS, others do not. At this time, 802.11 infrastructure vendors do not certify their equipment in conjunction with DAS. Many of the add-on functions that 802.11 vendors promote and market such as IDS, IPS, location services, and coherent use of multipath propagation to improve RF performance are designed for use with a discrete WLAN architecture and might be compatible, though typically the AP vendors do not guarantee RF performance when using antennas other than those they test and recommend. The use of 802.11n with MIMO offers further challenge to DAS deployments as each input/output stream requires an additional antenna to operate as designed. Some features of 802.11n, such as beam forming, will require additional engineering of the DAS. Consulting with both the DAS vendor, device manufacturer, and the 802.11 infrastructure vendor is critical prior to deploying 802.11 over a DAS.

From the IT perspective, clinicians could be viewed as new customers of the WLAN who bring to the network clinical systems and MEDICAL DEVICES that have unique and varying network performance requirements. 5.1.1 Defining the clinical SLA Understanding how clinicians will use MEDICAL DEVICES in their work flow, as defined in this technical report as clinical functionality, is a first step in the early planning stages of applying RISK MANAGEMENT to wireless networks. It is a challenging task to support, ensure and manage the many SLAs that exist on a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK some of which will have life-critical aspects. From general purpose guest internet access to mission-critical business applications to patient monitoring devices, the networking performance requirements are varied and diverse. The clinical SLA is comprised of both the device level network performance requirements and the clinical helpdesk-type support and procedural systems. Following is a list of typical components of a clinical SLA: – device level network performance requirements (packet loss, delay, etc.); – helpdesk support response times; – network uptime or availability; – wireless coverage areas, signal levels and bandwidth availability; – security; – communication protocol support & configuration; – disaster recovery procedures; – device maintenance scheduling. Compiling and documenting the baseline clinical SLA is a key deliverable in the planning and design of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. This is accomplished by engaging with the clinicians and biomedical engineering staff during the planning and design phase to understand the PROCESSES and clinical functionality associated with the networked devices. 5.1.2 Creating partnerships With the introduction of MEDICAL DEVICES and clinical systems to a general purpose wireless IT network, one of the initial considerations is the inclusion of the clinicians, the biomedical engineers, and the IT engineering team in the planning PROCESS. The network designer gains insight into the network performance requirements of a clinical system by reviewing with the clinicians and supporting staff how and where each type of MEDICAL DEVICE will be used. Without this understanding it is not possible to define the clinical SLA of the MEDICAL DEVICE(S) or systems. Please refer to the table in Annex A for an example overview of MEDICAL DEVICES and their clinical and networking traffic requirements. The table in Annex A illustrates the different data types that might be encountered in a wireless MEDICAL DEVICE and their associated network profiles. Annex B provides a list of questions to consider when defining the networking performance requirements of MEDICAL DEVICES on a wireless network. 5.1.3 Geographical location An input to defining the clinical functionality includes identifying the geographical area where the clinicians will use the MEDICAL DEVICES, applications and systems. Devices that support mobility AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  19 across the enterprise can require one or both internal and external handover support across wireless networks. Devices that are used in a specific area (e.g., ICU) might best be supported through using an isolated wireless infrastructure dedicated to MEDICAL DEVICES. These are all considerations that should be evaluated during the planning phase to choose the appropriate wireless technology. 5.1.4 Clinical use case Asking the clinicians “how” they expect to use the devices will help in defining the networking priority that is attached to the device and/or clinical system. For example, does it involve archiving data, or is there a real time aspect that includes life critical information such as patient alarms? Engage with the biomedical engineers who support the clinical systems to understand how they support the systems. What are their maintenance plans including the upgrading of devices, and seek a partnership where PROCESSES and procedures are jointly managed when the network is involved. Determine how the devices are configured for network access. The outcome of these efforts will be a clear understanding of the networking priority that needs to be applied to the MEDICAL DEVICE and systems and jointly defined rules of engagement regarding the management of the devices and network related clinical support models. 5.2 MEDICAL DEVICE wireless capabilities Accompanying the investigation of the clinical functionality is a need to understand the wireless capabilities and performance characteristics of the MEDICAL DEVICES, applications and systems. Engaging with the MDM to fully understand the MEDICAL DEVICE capabilities regarding wireless performance is an important early step in the design and configuration of the wireless network. The combination of understanding the clinical functionality along with the device level wireless performance characteristics allows for the establishment of the baseline requirements for wireless networking design. 5.3 MEDICAL DEVICE capabilities and networking traffic profile The wireless technology defines the networking characteristics that provide the boundaries for the wireless performance of the MEDICAL DEVICE. Some examples include but are not limited to: – PHY (physical radio interface); receiver performance specifications, supported modulation and coding types, data rates, frequencies, and transmit power levels; – MAC (link layer component): deterministic vs. non-deterministic network access, QoS capabilities, security, AP handover for roaming, and power saving mechanisms; – network (IP layer): DHCP or BOOTP, subnet or layer 3 roaming, BROADCAST and MULTICAST data type usage; – transport protocol: TCP (connection oriented), UDP (connectionless); – application/device layer: traffic types (real-time, non-real-time), bandwidth, power saving mechanisms, higher layer acknowledgments. Once the capabilities and traffic profile of the MEDICAL DEVICES, systems, and/or application types are understood from a wireless technology perspective, the network designer can begin to design and configure the wired and wireless network to properly support the MEDICAL DEVICES and systems. 5.4 Network performance requirements A MEDICAL IT-NETWORK has to support the performance requirements of the MEDICAL DEVICE systems determined during the planning and design phase; otherwise the clinical system(s) might not be safe, secure or effective. The network performance requirements of all devices once known should be documented to provide a reference baseline for testing before and during installation, and when changes are made that might impact system performance. Changes that can affect device performance include actual network configuration changes, RF environment AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201620  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 modifications, and adding devices to the network. The network performance requirements of every device need to be accommodated in the network topology and configuration. The network should be designed to ensure the network performance requirement for the most sensitive application/device on the network is met while the network maximum load is in place. A listing of some device performance requirements to consider is included in Annex B. A good rule of thumb is to determine the MEDICAL DEVICE performance requirements from the device specification, noting the most restrictive performance requirements. Match these to the performance capabilities (as specified and measured) of the network (wireless and wired). As an example, one manufacturer specifies a maximum network load and maximum number of users on the AP. To ensure these maximums are not reached, the HDO decides to add extra APs in the location where the devices will be used. This RISK CONTROL measure also tends to provide a higher signal strength (and SNR  – see Figure 4) since APs are closer to clients. Because of decreased contention for airtime, bandwidth, latency, packet loss and transceiver performance requirements are all mitigated by this design decision. The use of network monitoring tools to monitor the network performance characteristics, with generation of alerts when conditions degrade, is a further RISK CONTROL measure against failure to maintain device-specific SLAs. 5.5 QoS mechanisms QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) mechanisms provide preferential access to the network within a technology. This can be used to assist in ensuring that the network is able to meet the clinical SLAs required by clients with high priority data by giving these clients more favored access to the network than low priority clients. Wireless technologies have differing methods of providing QoS, and vendors supporting the same standards can implement the QoS mechanism differently. For example, in an 802.11 network, WMM provides four classes of service as a standard option. In addition to this, some vendors might provide traffic shaping and/or reserved airtime via proprietary schemes. The HDO should VERIFY that the wireless clients and the wireless network have compatible and consistent QoS solutions. Furthermore, ensure the QoS policies are effectively applied end-to-end across the network. This includes any QoS mapping between the wired and wireless networks. An example scenario is that an HDO decides to provide wireless guest access and wants assurance that guest access to the WLAN doesn’t interfere with patient data. The HDO already uses 802.11e QoS to segment traffic on the WLAN. Voice devices and MEDICAL DEVICES share the voice QoS category, while video traffic is assigned to the video category. The guest access SSID and associated devices are assigned to the best effort category and hence have a lower priority of access to the WLAN. If a device or group of devices does not support QoS, the HDO segments non-compliant devices into a separate band or subset of channels to provide a separation at the physical layer. 5.6 Receiver capabilities The SNR of a received signal is the ratio of the received signal power to the RF noise power at the receiver (see Figure 4). The minimum SNR for a device to operate at a certain data rate is the lowest SNR that enables reception and decoding of the received packet at a specified or maximum allowable packet error rate. Many factors are involved in determining a device’s SNR requirements, but, all other things being equal, the lower the SNR requirements of a device, the better it performs in degraded RF signal conditions. The minimum received signal strength of a device is a measure of the received signal power required for the device to properly decode the signal at a specified packet error rate. In the case of SNR, it is the “S” (desired signal strength) in SNR. In Figure 4, AP1 has a received signal strength of -65 dBm and an SNR of 30 dB. AP2 has received signal strength of -55 dBm and an SNR of 40 dB. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  21  Figure 4 – SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO 5.7 Received signal strength and SNR versus data rates As the received signal strength (RSSI) and attendant SNR decreases, the maximum data rate at which the receiver can successfully decode the signal also decreases. The SNR is the amount, or margin, of signal level above the receiver sensitivity threshold or noise floor (whichever is higher). Assuming a noise floor and receiver sensitivity of -88 dBm, for 802.11, an RSSI of -65 dBm and consequent SNR of 23 dB (88 – 65 = 23) generally allow a 36 Mbps data rate. At an RSSI of -82 dBm and same receiver sensitivity of -88 dBm, the consequent SNR of 6 means that the receiver might only support a data rate of 6 Mbps. However, a low data rate channel can allow successful reception of data with a weaker signal at longer distances from the AP. Similarly, a high density of devices, especially devices that require high data rates or very low error rates, require a high SNR. This is why applications or devices that use a lot of bandwidth (video streams) or require low packet error rates (real time traffic such as VOIP or streaming patient waveform data) has to be deployed in a high SNR environment. The RISK CONTROL measure of over-provisioning the network capacity is aligned with the concept of delivering the SNR required for the most effective data rate possible while simultaneously minimizing the effect of high AP signal levels on the overall background RF noise.  -55  SNR dBm  AP1 AP2 AP3  40 dB SNR  Noise Floor 30 dB -65 -95 IEC   1302/12 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201622  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 MEDICAL DEVICES support various communication protocols based on their design and purpose. Some of the common layer protocols that are encountered in a MEDICAL DEVICE are IP, TCP, UDP, and lower MAC layer protocols. Traffic types that can have differing impacts on the wireless performance and requirements are the various uses of UNICAST, MULTICAST and BROADCAST. A MEDICAL DEVICE can use multiple types of protocols, traffic types and other networking traffic functions in a single device. For example, a patient monitoring network can use BROADCAST traffic for communications setup, UNICAST traffic to talk between devices, and MULTICAST traffic to talk between multiple devices. Some vendors deliver BROADCAST/MULTICAST traffic as multiple UNICAST messages (one for each associated client) at an AP. This type of conversion can consume higher amounts of wireless network bandwidth. Vendors can also enhance the delivery of UNICAST messages only to clients that need to receive this message thereby limiting the amount of wireless channel bandwidth used while gaining reliable delivery of such messages at the same time. On the other hand, by default, BROADCAST and UNICAST messages are not acknowledged, so message delivery is not confirmed.  It is important to understand and design the network to support the delivery of all traffic types required by a MEDICAL DEVICE while ensuring that the medical traffic will coexist with network traffic from other network devices. The design needs to include the consideration of all data types and their communication protocol. For example, in an 802.11 network a specific MEDICAL DEVICE requires the use of MULTICAST, while a second MEDICAL DEVICE type specifies that MULTICAST traffic be minimized. When MULTICAST traffic is required, for example, if some devices or applications make use of MULTICAST traffic, the network designer should understand and enable proper IGMP versions and support across the network path. Because many times these devices have different MULTICAST requirements, the network design should logically isolate the devices appropriate methods. As mentioned earlier, the segmenting of traffic by SSID/VLAN is not considered best practice beyond a small amount of devices and SSIDs. Other, vendor specific mechanisms should be explored to isolate traffic on the wireless link. 5.8 Capacity versus coverage versus AP density Capacity, coverage and density are inter-related considerations in the design of a wireless network: – Capacity relates the available bandwidth to a specific geographical location. Capacity is affected not only by the density of wireless ACCESS POINTS, but also by the signal strength which is directly related to data rate. – Coverage typically is used to indicate that a wireless device can connect to the wireless network, without any connotation regarding available bandwidth. – Density of the AP deployment relates to both capacity and coverage, because the denser the deployment, the higher the available capacity (channel planning dependency aside) and RF signal coverage. Specifying the signal strength for a given coverage area is no longer sufficient for wireless network design. The capacity requirements for that area have to be considered and addressed by providing the required density of ACCESS POINTS. For example, a nursing station can have many wireless users in a small physical area. If these users and associated application(s) require the aggregate peak bandwidth of 45 Mbps, and a single 802.11 AP can deliver a “real world” throughput of approximately 15 Mbps, then a minimum of 3 ACCESS POINTS would be required in this physical area to support the application without considering the need to overprovision in terms of available capacity. An example of coverage compared to capacity is a DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEM connected to an 802.11 AP such that it provides extended coverage to an entire floor. If this is done with the use of multiple antennas and/or radiating coax, it can expose that AP to a large population of devices and users. In this example, it is likely that the capacity of that AP will be exceeded. Regardless AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  23 of whether a DAS is used or the AP manufacturer’s recommended antennas are used, it is important to correctly provision the number of APs in an area to achieve proper load balancing. Alternately, simply install the APs in a standard discrete deployment independent of the DAS. For the case of cellular coverage vs. capacity, the cellular service provider should review the quantity of devices to be enabled in the facility and plan accordingly with micro-cell or pico-cell installation(s). The HDO should work with a cellular provider in reviewing the types of devices and applications that will be operating on their network to ensure that sufficient capacity exists to support peak load conditions. 5.9 Deterministic versus non-deterministic wireless access protocol Deterministic access is such that devices are a-priori granted access to the network in predefined time slots, (i.e. allotted a dedicated fraction of total capacity). Non-deterministic access means that devices have to contend for the medium, and access to the network is not guaranteed. A deterministic protocol uses fixed time slots, making them inflexible regarding timing, so a burst of data has to wait for its time slot to transmit even if no other devices are using the medium. Proprietary protocols have the advantage of a turnkey solution managed by the vendor but this can also be a disadvantage, since an HDO might be locked into a particular vendor. Standards-based protocols generally have multiple vendors to choose from but require a higher degree of design, deployment and network management competency by the HDO. The use of deterministic versus non-deterministic protocols, standards-based vs. proprietary, or other unique attributes of protocols is dependent on both the available wireless technologies and the device requirements. A deterministic solution can provide a higher level of assurance in packet delivery, but less efficient use of the time domain. In a non-deterministic system, over-provisioning the network capacity is required. 5.10 Planning and design summary Defining the networking performance requirements of the MEDICAL DEVICE as used by the clinician and matching them to the capabilities of the wireless technologies available are key deliverables of the planning phase. Adhering to the guidelines as reviewed in this clause provides a strong foundation of RISK CONTROL measure for the actual design of a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. 6 Wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS: Deployment and configuration 6.1 RISKS versus benefit of a wireless communications system The RISKS for wireless communications systems have to be considered against the benefits, such as increased mobility of patients, devices and clinicians with faster access to data. Many RISKS are independent of which wireless solution is in place; rather, all wireless systems have inherent RISK due to relying upon a medium which is not constrained by a physical boundary. For example, while user authentication is required for both wired and wireless systems, the inability to ensure that an unauthorized user cannot access wireless data requires a different technical approach than would be taken on a wired LAN. Connections to wired LANs are generally unaffected by nearby construction and other electronic devices, while connections to wireless LANs can be greatly affected when signals are blocked by newly erected walls or other wireless devices create interference. One should consider that many wireless technologies exist beyond the wireless LAN. These include multiple WAN, PAN, and proprietary technologies, each of which exhibit desirable characteristics that a facility might wish to employ with networked MEDICAL DEVICES.

Cellular systems operate in licensed spectrum and are allowed to operate relatively interference-free from other sources. Unlicensed spectrum is governed by specific regulatory rules regarding interference from unintentional radiators, but the spectrum is neither limited to specific devices nor to wireless technologies. Devices that operate in unlicensed spectrum need to be able to co-exist with other types of devices, and accept a certain threshold of interference. All potential candidate bands of spectrum, regardless of licensed or unlicensed, should be evaluated at the HDOs facility for levels of interference from all sources. Additionally, the devices ability to operate in the presence of interference is a consideration during the wireless networks RISK ANALYSIS. 6.3 Interference sources  Applicable to both licensed and unlicensed spectrum usage, identifying interference sources (e.g. microwave ovens, two way radios, neighbor WLANs) is a challenging and critical factor to the performance of a wireless network; challenging in that identifying and managing an interfering source is difficult at best, and critical in that these interfering sources can cause a portion or the whole wireless network to fail for extended periods of time. Generally speaking, the use of unlicensed spectrum has a higher probability of interference. While interference sources are more likely in unlicensed spectrum, licensed spectrum is not immune from interference. A common source of interference in the 2,4 GHz band is microwave ovens. A policy of evaluating placement of microwave ovens near clinical areas where MEDICAL DEVICES operate is a RISK CONTROL measure. This evaluation includes testing for interference and using new model microwave ovens that have reduced RF emissions. More generally, the interference sources in and around an HDO should be known and considered as part of the wireless network RISK ANALYSIS. 6.4 Spectrum usage and allocation 6.4.1 Device coexistence If devices are coexisting in the same spectrum but using different wireless technologies, the systems have to have inherent mechanisms to avoid the impact of RF collisions (e.g. using RF energy detection and avoidance methods). Preferably the ability to segregate disparate wireless technologies sharing the same spectrum by means of physical location is preferred. Devices can coexist in the same physical space by operating in different parts of the spectrum (e.g. cellular bands versus WMTS versus unlicensed bands). However, many times this is impractical as many devices can operate in the same spectral band. If devices needs to coexist in the same physical space and the same spectral band (e.g. U-NII bands), then the next area to evaluate for proper deployment is the spectrum availability and usage. This might or might not require separate infrastructures. For coexistence on the same infrastructure, frequency separation by proper channel planning is a means of providing higher capacity without interference. Proper frequency planning, or channel management is essential to increasing capacity in a physical space. Advanced functions such as MIMO, beam-forming and smart antennas can provide more efficient spectral reuse and less interference, and if available should be evaluated in context of the requirements for the specific physical areas of deployment. The wireless network vendor and device manufacturers should be consulted to determine if they have validated these solutions. 6.4.2 Spectrum management Proper use of available spectrum is a cornerstone of successful wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK deployment. Preferably, the allocation of spectrum would be based on the network access priority and criticality of the device’s clinical requirements. For example, if two applications on the network degrade the RF performance of each other, the HDO should consider giving spectral preference to the higher priority application. An example is the deployment of 802.11 devices. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  25 Using the U-NII bands (5,150 – 5,875 GHz) in addition to using the 2.4 GHz bands and coherently separating devices across these bands based on priority and clinical use cases is a proper mechanism for deploying across all available spectra. Spectrum management requires an understanding of which wireless technologies are available and their characteristics. It also requires understanding which of these wireless technologies is in use within and around the HDO facility. With this understanding the HDO can properly determine where interference can exist. Using this information the physical and/or frequency separation of the clinical devices can be managed to mitigate the RISK of RF interference. If the devices need to coexist in the same physical space and share the same spectral bands, then the spectrum and channelization has to be properly deployed to provide adequate performance for meeting their INTENDED USE. Sometimes the use of different slices of spectrum around the HDO facility, especially by those that are not within the administrative control of the HDO, can change with time. Adapting to such changes in spectrum usage requires continuous monitoring of the RF environment, and taking corrective action when necessary to maintain unused or less-used slices of spectrum for critical HDO applications. 6.4.3 Capacity management Wireless spectrum is a finite resource that has to be shared amongst devices. As each device consumes spectrum and airtime to transmit and receive information, other devices have to wait their turn. Capacity management’s goal is to ensure that all devices can access the wireless infrastructure per their SLA. Some important examples of techniques for achieving required capacity are installing a sufficient number of wireless ACCESS POINTS and frequency reuse through proper channel planning. Managing and metering airtime for channel access across different traffic classes is another method to manage capacity and ensure SLAs are met. Exploring these types of options (some of which are proprietary) with the wireless networking vendor is an important part of the planning and design phase. 6.5 Wireless network configuration (802.11 specific) 6.5.1 General The configuration of the wireless LAN components determines the network’s ability to provide safe and effective communications.  6.5.2 VLAN and SSID The logical separation of devices using VLANs can provide isolation on the wired segment of the network. VLANs are mapped to the wireless network using SSIDs to extend the logical isolation to the wireless devices. This concept is a common practice with MEDICAL DEVICES to mitigate against undesirable and potentially incompatible network traffic, and to prevent unnecessary client power consumption that can result from receiving unwanted MULTICAST or BROADCAST traffic. Using SSIDs to logically separate devices is a means to provide unique services (e.g. security policy) to groups of devices, but has other consequences that needs to be understood during network design. The number of possible SSIDs is limited, especially when compared with the number of possible VLANs. Increasing the number of SSIDs on the same physical infrastructure increases the idle load (i.e. due to multiple beacon transmissions, etc.) on the wireless channels, decreasing the available capacity for critical data, and increasing complexity in WLAN management. As mentioned earlier, VLANs do not have additional cost on wired networks, but do present additional overhead on wireless links when VLANS are mapped, and thus require a unique SSID, to each WLAN on the wireless link. Each SSID will present additional idle load in the form of AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201626  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 beacons. Best practice dictates that they are both minimized and other methods of traffic separation, such as assigning WLANs to specific bands of spectrum (e.g. U-NII and ISM). 6.5.3 Authentication and encryption Wireless security provides protection from eavesdropping and from unauthorized network access. Ensure the minimum acceptable level of security is supported by the wireless technology and implement the highest level of security available. For example, due to a number of well-known vulnerabilities, it would not be recommended to use WEP as the security mechanism for patient data transport in an 802.11 network. TEMPORAL KEY INTEGRITY PROTOCOL (TKIP), the mechanism employed by the original WI-FI PROTECTED ACCESS (WPA) protocol, addresses the key shortcomings of WEP, however newer more preferred methods are now available. The Wi-Fi Alliance now recommends WPA2 / 802.11i, which uses ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) 1, as the minimum security capability. WPA2-Personal, which uses a PRE-SHARED KEY (PSK) requires the same key be used for all users, which can be limiting and logistically challenging. By contrast, WPA2-Enterprise allows a variety of flexible authentication mechanisms based on 802.1X EXTENSIBLE AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL (EAP) that can be different for each user or device.  For an 802.11 deployment, WPA2-Enterprise provides a greater level of security and access control than WPA2-PSK. There are a large number of specific EAP types that could be implemented in different devices, as well as supported on the network. Using an EAP solution that supports bi-directional certificates (server and client side) such as EAP-TLS is considered a stronger solution than username/password for client-side authentication, but imposes a potentially difficult challenge related to generating and maintaining a large number of client-side certificates. A RISK ANALYSIS should be used to determine if the actual use case requires the additional complexity of implementing bi-directional certificates. 6.5.4 Vendor proprietary extensions Many standards-based wireless technologies such as 802.11 have proprietary components. These proprietary functions might not be compatible with all devices and can have both positive and negative impact on performance of MEDICAL DEVICES. It is important to understand the operation of these functions as it relates to the networking performance characteristics of the MEDICAL DEVICES. Examples include mechanisms to support asset tracking and algorithms to set AP channel and transmit power. Engage with the wireless networking vendor to understand the impact of these proprietary functions so that the configuration of the network can optimally use proprietary extensions. 6.5.5 Cellular and proprietary networks Cellular and proprietary wireless networks are either managed by service providers or pre-configured where minimal or no networking oversight is required of the HDO. This includes the configuration and technical characteristics of wired networking devices such as switches (core, distribution and edge), routers (directing packets between LANs, or to a WAN, or to the Internet and/or to a cellular network), the security levels within the network and number of MEDICAL DEVICES that are part of the wired network. This technical report does not directly address the RISKS of a wired network, but they are related in that most or all wireless MEDICAL DEVICES eventually connect to the wired network for server access that typically have a wired network connection. As such, the wired network is part of the overall medical network system and should be considered systemically in overall network planning and design for ensuring the networks support clinical SLA of MEDICAL DEVICES. Although the HDO cannot be responsible for the detailed design, implementation and management of cellular and proprietary wireless networks, it should work with the network and service provider to define and ensure that the network meets an appropriate SLA. ___________ 1  http://www.wi-fi.org/files/kc/WPA-WPA2_Implementation_2-27-05v2.pdf AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  27 6.5.6 Network availability If data availability is critical, then the network has to be designed to quickly recover from component failures. Building in redundancy and resiliency to increase network availability can ensure that no single-fault failure stops the flow of data. For example, in a critical continuous patient monitoring application, if a router or WLAN controller fails, there should be an alternate path for data to flow from the patient to the clinician. Due to different RISK levels, the requirement for recovery speed might be different for life-critical data compared with general purpose data. Recovery times for different backup solutions can vary from several seconds to several minutes. The best backup solution to use depends on cost of implementation and probability of occurrence of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (e.g. patient experiences an arrhythmia during the time required for network recovery).  A RISK ANALYSIS is used to determine if a faster and more expensive backup recovery solution should be put in place. In the wireless or RF space, the use of overlapping coverage provides a mechanism for high network availability. As discussed in 6.4, proper use of RF channels allows for use of RF redundancy. For example, the 2.4 GHz ISM BAND has 83 MHz of spectrum, while the  5 GHz U-NII bands provide up to 555 MHz of spectrum. In the case of 802.11 in the USA, this translates to 3 available non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz spectrum and up to 24 non-overlapping channels in the U-NII spectrum. Due to the small number of distinct channels in the 2.4 GHz band, it is not feasible to overlap coverage in a large physical space where high capacity is required using 2.4 GHz. The higher number of available channels in the  5 GHz U-NII bands allows for RF coverage overlap and thus RF redundancy, which translates into high wireless network availability. 6.6 VERIFICATION testing 6.6.1 General The use of network VERIFICATION testing is an industry best practice that is directly applicable to successfully deploying and operating a wireless network. Network testing discovers errors not only in 1) the network hardware or firmware, or 2) INTEROPERABILITY between the device and the infrastructure, but also in 3) the design, topology, and configuration of the network which is owned by the network designer/maintainer. There will always be variance from one network to another, and neither the MDM nor the IT equipment manufacturer has complete visibility into the design and day-to-day operation of a hospital-unique network. In terms of the design, deployment and configuration of a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, VERIFICATION testing is a necessary task. Many HDOs do not have the facilities to support the creation of a lab network to perform VERIFICATION testing. Segmenting a portion of the live network so that it can serve as a test bed without connecting devices to actual patients can be an appropriate alternative. Providing full access to the implementation team (IT, biomed, clinicians, etc.) during the VERIFICATION testing is important, and the ability to test devices and systems on the actual network is of great value. 6.6.2 Pre GO-LIVE VERIFICATION testing The use of a lab environment to emulate and VERIFY the performance of both MEDICAL DEVICES and non-MEDICAL DEVICES on a WLAN is an important component of RISK CONTROL measures. While the lab testing will give a good indication of overall performance, it cannot replace testing on the actual MEDICAL IT-NETWORK environment, as the lab environment only approximates the actual environment. In addition, VERIFICATION should also include testing to confirm that the network is available as designed when individual network components go off-line. 6.6.3 GO-LIVE VERIFICATION testing After isolated VERIFICATION testing, the network changes are tested in the actual environment. Preparation for testing involves creating an installation plan to move to the new solution which includes a personnel support plan (e.g. extra staff available) in case the upgrade fails or includes AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201628  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 network downtime2). This involves the support of IT, clinicians and biomedical engineering to trial the MEDICAL DEVICES on the live network. Device and network configurations, expected down time, extra support personnel and actual use by clinicians should all be part of the installation plan for GO-LIVE VERIFICATION testing. For large deployments, a staged release after successful testing might be warranted. For example, a multi-floor system might be rolled out one floor at a time.  7 Wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS: Management and support 7.1 General This clause provides an overview of RISK CONTROL measures and best practices associated with managing a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK after deployment and configuration.  7.2 Network and application management Once the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK is planned, deployed, and VERIFIED, use network and application management tools to monitor and mitigate wireless network performance degradation events and outages. A RISK ANALYSIS should be used to define the required scope and scale of network monitoring tools or capabilities. Simple RISK CONTROL measures such as SNMP traps to large scale third party enterprise tools should be considered. The goal should be to identify performance degradation before it actually manifests as a HAZARDOUS SITUATION or HARM. The use of network monitoring on the wireless and wired infrastructure(s) combined with application layer monitoring can provide insight into the real time performance of the network. Monitoring can also provide alerts of low capacity or other issues that might degrade the network’s ability to meet the required SLAs 7.3 Policies and procedures Define, document and distribute strong policies and procedures regarding the use of both the wireless network and RF environment. Policies should focus on the restricted (by location perhaps) use of wireless or other devices that might interfere with devices on the HDO wireless network. Examples include: – the location of where personal communication devices, such as cellular phones, Bluetooth headsets, DECT or other cordless phones can be used; – the prohibition of individual or group use of rogue wireless network devices such as 802.11 APs; – determining the physical placement and/or replacement (e.g. with models that generate lower levels of RF emissions/interference) of HDO assets that might be interference sources such as microwave ovens, electrosurgery equipment, etc. Document the procedures that outline the PROCESS of approving the connection of a wireless device to the network. A policy should define the requirement that any purchases of wireless devices include the review of IT staff as part of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION before the purchase is made. Policies should be clearly posted for guest users as well as internally distributed. ___________ 2) The 10-step RISK ANALYSIS process described in IEC 80001-2-1:2012 provides a template that can be used to define roles and responsibilities during network upgrades. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  29 7.4 Change control Awareness and understanding of the potential impact on the performance of MEDICAL DEVICES from changes in a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK allows RISK MANAGEMENT to be applied to the change control PROCESS. Examples of changes include changing the wireless controller software versions, applying software patches, or changing the configuration of a networking component (note that some wireless network management systems will automatically change networking device parameters.) As an example, updating wireless controller firmware to support a security patch might fix an issue with security, but cause problems elsewhere in the network as a result of the introduction of a software defect in the new controller software. A hardware example would be the upgrade of an AP from 802.11abg to 802.11abgn. In all of these instances, the use of pre GO-LIVE VERIFICATION testing as part of a change control PROCESS, as described in 6.6, is recommended. Upgrading to a release of network infrastructure hardware or software without consulting with the MDM is not recommended. Early releases of software have a higher probability of performance issues. It is recommended to check with the MDM to determine if any VERIFICATION testing of their devices and the wireless infrastructure software version in review has been completed. It is important to note that with the proliferation of hardware and software versions available from both the network infrastructure vendors as well as the MDM, it is probable that not all combinations will be tested prior to the roll-out of a specific combination at an HDO. If the desired combination has not yet been tested, the HDO should complete their own VERIFICATION. As the release of some hardware, software and firmware updates by wireless network vendors is generally not scheduled (e.g. security updates), the MDM might not be able to complete validation in a time requested by the HDO. The HDO should consider in their RISK ANALYSIS the RISKS of running wireless networking software that has not been tested for INTEROPERABILITY by MDMs. If neither is acceptable, the HDO should complete testing for VERIFICATION. Changes to the physical environment will affect the RF coverage. The use of site surveys or RF management tools to validate the RF coverage after any environmental changes is a key RISK CONTROL measure. Examples include the renovation of units or floor plans where wireless is used for MEDICAL DEVICES. Adding new applications, medical or non-medical, can impact the performance of existing networked devices in a shared wireless environment with finite available bandwidth. Examples are enabling WLAN guest access and the addition of asset tracking / location devices. 8 General RISK CONTROL measures 8.1 General The previous clauses outlined a PROCESS by which a wireless MEDICAL IT-NETWORK can be planned, designed, deployed and managed. Clearly every network is different including the use of different technologies and vendor solutions. This final clause will review some RISK CONTROL measures that can be applicable to a specific technology or HDO. It also provides a summary of some of the inherent best design practices covered in previous clauses. When determining the list of unique causes unique to an HDO, this clause’s listing of RISK CONTROL measures should be reviewed for applicability and might assist in filling RISK ANALYSIS gaps. 8.2 Determining baseline networking performance Understanding the performance characteristics of a wireless technology and matching them to the performance requirements of the networked devices are vital to ensuring the proper deployment of MEDICAL DEVICES on a wireless infrastructure. A grouping of devices is one where all the devices share the same network performance capabilities and requirements. Categorizing each grouping of performance requirements into AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201630  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 specific wireless performance characteristics, including WLAN configurations, is a recommended method of defining each group. One should design the wireless network to match the requirements of the most stringent performance characteristics of the devices for each grouping, thus inherently meeting the SLA of less demanding devices in terms of networking performance. 8.3 Designing for coverage signal strength It is a good rule of thumb when using wireless technologies such as 802.11 to deploy the wireless infrastructure such that its minimum RSSI and SNR in the intended coverage area is above the MEDICAL DEVICE'S specified receiver sensitivity and SNR for its highest supported data rate. RF signals in a real-world environment such as a hospital can vary in signal strength by 10 dB while standing still and experience fading (reduced signal due to multipath effects) of 20 dB or more. Thus if a devices receiver sensitivity for the highest data rate possible is -75 dBm (or 20 dB SNR if noise floor equals -95 dBm), then the wireless network design might need to provide coverage at -65 dBm. Another view is to measure the RF noise floor in the wireless coverage area over a period of time to identify worst case scenarios, and reduce the transmit power of the wireless APs, and/or space the APs closer, such that the received signal strength of the MEDICAL DEVICE exceeds the highest data rate receiver sensitivity by a margin of at least 10 dB. Refer to Figure 4 for a graphical representation of SNR. 8.4 Segregating traffic and data types As a typical best practice, networks are logically segmented to isolate (e.g. use of VLANs) BROADCAST traffic to its intended domain or subnet. This same best practice, when traffic types can be clearly identified, can be used to separate life-critical data from general purpose IT traffic. After identification of the clinical use of a MEDICAL DEVICE and associated traffic (e.g. life critical, data archiving, etc.), determine the MEDICAL DEVICE supported communication protocols, addressing modes (UNICAST, MULTICAST, BROADCAST), and other protocol usage information. Create VLAN(s) on the wired link for different classes of MEDICAL DEVICES and clinical data and then map the wireless MEDICAL DEVICES to the proper VLAN (e.g. for WI-FI the SSID is mapped to a specific VLAN). 8.5 Environmental and physical changes  Physical changes in the wireless environment (e.g. floor plan changes) will impact the RF performance of wireless devices. Obstructing or altering the RF signal path can have a significant performance impact on a device’s wireless link. A potential RISK CONTROL measure would be to evaluate all physical structure changes in a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK environment for adequate RSSI and SNR and test after any changes. Move or install additional wireless infrastructure (e.g. APs) as determined by an RF site survey or other means. 8.6 Maintaining a clean RF environment It is a challenge for the HDO to keep the RF environment clean on its existing and managed wireless network(s). Outside interference from neighboring networks, microwave ovens, other users of unlicensed spectrum (Bluetooth, DECT phones, Zigbee, etc.) can intermittently appear in the HDOs managed RF space. Periodic surveys of the coverage area using spectrum analysis tools to scan and identify sources of interference is one way to mitigate against unknown and unmanaged interferers. Define and document policies that remove or restrict the use of interfering sources (by location if possible). Another potential way to mitigate against interference is to dedicate the least congested channels to MEDICAL DEVICES, whether they be in licensed or unlicensed bands.

In terms of probability, usage is typically a Poisson-distributed random PROCESS and can also include spatial-temporal variance. The difficulty in quantifying the precise load is part of the reason for provisioning the network with significant margin (e.g. designing with fifty percent more capacity than required for the expected usage). If the network is a proprietary network, management of capacity might be built-in (e.g. in a channelized wireless telemetry system). A RISK CONTROL measure against an overloaded network is to test and VERIFY the actual impact introduced by changes to networking equipment and wireless network clients. Gather both the MDM and wireless infrastructure provider’s performance specifications to understand capacity requirements of devices and applications versus coverage area capacity. One way to envision coverage area capacity is to think of the available bandwidth (Mbps) per unit area of floor space. As an example, consider a 1,000 m2 hospital floor. During the planning and design phase it is determined that the combined peak capacity requirements of all devices (medical and non-medical) is 100 Mbps, or 100 Kbps/m2 (100 Mbps spread across entire floor equals 100 Kbps per square meter). It is also determined that the nursing station is considered the highest capacity user per physical area, and the nursing station area will require a peak capacity of 130 Kbps/m2. During the planning phase, 802.11 is the chosen wireless technology, and the 802.11 dual band AP is expected to deliver a “real world” capacity of 20 Mbps in the 802.11a 5 GHz U-NII bands, and 6 Mbps in the 802.11bg 2,4 GHz ISM BAND. The network designer chooses to deploy enough APs to meet the nursing station capacity requirements across the entire floor (an alternate plan would be to add additional AP(s) only in the nursing station area). Extending the 130 Kbps/m2 requirement across the entire floor, and designing to overprovision the WLAN by 50 %, the WLAN coverage design requires an aggregate capacity of 260 Kbps/m2, or 260 Mbps. The deployment meets this requirement with the use of 10 APs (200 Mbps for 802.11a and 60 Mbps in 802.11bg). Assuming that devices are deployed and configured (e.g. channel assignments, etc.) to utilize the two bands effectively and the RF coverage of the APs is confirmed with an RF survey tool, the deployment design is appropriate and would be ready for test and VERIFICATION. 8.7.2 5 GHz and DYNAMIC FREQUENCY SELECTION (DFS) Each country has its own rules and regulations regarding the use of unlicensed spectrum. The channels available and secondary use of the spectrum can change from one country to another. For example, some of the 5 GHz channels are restricted in areas where they might interfere with radar systems that operate on a primary usage basis in the band. An HDO can investigate with the proper local government authorities to learn if there are any radar installations in the vicinity of the facility. Additionally, any infrastructure device such as an 802.11 AP that operates on a DFS channel is required to monitor for radar and avoid interfering transmissions if a radar source is detected. Most APs or WLANs will alert or provide logs showing that they have detected radar and activated their DFS system. Once it is known that there are radar installations in the vicinity, the affected 802.11 channels might need to be manually disabled. This is because DFS will cause the AP to cease operation on the affected channel, and any clients connected to the AP might be disassociated and experience a loss of connectivity for a significant period of time (seconds to minutes depending on the client behavior) until they can reconnect to the same or a neighboring AP on an unaffected channel. 8.7.3 Security measures and planning For additional information on securing wireless communications, please refer to security RISK ASSESSMENT standards such as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO/IEC 27002:2005, ISO/IEC 15408-2:2008, etc. Wireless communication technologies include many technical AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201632  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 security controls, please refer to the specification for each technology, (e.g. 802.11, Bluetooth, etc.). For guidance regarding security RISKS in connecting MEDICAL DEVICES to IT-NETWORKS please see IEC/TR 80001-2-2 on of MEDICAL DEVICE security needs, RISKS and controls. Security was already a strategic and important focus for IT NETWORKS before the introduction of MEDICAL DEVICES. Protected health information on any network demands strong security measures; this is especially true for wireless networks. As part of the design and planning of the WLAN, each link in the communication chain should be evaluated for security flaws and appropriate counter measures. Use strong encryption and authentication solutions such as AES and 802.1X. In addition, the use of IDS/IPS might be warranted to detect and protect against many of the wireless intrusion mechanisms. If legacy devices that support lesser levels of encryption have to be allowed on the network, the design should restrict the network access of these devices. For example, infusion pumps that have lesser means of security might only have access to a single formulary update server so that RISK of a network breach is restricted to the single server. 8.8 RF spectrum use Although available spectrum is a limited and valuable resource, proper planning and use of the RF spectrum by the HDO is often overlooked. The RISK ANALYSIS should include consideration of all spectrum and associated wireless technologies available to the HDO. Considerations include the nature and probability of interference, the support for peak traffic loads, and the ability of the technology to operate in the presence of expected interference sources. In most locations, licensed spectrum has a lower probability of interference than unlicensed spectrum; however, some providers of licensed spectrum (e.g. cellular) design for average loads, not peak loads. In the case of unlicensed spectrum, the use of less crowded or higher bandwidth spectrum is recommended. For example, a capacity analysis might indicate use of the U-NII bands (5 GHz) with 555 MHz of bandwidth over the use of the ISM 2.4 GHz band with only 83 MHz of bandwidth. Each band of spectrum has pro’s and con’s that should be vetted against the wireless RF requirements. For example, the RISK ANALYSIS should consider whether the HDO should use the U-NII band DFS channels as radar interfering events can lead to temporary loss of communications and other performance degradation due to secondary network perturbations when the affected APs all suddenly change channels. 8.9 Device and application classification When disparate devices with varying performance requirements coexist on the same network, the use of classification on the network by security policy and performance requirements is helpful in managing network access. In the case of MEDICAL DEVICES where network performance and availability can have patient SAFETY implications, the ability to classify the wireless MEDICAL DEVICES as higher priority on the network at the access layer is even more important and vital. Selecting wireless technologies and infrastructure solutions that are able to distinguish and manage packet transmissions of different priorities should be considered.  Such QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) mechanisms should be explored in the design and planning phases and implemented end-to-end on the network. Mechanisms that also allow for detection and prevention of misuse of QoS tags to gain unfair access to wireless bandwidth should also be considered. For example, a low priority packet gets tagged as a high priority packet and gets preferred treatment that it doesn’t deserve. This can impact SLAs for the high-priority traffic. Detection and prevention of such misuse can help meet SLAs. Consult with your wireless network infrastructure provider to explore these types of capabilities.

For example, guest users should be bandwidth limited such that their particular classes of devices only receive minimal bandwidth while reserving most of the bandwidth for mission and life critical applications. Even with MEDICAL DEVICES or medical smart phone applications, the clinical functionality of “how” the application is used has to be considered as part of the system level design. If a physician wants to use his or her smart phone for non-medical use while in the HDO then the traffic from that device should be segregated either within the guest access SSID or a separate dedicated SSID to smart phone applications. Regardless, the device and the applications that reside on it need to be understood regarding the clinical functionality and properly accounted for in the RISK ANALYSIS and design. The use of limiting the bandwidth to a particular device or application needs to take into account the clinical functionality and not necessarily the user’s preferences for broadband access. If higher levels of broadband access are needed to support guest access and smart phone applications, then other means of design RISK CONTROL measures might be necessary. Examples of such are considered in this technical report, such as the increase in the number of APs and expanded use of the 5 GHz spectrum. 8.11 WLAN infrastructure configuration An HDO MEDICAL IT-NETWORK administrator can expect to have to alter or create some level of customization in the wireless infrastructure configuration. Most wireless infrastructure solutions include extensive manuals and sets of best practices. Appropriate personnel should undertake the necessary training to learn the capabilities of the wireless network and how to properly configure the system for peak performance and availability. Once the configurations are understood, they can be matched to the networking performance requirements of the devices on the MEDICAL IT NETWORK. This includes networking performance characteristics such as latency and packet loss, security posture and any configuration to enable compatibility between the MEDICAL DEVICES and the wireless network. Meeting the SLAs of all devices is a task that will require tradeoffs based on clinical priority, resources, and budgets, all of which should be considered as part of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. 8.12 External partnering with both MEDICAL DEVICE and networking manufacturer Developing a relationship with the MDM as well as the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK provider is now an important aspect of designing and maintaining a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Work with both the wireless networking provider and MDM to understand the infrastructure and device level requirements and capabilities, and review device and WLAN network configurations with all interested parties. Ideally the parameters are formalized in the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS. After review and acceptance of a proposed configuration by all responsible parties, a testing of the WLAN and device(s) configurations in a laboratory environment to evaluate compatibility and measure performance is an integral part of the RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS. Note that this is complementary with the internal partnering required within the HDO including biomedical engineers, safety officers, clinicians and risk managers. 8.13 Redundancy Redundancy is a best practice implemented in wired networks and wireless networks. Deploying the wireless network so that each area is covered by at least two transceivers on different channels provides RF redundancy. This deployment strategy is only possible when sufficient channels are available. Further, if these transceivers are wired to different network switch fabrics, then a single switch failure will not result in loss of all wireless functionality.   For example, if using 802.11 operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM BAND, there are, at best depending on the regulatory domain, three distinct 802.11 frequency channels available. In a physical space where there are many overlapping AP coverage areas, lack of distinct channels can lead to increased co-channel interference. Implementing RF redundancy in this scenario will result in a decrease in overall capacity. A mitigation technique is to move critical traffic to the U-NII 5 GHz AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201634  © 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012 bands where up to twenty four distinct 802.11 channels are available. In conjunction with this larger number of distinct channels, physically overlapping AP coverage areas provide enhanced capacity as well as RF redundancy when properly deployed. As more APs are added, the AP and client transmit power can also be decreased to support extremely dense AP deployments. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2012 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-3:2012  35 Annex A  (informative)  Clinical use cases and network traffic profiles  The following table provides example clinical use cases and shows associated mapping onto network traffic profiles. It is intended to provide a framework by which IT professionals might define specific clinical use cases per their HDO and map them onto their overall network design and implementation plan. It is important to understand that the actual clinical use case can dramatically alter the severity of failure shown in the examples below, which then can affect the networking traffic profile. As an example, a VOIP phone used for general communications only warrants a priority of medium, but once that phone is used for alerting or alarming to patient condition and events, the priority increases to high. Table A.1 is for reference purposes only, as a MEDICAL DEVICE can have many different clinical and networking profiles and this table is not considered representative for all MEDICAL DEVICE use cases. It is important to note that the detailed traffic characteristics (e.g. packet size and timing) vs. average load of a device or application is also a critical factor in determining the network performance requirements. For example, VOIP using the G.711 CODEC has a bandwidth of 64 kbps which is near the “low” bandwidth category. However, because of the fact that it uses a 50 packets per second packet rate, the impact on the overall network throughput is considerably larger. Thus in some instances such as VOIP traffic, understanding and planning for the higher network throughput requirements associated with high packet rates should be part of the network performance consideration during its design.

This annex should be considered as guidance towards establishing a specific set of parametric data that can be used to define a RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS. Network 1) Does the HDO prefer one network per application or one network that supports multiple applications? a) If there is one application per network, how will the multiple networks be managed? b) If one converged network, then what technological solution supports the most applications on one network? How will competing interests for use of the same network be resolved? 2) How will required network availability be ensured (e.g. does topology support mitigation in the case of single-fault failures for both wireless and wired LAN segments)?  3) How does the network topology support scalability and how does it affect mobility of devices (e.g. different subnets for different floors or buildings)? 4) What aggregate load impinges each network appliance and are the uplink/downlink capacities sufficient?  5) What laboratory and clinical testing has been done that is applicable? 6) What is the network latency and does it satisfy the requirements of the devices and applications? 7) What is the network jitter and does it satisfy the requirements of the devices and applications? 8) What QoS solutions exist? 9) What level of data reliability will the installed network support? 10) What is the maximum number of devices, packets per second, and throughput an individual AP can support and for what data rate are these maxima defined? 11) What is the vendor’s recommended maximum number of devices, packets per second, and throughput an individual AP should support at the HDO’s worst-case data rate?  For the overall system? Note that the WLAN vendor and different MDMs might have different maximum limits. Preferably, the MDM and WLAN vendors provide rationale for these limits, such as “maximum load determined to be reliable.” When different vendors each have recommendations for maximum load, the minimum of these should be followed. 12) What is the maximum bandwidth that an individual AP should support for the expected type and number of clients associated with that AP? For the overall system?

How is it documented? 23) How is the site survey documented? How can it be compared to RF coverage in the future?  24) How can changes in the RF performance of the network be monitored over time and how robust is the wireless network in managing changes in the environment? Do the end devices actively assist and cooperate in the adaptation of network adaptation mechanisms? 25) What training is available?  Has the vendor(s) provided appropriate training to properly manage, configure and utilize the wireless network? 26) Are there any applications that dynamically affect the AP operation, e.g. running an AP as a network sniffer, using an AP for asset tracking, off-channel scanning? 27) What channels will be used and how is the AP channel set allocated? 28) What AP transmit power is used for typical use and for the site survey?

National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO/IEC 27002 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques. This first edition of ISO/IEC 27002 comprises ISO/IEC 17799:2005 and ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007. Its technical content is identical to that of ISO/IEC 17799:2005. ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007 changes the reference number of the standard from 17799 to 27002.

viii © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO/IEC 17799 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 17799:2000), which has been technically revised.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved ix    0 Introduction 0.1 What is information security? Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an organization’s business and consequently needs to be suitably protected.  This is especially important in the increasingly interconnected business environment.  As a result of this increasing interconnectivity, information is now exposed to a growing number and a wider variety of threats and vulnerabilities (see also OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks).    Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically, transmitted by post or by using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation. Whatever form the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always be appropriately protected.  Information security is the protection of information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business continuity, minimize business risk, and maximize return on investments and business opportunities.  Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. These controls need to be established, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved, where necessary, to ensure that the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. This should be done in conjunction with other business management processes. 0.2 Why information security is needed? Information and the supporting processes, systems, and networks are important business assets.  Defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security may be essential to maintain competitive edge, cash flow, profitability, legal compliance, and commercial image.  Organizations and their information systems and networks are faced with security threats from a wide range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, espionage, sabotage, vandalism, fire or flood.  Causes of damage such as malicious code, computer hacking, and denial of service attacks have become more common, more ambitious, and increasingly sophisticated.  Information security is important to both public and private sector businesses, and to protect critical infrastructures. In both sectors, information security will function as an enabler, e.g. to achieve e-government or e-business, and to avoid or reduce relevant risks.  The interconnection of public and private networks and the sharing of information resources increase the difficulty of achieving access control. The trend to distributed computing has also weakened the effectiveness of central, specialist control.  Many information systems have not been designed to be secure. The security that can be achieved through technical means is limited, and should be supported by appropriate management and procedures. Identifying which controls should be in place requires careful planning and attention to detail. Information security management requires, as a minimum, participation by all employees in the organization. It may also require participation from shareholders, suppliers, third parties, customers or other external parties. Specialist advice from outside organizations may also be needed.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) x © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved  0.3 How to establish security requirements It is essential that an organization identifies its security requirements. There are three main sources of security requirements.  1. One source is derived from assessing risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment, threats to assets are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential impact is estimated.  2. Another source is the legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements that an organization, its trading partners, contractors, and service providers have to satisfy, and their socio-cultural environment.  3. A further source is the particular set of principles, objectives and business requirements for information processing that an organization has developed to support its operations. 0.4 Assessing security risks Security requirements are identified by a methodical assessment of security risks. Expenditure on controls needs to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security failures.   The results of the risk assessment will help to guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks, and for implementing controls selected to protect against these risks.   Risk assessment should be repeated periodically to address any changes that might influence the risk assessment results.  More information about the assessment of security risks can be found in clause 4.1 “Assessing security risks”.  0.5 Selecting controls Once security requirements and risks have been identified and decisions for the treatment of risks have been made, appropriate controls should be selected and implemented to ensure risks are reduced to an acceptable level. Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet specific needs as appropriate. The selection of security controls is dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk acceptance, risk treatment options, and the general risk management approach applied to the organization, and should also be subject to all relevant national and international legislation and regulations.   Some of the controls in this standard can be considered as guiding principles for information security management and applicable for most organizations. They are explained in more detail below under the heading “Information security starting point”.  More information about selecting controls and other risk treatment options can be found in clause 4.2 "Treating security risks". 0.6 Information security starting point A number of controls can be considered as a good starting point for implementing information security. They are either based on essential legislative requirements or considered to be common practice for information security. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved xi   a) data protection and privacy of personal information (see 15.1.4);  b) safeguarding of organizational records (see 15.1.3); c) intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2). Controls considered to be common practice for information security include:  a) information security policy document (see 5.1.1); b) allocation of information security responsibilities (see 6.1.3); c) information security awareness, education, and training (see 8.2.2); d) correct processing in applications (see 12.2); e) vulnerability management (see 12.6);  f) business continuity management (see 14); g) management of information security incidents and improvements (see 13.2).  These controls apply to most organizations and in most environments.   It should be noted that although all controls in this standard are important and should be considered, the relevance of any control should be determined in the light of the specific risks an organization is facing. Hence, although the above approach is considered a good starting point, it does not replace selection of controls based on a risk assessment. 0.7 Critical success factors Experience has shown that the following factors are often critical to the successful implementation of information security within an organization:  a) information security policy, objectives, and activities that reflect business objectives; b) an approach and framework to implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and improving information security that is consistent with the organizational culture;  c) visible support and commitment from all levels of management; d) a good understanding of the information security requirements, risk assessment, and risk management; e) effective marketing of information security to all managers, employees, and other parties to achieve awareness; f) distribution of guidance on information security policy and standards to all managers, employees and other parties; g) provision to fund information security management activities; h) providing appropriate awareness, training, and education; i) establishing an effective information security incident management process; j) implementation of a measurement1 system that is used to evaluate performance in information security management and feedback suggestions for improvement.                                                            1 Note that information security measurements are outside of the scope of this standard.  Controls considered to be essential to an organization from a legislative point of view include, depending on applicable legislation: ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) xii © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved   0.8 Developing your own guidelines This code of practice may be regarded as a starting point for developing organization specific guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice may be applicable. Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this standard may be required. When documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it may be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this standard where applicable to facilitate compliance checking by auditors and business partners.  FINAL DRAFT INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 1 Information technology — Security techniques — Code of practice for information security management  1 Scope This International Standard establishes guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization.

Also, all lists in this standard are not in priority order unless so noted. 3.2 Main security categories Each main security category contains: a) a control objective stating what is to be achieved; and b) one or more controls that can be applied to achieve the control objective.  Control descriptions are structured as follows: Control  Defines the specific control statement to satisfy the control objective.  Implementation guidance Provides more detailed information to support the implementation of the control and meeting the control objective.  Some of this guidance may not be suitable in all cases and so other ways of implementing the control may be more appropriate.  Other information Provides further information that may need to be considered, for example legal considerations and references to other standards.

The results should guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect against these risks. The process of assessing risks and selecting controls may need to be performed a number of times to cover different parts of the organization or individual information systems.  Risk assessment should include the systematic approach of estimating the magnitude of risks (risk analysis) and the process of comparing the estimated risks against risk criteria to determine the significance of the risks (risk evaluation).  Risk assessments should also be performed periodically to address changes in the security requirements and in the risk situation, e.g. in the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, the risk evaluation, and when significant changes occur. These risk assessments should be undertaken in a methodical manner capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.  The information security risk assessment should have a clearly defined scope in order to be effective and should include relationships with risk assessments in other areas, if appropriate.  The scope of a risk assessment can be either the whole organization, parts of the organization, an individual information system, specific system components, or services where this is practicable, realistic, and helpful. Examples of risk assessment methodologies are discussed in ISO/IEC TR 13335-3 (Guidelines for the Management of IT Security: Techniques for the Management of IT Security). 4.2 Treating security risks Before considering the treatment of a risk, the organization should decide criteria for determining whether or not risks can be accepted. Risks may be accepted if, for example, it is assessed that the risk is low or that the cost of treatment is not cost-effective for the organization. Such decisions should be recorded.   For each of the risks identified following the risk assessment a risk treatment decision needs to be made.   Possible options for risk treatment include:  a) applying appropriate controls to reduce the risks; b) knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the organization’s policy and criteria for risk acceptance; c) avoiding risks by not allowing actions that would cause the risks to occur; d) transferring the associated risks to other parties, e.g. insurers or suppliers.    For those risks where the risk treatment decision has been to apply appropriate controls, these controls should be selected and implemented to meet the requirements identified by a risk assessment. Controls should ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level taking into account:  a) requirements and constraints of national and international legislation and regulations; b) organizational objectives; c) operational requirements and constraints; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 5 d) cost of implementation and operation in relation to the risks being reduced, and remaining proportional to the organization’s requirements and constraints; e) the need to balance the investment in implementation and operation of controls against the harm likely to result from security failures. Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet the specific needs of the organization. It is necessary to recognize that some controls may not be applicable to every information system or environment, and might not be practicable for all organizations. As an example, 10.1.3 describes how duties may be segregated to prevent fraud and error. It may not be possible for smaller organizations to segregate all duties and other ways of achieving the same control objective may be necessary. As another example, 10.10 describes how system use can be monitored and evidence collected. The described controls e.g. event logging, might conflict with applicable legislation, such as privacy protection for customers or in the workplace.  Information security controls should be considered at the systems and projects requirements specification and design stage. Failure to do so can result in additional costs and less effective solutions, and maybe, in the worst case, inability to achieve adequate security.  It should be kept in mind that no set of controls can achieve complete security, and that additional management action should be implemented to monitor, evaluate, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security controls to support the organization’s aims.      ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 6 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 5 Security policy 5.1 Information security policy Objective: To provide management direction and support for information security in accordance with business requirements and relevant laws and regulations. Management should set a clear policy direction in line with business objectives and demonstrate support for, and commitment to, information security through the issue and maintenance of an information security policy across the organization. 5.1.1 Information security policy document Control An information security policy document should be approved by management, and published and communicated to all employees and relevant external parties.  Implementation guidance The information security policy document should state management commitment and set out the organization’s approach to managing information security. The policy document should contain statements concerning:  a) a definition of information security, its overall objectives and scope and the importance of security as an enabling mechanism for information sharing (see introduction); b) a statement of management intent, supporting the goals and principles of information security in line with the business strategy and objectives; c) a framework for setting control objectives and controls, including the structure of risk assessment and risk management; d) a brief explanation of the security policies, principles, standards, and compliance requirements of particular importance to the organization, including: 1) compliance with legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements; 2) security education, training, and awareness requirements; 3) business continuity management; 4) consequences of information security policy violations; e) a definition of general and specific responsibilities for information security management, including reporting information security incidents; f) references to documentation which may support the policy, e.g. more detailed security policies and procedures for specific information systems or security rules users should comply with. This information security policy should be communicated throughout the organization to users in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader.    Other information The information security policy might be a part of a general policy document. If the information security policy is distributed outside the organisation, care should be taken not to disclose sensitive information. Further information can be found in the ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.    ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 7 5.1.2 Review of the information security policy Control The information security policy should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes occur to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.   Implementation guidance The information security policy should have an owner who has approved management responsibility for the development, review, and evaluation of the security policy.  The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information security policy and approach to managing information security in response to changes to the organizational environment, business circumstances, legal conditions, or technical environment.   The review of the information security policy should take account of the results of management reviews.  There should be defined management review procedures, including a schedule or period of the review.  The input to the management review should include information on:  a) feedback from interested parties; b) results of independent reviews (see 6.1.8); c) status of preventive and corrective actions (see 6.1.8 and 15.2.1); d) results of previous management reviews; e) process performance and information security policy compliance; f) changes that could affect the organization’s approach to managing information security, including changes to the organizational environment, business circumstances, resource availability, contractual, regulatory, and legal conditions, or to the technical environment; g) trends related to threats and vulnerabilities; h) reported information security incidents (see 13.1);  i) recommendations provided by relevant authorities (see 6.1.6).  The output from the management review should include any decisions and actions related to:  a) improvement of the organization’s approach to managing information security and its processes; b) improvement of control objectives and controls; c) improvement in the allocation of resources and/or responsibilities.  A record of the management review should be maintained.   Management approval for the revised policy should be obtained.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 8 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 6 Organizing information security 6.1 Internal organization Objective: To manage information security within the organization. A management framework should be established to initiate and control the implementation of information security within the organization. Management should approve the information security policy, assign security roles and co-ordinate and review the implementation of security across the organization.  If necessary, a source of specialist information security advice should be established and made available within the organization. Contacts with external security specialists or groups, including relevant authorities, should be developed to keep up with industrial trends, monitor standards and assessment methods and provide suitable liaison points when handling information security incidents. A multi-disciplinary approach to information security should be encouraged. 6.1.1 Management commitment to information security Control Management should actively support security within the organization through clear direction, demonstrated commitment, explicit assignment, and acknowledgment of information security responsibilities.  Implementation guidance Management should:  a) ensure that information security goals are identified, meet the organizational requirements, and are integrated in relevant processes; b) formulate, review, and approve information security policy; c) review the effectiveness of the implementation of the information security policy; d) provide clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives; e) provide the resources needed for information security; f) approve assignment of specific roles and responsibilities for information security across the organization; g) initiate plans and programs to maintain information security awareness; h) ensure that the implementation of information security controls is co-ordinated across the organization (see 6.1.2).  Management should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security advice, and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the organization.  Depending on the size of the organization, such responsibilities could be handled by a dedicated management forum or by an existing management body, such as the board of directors.   Other information Further information is contained in ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 9 Information security activities should be co-ordinated by representatives from different parts of the organization with relevant roles and job functions.  Implementation guidance Typically, information security co-ordination should involve the co-operation and collaboration of managers, users, administrators, application designers, auditors and security personnel, and specialist skills in areas such as insurance, legal issues, human resources, IT or  risk management.  This activity should:   a) ensure that security activities are executed in compliance with the information security policy;  b) identify how to handle non-compliances; c) approve methodologies and processes for information security, e.g. risk assessment, information classification; d) identify significant threat changes and exposure of information and information processing facilities to threats; e) assess the adequacy and co-ordinate the implementation of information security controls; f) effectively promote information security education, training and awareness  throughout the organization; g) evaluate information received from the monitoring and reviewing of information security incidents, and recommend appropriate actions in response to identified information security incidents.  If the organization does not use a separate cross-functional group, e.g. because such a group is not appropriate for the organization’s size, the actions described above should be undertaken by another suitable management body or individual manager.  6.1.3 Allocation of information security responsibilities Control All information security responsibilities should be clearly defined.  Implementation guidance Allocation of information security responsibilities should be done in accordance with the information security policy (see clause 4).  Responsibilities for the protection of individual assets and for carrying out specific security processes should be clearly identified.  This responsibility should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information processing facilities. Local responsibilities for the protection of assets and for carrying out specific security processes, such as business continuity planning, should be clearly defined.  Individuals with allocated security responsibilities may delegate security tasks to others. Nevertheless they remain responsible and should determine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.  Areas for which individuals are responsible should be clearly stated; in particular the following should take place:  a) the assets and security processes associated with each particular system should be identified and clearly defined; b) the entity responsible for each asset or security process should be assigned and the details of this responsibility should be documented (see also 7.1.2); 6.1.2 Information security co-ordination Control ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 10 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved c) authorization levels should be clearly defined and documented.  Other information In many organizations an information security manager will be appointed to take overall responsibility for the development and implementation of security and to support the identification of controls.  However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain with individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible for its day-to-day protection. 6.1.4 Authorization process for information processing facilities Control A management authorization process for new information processing facilities should be defined and implemented.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered for the authorization process:  a) new facilities should have appropriate user management authorization, authorizing their purpose and use. Authorization should also be obtained from the manager responsible for maintaining the local information system security environment to ensure that all relevant security policies and requirements are met; b) where necessary, hardware and software should be checked to ensure that they are compatible with other system components; c) the use of personal or privately owned information processing facilities, e.g. laptops, home-computers or hand-held devices, for processing business information, may introduce new vulnerabilities and necessary controls should be identified and implemented. 6.1.5 Confidentiality agreements Control Requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the organization’s needs for the protection of information should be identified and regularly reviewed.  Implementation guidance Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the requirement to protect confidential information using legally enforceable terms.  To identify requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered: a) a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information); b) expected duration of an agreement, including cases where confidentiality might need to be maintained indefinitely; c) required actions when an agreement is terminated; d) responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid unauthorized information disclosure (such as ‘need to know’); e) ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to the protection of confidential information; f) the permitted use of confidential information, and rights of the signatory to use information; g) the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 11 h) process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential information breaches;  i) terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement cessation; and j) expected actions to be taken in case of a breach of this agreement. Based on an organization’s security requirements, other elements may be needed in a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should comply with all applicable laws and regulations for the jurisdiction to which it applies (see also 15.1.1).  Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and when changes occur that influence these requirements.  Other Information Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protect organisational information and inform signatories of their responsibility to protect, use, and disclose information in a responsible and authorised manner. There may be a need for an organisation to use different forms of confidentiality or non-disclose agreements in different circumstances. 6.1.6 Contact with authorities Control Appropriate contacts with relevant authorities should be maintained.  Implementation guidance Organizations should have procedures in place that specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, fire department, supervisory authorities) should be contacted, and how identified information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner if it is suspected that laws may have been broken.  Organizations under attack from the Internet may need external third parties (e.g. an Internet service provider or telecommunications operator) to take action against the attack source.   Other information Maintaining such contacts may be a requirement to support information security incident management (Section 13.2) or the business continuity and contingency planning process (Section 14).  Contacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in law or regulations, which have to be followed by the organization.  Contacts with other authorities include utilities, emergency services, and health and safety, e.g. fire departments (in connection with business continuity, see also section 14), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing and availability), water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment). 6.1.7 Contact with special interest groups Control Appropriate contacts with special interest groups or other specialist security forums and professional associations should be maintained.  Implementation guidance Membership in special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to:  a) improve knowledge about best practices and staying up to date with relevant security information;  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 12 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved b) ensure the understanding of the information security environment is current and complete; c) receive early warnings of alerts, advisories, and patches pertaining to attacks and vulnerabilities; d) gain access to specialist information security advice; e) share and exchange information about new technologies, products, threats, or vulnerabilities; f) provide suitable liaison points when dealing with information security incidents (see also 13.2.1).  Other information Information sharing agreements can be established to improve cooperation and coordination of security issues. Such agreements should identify requirements for the protection of sensitive information.   6.1.8 Independent review of information security Control The organization’s approach to managing information security and its implementation (i.e. control objectives controls, policies, processes, and procedures for information security) should be reviewed independently at planned interval, or when significant changes to the security implementation occur.  Implementation guidance The independent review should be initiated by management. Such an independent review is necessary to ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the organization's approach to managing information security. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement and the need for changes to the approach to security, including the policy and control objectives.   Such a review should be carried out by individuals independent of the area under review, e.g. the internal audit function, an independent manager or a third party organization specializing in such reviews.  Individuals carrying out these reviews should have the appropriate skills and experience.   The results of the independent review should be recorded and reported to the management who initiated the review. These records should be maintained.  If the independent review identifies that the organization’s approach and implementation to managing information security is inadequate or not compliant with the direction for information security stated in the information security policy document (see 5.1.1), management should consider corrective actions.   Other information The area, which managers should regularly review (see 15.2.1), may also be reviewed independently. Review techniques may include interviews to management, checking records or review of security policy documents.  ISO 19011:2002, Guidelines for quality and/or environmental management systems auditing, may also provide helpful guidance for carrying out the independent review, including establishment and implementation of review programme.  Section 15.3 specifies controls relevant to the independent review on operational information system and the use of system audit tools.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 13 The security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities should not be reduced by the introduction of external party products or services. Any access to the organization’s information processing facilities and processing and communication of information by external parties should be controlled. Where there is a business need for working with external parties that may require access to the organization’s information and information processing facilities, or in obtaining or providing a product and service from or to an external party, a risk assessment should be carried out to determine security implications and control requirements.  Controls should be agreed and defined in an agreement with the external party. 6.2.1 Identification of risks related to external parties Control The risks to the organization’s information and information processing facilities from business processes involving external parties should be identified and appropriate controls implemented before granting access.  Implementation guidance Where there is a need to allow an external party access to the information processing facilities or information of an organization, a risk assessment (see also Section 4) should be carried out to identify any requirements for specific controls.  The identification of risks related to external party access should take into account the following issues:  a) the information processing facilities an external party is required to access; b) the type of access the external party will have to the information and information processing facilities, e.g.: 1) physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets; 2) logical access, e.g. to an organization’s databases, information systems; 3) network connectivity between the organization’s and the external party’s network(s), e.g. permanent connection, remote access; 4) whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site; c) the value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business operations; d) the controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by external parties; e) the external party personnel involved in handling the organization’s information; f) how the organization or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the authorization verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed; g) the different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, processing, communicating, sharing and exchanging information; h) the impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information; i) practices and procedures to deal with information security incidents and potential damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the case of an information security incident; 6.2 External parties Objective: To maintain the security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities that are accessed, processed, communicated to, or managed by external parties. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 14 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved k) how the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements.  Access by external parties to the organization’s information should not be provided until the appropriate controls have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining the terms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement.  Generally, all security requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be reflected by the agreement with the external party (see also 6.2.2 and 6.2.3).  It should be ensured that the external party is aware of their obligations, and accepts the responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, processing, communicating, or managing the organization’s information and information processing facilities.  Other information Information might be put at risk by external parties with inadequate security management.  Controls should be identified and applied to administer external party access to information processing facilities.  For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure agreements might be used.    Organizations may face risks associated with inter-organizational processes, management, and communication if a high degree of outsourcing is applied, or where there are several external parties involved.   The controls 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 cover different external party arrangements, e.g. including:  a) service providers, such as ISPs, network providers, telephone services, maintenance and support services; b) managed security services; c) customers;  d) outsourcing of facilities and/or operations, e.g. IT systems, data collection services, call centre operations; e) management and business consultants, and auditors;  f) developers and suppliers, e.g. of software products and IT systems; g) cleaning, catering, and other outsourced support services;  h) temporary personnel, student placement, and other casual short-term appointments. Such agreements can help to reduce the risks associated with external parties. 6.2.2 Addressing security when dealing with customers Control All identified security requirements should be addressed before giving customers access to the organization’s information or assets.  Implementation guidance The following terms should be considered to address security prior to giving customers access to any of the organization’s assets (depending on the type and extent of access given, not all of them might apply):    a) asset protection, including: 1) procedures to protect the organization’s assets, including information and software, and management of known vulnerabilities; j) legal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the external party that should be taken into account; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 15 2) procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g. loss or modification of data, has occurred; 3) integrity; 4) restrictions on copying and disclosing information; b) description of the product or service to be provided; c) the different reasons, requirements, and benefits for customer access;  d) access control policy, covering: 1) permitted access methods, and the control and use of unique identifiers such as user IDs and passwords; 2) an authorization process for user access and privileges; 3) a statement that all access that is not explicitly authorised is forbidden; 4) a process for revoking access rights or interrupting the connection between systems;  e) arrangements for reporting, notification, and investigation of information inaccuracies (e.g. of personal details), information security incidents and security breaches; f) a description of each service to be made available; g) the target level of service and unacceptable levels of service; h) the right to monitor, and revoke, any activity related to the organization’s assets;  i) the respective liabilities of the organization and the customer; j) responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with customers in other countries (see also 15.1); k) intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5).  Other information The security requirements related to customers accessing organizational assets can vary considerably depending on the information processing facilities and information being accessed.  These security requirements can be addressed using customer agreements, which contains all identified risks and security requirements (see 6.2.1).  Agreements with external parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting external party access should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their access and involvement.  6.2.3 Addressing security in third party agreements Control Agreements with third parties involving accessing, processing, communicating or managing the organization’s information or information processing facilities, or adding products or services to information processing facilities should cover all relevant security requirements.  Implementation guidance The agreement should ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the organization and the third party.  Organizations should satisfy themselves as to the indemnity of the third party.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 16 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved The following terms should be considered for inclusion in the agreement in order to satisfy the identified security requirements (see 6.2.1):  a) the information security policy; b) controls to ensure asset protection, including: 1) procedures to protect organizational assets, including information, software and hardware; 2) any required physical protection controls and mechanisms; 3) controls to ensure protection against malicious software (see 10.4.1); 4) procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g. loss or modification of information, software and hardware, has occurred; 5) controls to ensure the return or destruction of information and assets at the end of, or at an agreed point in time during, the agreement; 6) confidentiality, integrity, availability, and any other relevant property (see 2.1.5) of the assets;  7) restrictions on copying and disclosing information, and using confidentiality agreements (see 6.1.5);  c) user and administrator training in methods, procedures, and security; d) ensuring user awareness for information security responsibilities and issues; e) provision for the transfer of personnel, where appropriate; f) responsibilities regarding hardware and software installation and maintenance; g) a clear reporting structure and agreed reporting formats; h) a clear and specified process of change management; i) access control policy, covering: 1) the different reasons, requirements, and benefits that make the access by the third party necessary;  2) permitted access methods, and the control and use of unique identifiers such as user IDs and passwords; 3) an authorization process for user access and privileges; 4) a requirement to maintain a list of individuals authorized to use the services being made available, and what their rights and privileges are with respect to such use; 5) a statement that all access that is not explicitly authorised is forbidden; 6) a process for revoking access rights or interrupting the connection between systems;  j) arrangements for reporting, notification, and investigation of information security incidents and security breaches, as well as violations of the requirements stated in the agreement; k) a description of the product or service to be provided, and a description of the information to be made available along with its security classification (see 7.2.1); l) the target level of service and unacceptable levels of service; m) the definition of verifiable performance criteria, their monitoring and reporting; n) the right to monitor, and revoke, any activity related to the organization’s assets; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 17 o) the right to audit responsibilities defined in the agreement, to have those audits carried out by a third party, and to enumerate the statutory rights of auditors; p) the establishment of an escalation process for problem resolution;  q) service continuity requirements, including measures for availability and reliability, in accordance with an organization’s business priorities; r) the respective liabilities of the parties to the agreement; s) responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with organizations in other countries (see also 15.1); t) intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5); u) involvement of the third party with subcontractors, and the security controls these subcontractors need to implement; v) conditions for renegotiation/termination of agreements: 1) a contingency plan should be in place in case either party wishes to terminate the relation before the end of the  agreements; 2) renegotiation of agreements if the security requirements of the organization change; 3) current documentation of asset lists, licences, agreements or rights relating to them.  Other information The agreements can vary considerably for different organizations and among the different types of third parties.  Therefore, care should be taken to include all identified risks and security requirements (see also 6.2.1) in the agreements.  Where necessary, the required controls and procedures can be expanded in a security management plan.  If information security management is outsourced, the agreements should address how the third party will guarantee that adequate security, as defined by the risk assessment, will be maintained, and how security will be adapted to identify and deal with changes to risks.   Some of the differences between outsourcing and the other forms of third party service provision include the question of liability, planning the transition period and potential disruption of operations during this period, contingency planning arrangements and due diligence reviews, and collection and management of information on security incidents.  Therefore, it is important that the organization plans and manages the transition to an outsourced arrangement and has suitable processes in place to manage changes and the renegotiation/termination of agreements.  The procedures for continuing processing in the event that the third party becomes unable to supply its services need to be considered in the agreement to avoid any delay in arranging replacement services.  Agreements with third parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting third party access should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their access and involvement.   Generally agreements are primarily developed by the organization.  There may be occasions in some circumstances where an agreement may be developed and imposed upon an organization by a third party.  The organization needs to ensure that its own security is not unnecessarily impacted by third party requirements stipulated in imposed agreements. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 18 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 7 Asset management 7.1 Responsibility for assets Objective: To achieve and maintain appropriate protection of organizational assets. All assets should be accounted for and have a nominated owner. Owners should be identified for all assets and the responsibility for the maintenance of appropriate controls should be assigned. The implementation of specific controls may be delegated by the owner as appropriate but the owner remains responsible for the proper protection of the assets. 7.1.1 Inventory of assets Control All assets should be clearly identified and an inventory of all important assets drawn up and maintained.  Implementation guidance An organization should identify all assets and document the importance of these assets.  The asset inventory should include all information necessary in order to recover from a disaster, including type of asset, format, location, backup information, license information, and a business value. The inventory should not duplicate other inventories unnecessarily, but it should be ensured that the content is aligned.   In addition, ownership (see 7.1.2) and information classification (see 7.2) should be agreed and documented for each of the assets.  Based on the importance of the asset, its business value and its security classification, levels of protection commensurate with the importance of the assets should be identified (more information on how to value assets to represent their importance can be found in ISO/IEC TR 13335-3).   Other information There are many types of assets, including:  a) information: databases and data files, contracts and agreements, system documentation, research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, business continuity plans, fallback arrangements, audit trails, and archived information; b) software assets: application software, system software, development tools, and utilities; c) physical assets: computer equipment, communications equipment,  removable media, and other equipment; d) services: computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning; e) people, and their qualifications, skills, and experience; f) intangibles, such as reputation and image of the organization.  Inventories of assets help to ensure that effective asset protection takes place, and may also be required for other business purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial (asset management) reasons. The process of compiling an inventory of assets is an important prerequisite of risk management (see also Section 4).  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 19 7.1.2 Ownership of assets Control All information and assets associated with information processing facilities should be owned2 by a designated part of the organization.   Implementation guidance The asset owner should be responsible for:  a) ensuring that information and assets associated with information processing facilities are appropriately classified;  b) defining and periodically reviewing access restrictions and classifications, taking into account applicable access control policies.  Ownership may be allocated to:  a) a business process; b) a defined set of activities; c) an application; or d) a defined set of data.  Other information Routine tasks may be delegated, e.g. to a custodian looking after the asset on a daily basis, but the responsibility remains with the owner.  In complex information systems it may be useful to designate groups of assets, which act together to provide a particular function as ‘services’. In this case the service owner is responsible for the delivery of the service, including the functioning of the assets, which provide it.  7.1.3 Acceptable use of assets Control Rules for the acceptable use of information and assets associated with information processing facilities should be identified, documented, and implemented.  Implementation guidance All employees, contractors and third party users should follow rules for the acceptable use of information and assets associated with information processing facilities, including:  a) rules for electronic mail and Internet usages (see 10.8); b) guidelines for the use of mobile devices, especially for the use outside the premises of the organization (see 11.7.1);  Specific rules or guidance should be provided by the relevant management.  Employees, contractors and third party users using or having access to the organization’s assets should be aware of the limits existing for their use of organization’s information and assets associated with information processing facilities, and resources.  They should be responsible for their use of any information processing resources, and of any such use carried out under their responsibility.                                                            2 The term ‘owner’ identifies an individual or entity that has approved management responsibility for controlling the production, development,  maintenance, use and security of the assets. The term ’owner’ does not mean that the person actually has any property rights to the asset.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 20 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 7.2 Information classification Objective: To ensure that information receives an appropriate level of protection. Information should be classified to indicate the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection when handling the information. Information has varying degrees of sensitivity and criticality. Some items may require an additional level of protection or special handling. An information classification scheme should be used to define an appropriate set of protection levels and communicate the need for special handling measures. 7.2.1 Classification guidelines Control Information should be classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, and criticality to the organization.   Implementation guidance Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business needs for sharing or restricting information and the business impacts associated with such needs.   Classification guidelines should include conventions for initial classification and reclassification over time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy (see 11.1.1).  It should be the responsibility of the asset owner (see 7.1.2) to define the classification of an asset, periodically review it, and ensure it is kept up to date and at the appropriate level.  The classification should take account of the aggregation effect mentioned in 10.7.2.  Consideration should be given to the number of classification categories and the benefits to be gained from their use. Overly complex schemes may become cumbersome and uneconomic to use or prove impractical. Care should be taken in interpreting classification labels on documents from other organizations, which may have different definitions for the same or similarly named labels.  Other Information The level of protection can be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any other requirements for the information considered.   Information often ceases to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time, for example, when the information has been made public. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense.  Considering documents with similar security requirements together when assigning classification levels might help to simplify the classification task.  In general, the classification given to information is a shorthand way of determining how this information is to be handled and protected. 7.2.2 Information labeling and handling Control An appropriate set of procedures for information labeling and handling should be developed and implemented in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the organization.  Implementation guidance Procedures for information labeling need to cover information assets in physical and electronic formats.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 21 Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should carry an appropriate classification label (in the output). The labeling should reflect the classification according to the rules established in 7.2.1. Items for consideration include printed reports, screen displays, recorded media (e.g. tapes, disks, CDs), electronic messages, and file transfers.  For each classification level, handling procedures including the secure processing, storage, transmission, declassification, and destruction should be defined.  This should also include the procedures for chain of custody and logging of any security relevant event.  Agreements with other organizations that include information sharing should include procedures to identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification labels from other organizations.  Other Information Labeling and secure handling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing arrangements.  Physical labels are a common form of labeling. However, some information assets, such as documents in electronic form, cannot be physically labeled and electronic means of labeling need to be used. For example, notification labeling may appear on the screen or display. Where labeling is not feasible, other means of designating the classification of information may be applied, e.g. via procedures or meta-data.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 22 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 8 Human resources security 8.1 Prior to employment3 Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users understand their responsibilities, and are suitable for the roles they are considered for, and to reduce the risk of theft, fraud or misuse of facilities.  Security responsibilities should be addressed prior to employment in adequate job descriptions and in terms and conditions of employment. All candidates for employment, contractors and third party users should be adequately screened, especially for sensitive jobs. Employees, contractors and third party users of information processing facilities should sign an agreement on their security roles and responsibilities. 8.1.1 Roles and responsibilities Control Security roles and responsibilities of employees, contractors and third party users should be defined and documented in accordance with the organization’s information security policy.  Implementation guidance Security roles and responsibilities should include the requirement to:   a) implement and act in accordance with the organization’s information security policies (see 5.1); b) protect assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or interference; c) execute particular security processes or activities; d) ensure responsibility is assigned to the individual for actions taken; e) report security events or potential events or other security risks to the organization.    Security roles and responsibilities should be defined and clearly communicated to job candidates during the pre-employment process.  Other Information Job descriptions can be used to document security roles and responsibilities. Security roles and responsibilities for individuals not engaged via the organization’s employment process, e.g. engaged via a third party organization, should also be clearly defined and communicated. 8.1.2 Screening Control Background verification checks on all candidates for employment, contractors, and third party users should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and ethics, and proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks.                                                             3 Explanation: The word ’employment’ is meant here to cover all of the following different situations: employment of people (temporary or longer lasting), appointment of job roles, changing of job roles, assignment of contracts, and the termination of any of these arrangements. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 23 Implementation guidance Verification checks should take into account all relevant privacy, protection of personal data and/or employment based legislation, and should, where permitted, include the following:   a) availability of satisfactory character references, e.g. one business and one personal; b) a check (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant’s curriculum vitae; c) confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications; d) independent identity check (passport or similar document); e) more detailed checks, such as credit checks or checks of criminal records.  Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to information processing facilities, and in particular if these are handling sensitive information, e.g. financial information or highly confidential information, the organization should also consider further, more detailed checks.   Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification checks, e.g. who is eligible to screen people, and how, when and why verification checks are carried out.   A screening process should also be carried out for contractors, and third party users. Where contractors are provided through an agency the contract with the agency should clearly specify the agency’s responsibilities for screening and the notification procedures they need to follow if screening has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern.  In the same way, the agreement with the third party (see also 6.2.3) should clearly specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.  Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the organization should be collected and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant jurisdiction. Depending on applicable legislation, the candidates should be informed beforehand about the screening activities. 8.1.3 Terms and conditions of employment  Control As part of their contractual obligation, employees, contractors and third party users should agree and sign the terms and conditions of their employment contract, which should state their and the organization’s responsibilities for information security.  Implementation guidance The terms and conditions of employment should reflect the organization’s security policy in addition to clarifying and stating:  a) that all employees, contractors and third party users who are given access to sensitive information should sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement prior to being given access to information processing facilities; b) the employee’s, contractor’s and any other user’s legal responsibilities and rights, e.g. regarding copyright laws, data protection legislation (see also 15.1.1 and 15.1.2); c) responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational assets associated with information systems and services handled by the employee, contractor or third party user (see also 7.2.1 and 10.7.3); d) responsibilities of the employee, contractor or third party user for the handling of information received from other companies or external parties;  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 24 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved e) responsibilities of the organization for the handling of personal information, including personal information created as a result of, or in the course of, employment with the organization (see also 15.1.4); f) responsibilities that are extended outside the organization’s premises and outside normal working hours, e.g. in the case of home-working (see also 9.2.5 and 11.7.1); g) actions to be taken if the employee, contractor or third party user disregards the organization’s security requirements (see also 8.2.3).  The organization should ensure that employees, contractors and third party users agree to terms and conditions concerning information security appropriate to the nature and extent of access they will have to the organization’s assets associated with information systems and services.  Where appropriate, responsibilities contained within the terms and conditions of employment should continue for a defined period after the end of the employment (see also 8.3).   Other Information A code of conduct may be used to cover the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s responsibilities regarding confidentiality, data protection, ethics, appropriate use of the organization’s equipment and facilities, as well as reputable practices expected by the organization.  The contractor or third party users may be associated with an external organization that may in turn be required to enter in contractual arrangements on behalf of the contracted individual.  8.2 During employment  Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users are aware of information security threats and concerns, their responsibilities and liabilities, and are equipped to support organizational security policy in the course of their normal work, and to reduce the risk of human error. Management responsibilities should be defined to ensure that security is applied throughout an individual’s employment within the organization.   An adequate level of awareness, education, and training in security procedures and the correct use of information processing facilities should be provided to all employees, contractors and third party users to minimize possible security risks.  A formal disciplinary process for handling security breaches should be established. 8.2.1 Management responsibilities Control Management should require employees, contractors and third party users to apply security in accordance with established policies and procedures of the organization.  Implementation guidance Management responsibilities should include ensuring that employees, contractors and third party users:  a) are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted access to sensitive information or information systems; b) are provided with guidelines to state security expectations of their role within the organization;  c) are motivated to fulfil the security policies of the organization; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 25 d) achieve a level of awareness on security relevant to their roles and responsibilities within the organization (see also 8.2.2); e) conform to the terms and conditions of employment, which includes the organization’s information security policy and appropriate methods of working; f) continue to have the appropriate skills and qualifications.  Other Information If employees, contractors and third party users are not made aware of their security responsibilities, they can cause considerable damage to an organization.  Motivated personnel are likely to be more reliable and cause less information security incidents.  Poor management may cause personnel to feel undervalued resulting in a negative security impact to the organization.  For example, poor management may lead to security being neglected or potential misuse of the organization’s assets. 8.2.2 Information security awareness, education, and training Control All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors and third party users should receive appropriate awareness training and regular updates in organizational policies and procedures, as relevant for their job function.  Implementation guidance Awareness training should commence with a formal induction process designed to introduce the organization’s security policies and expectations before access to information or services is granted.  Ongoing training should include security requirements, legal responsibilities and business controls, as well as training in the correct use of information processing facilities e.g. log-on procedure, use of software packages and information on the disciplinary process (see 8.2.3).  Other Information The security awareness, education, and training activities should be suitable and relevant to the person’s role, responsibilities and skills, and should include information on known threats, who to contact for further security advice and the proper channels for reporting information security incidents (see also 13.1).  Training to enhance awareness is intended to allow individuals to recognize information security problems and incidents, and respond according to the needs of their work role. 8.2.3 Disciplinary process Control There should be a formal disciplinary process for employees who have committed a security breach.  Implementation guidance The disciplinary process should not be commenced without prior verification that a security breach has occurred (see also 13.2.3 for collection of evidence).  The formal disciplinary process should ensure correct and fair treatment for employees who are suspected of committing breaches of security.  The formal disciplinary process should provide for a graduated response that takes into consideration factors such as the nature and gravity of the breach and its impact on business, whether or not this is a first or repeat offence, whether or not the violator was properly trained, relevant legislation, business contracts and other factors as required. In serious cases of misconduct the process should allow for instant removal of duties, access rights and privileges, and for immediate escorting out of the site, if necessary. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 26 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved  Other Information The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees, contractors and third party users in violating organizational security policies and procedures, and any other security breaches.  8.3 Termination or change of employment Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users exit an organization or change employment in an orderly manner. Responsibilities should be in place to ensure an employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s exit from the organization is managed, and that the return of all equipment and the removal of all access rights are completed. Change of responsibilities and employments within an organization should be managed as the termination of the respective responsibility or employment in line with this section, and any new employments should be managed as described in section 8.1. 8.3.1 Termination responsibilities Control Responsibilities for performing employment termination or change of employment should be clearly defined and assigned.  Implementation guidance The communication of termination responsibilities should include ongoing security requirements and legal responsibilities and, where appropriate, responsibilities contained within any confidentiality agreement (see 6.1.5), and the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3) continuing for a defined period after the end of the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s employment.  Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of employment should be contained in employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s contracts.  Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the respective responsibility or employment, and the new responsibility or employment should be controlled as described in clause 8.1.  Other Information The Human Resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination process and works together with the supervising manager of the person leaving to manage the security aspects of the relevant procedures.  In the case of a contractor, this termination responsibility process may be undertaken by an agency responsible for the contractor, and in case of an other user this might be handled by their organization.  It may be necessary to inform employees, customers, contractors, or third party users of changes to personnel and operating arrangements. 8.3.2 Return of assets Control All employees, contractors and third party users should return all of the organization’s assets in their possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 27 The termination process should be formalized to include the return of all previously issued software, corporate documents, and equipment.  Other organizational assets such as mobile computing devices, credit cards, access cards, software, manuals, and information stored on electronic media also need to be returned.  In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user purchases the organization’s equipment or uses their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information is transferred to the organization and securely erased from the equipment (see also 10.7.1).  In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user has knowledge that is important to ongoing operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization.   8.3.3 Removal of access rights Control The access rights of all employees, contractors and third party users to information and information processing facilities should be removed upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement, or adjusted upon change.  Implementation guidance Upon termination, the access rights of an individual to assets associated with information systems and services should be reconsidered. This will determine whether it is necessary to remove access rights. Changes of an employment should be reflected in removal of all access rights that were not approved for the new employment. The access rights that should be removed or adapted include physical and logical access, keys, identification cards, information processing facilities (see also 11.2.4), subscriptions, and removal from any documentation that identifies them as a current member of the organization. If a departing employee, contractor or third party user has known passwords for accounts remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment, contract or agreement.  Access rights for information assets and information processing facilities should be reduced or removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors such as:   a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, contractor or third party user, or by management and the reason of termination; b) the current responsibilities of the employee, contractor or any other user; c) the value of the assets currently accessible.  Other Information In certain circumstances access rights may be allocated on the basis of being available to more people than the departing employee, contractor or third party user, e.g. group IDs. In such circumstances, departing individuals should be removed from any group access lists and arrangements should be made to advise all other employees, contractors and third party users involved to no longer share this information with the person departing.  In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled employees, contractors or third party users may deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons resigning, they may be tempted to collect information for future use.

Critical or sensitive information processing facilities should be housed in secure areas, protected by defined security perimeters, with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. They should be physically protected from unauthorized access, damage, and interference. The protection provided should be commensurate with the identified risks.  9.1.1 Physical security perimeter Control Security perimeters (barriers such as walls, card controlled entry gates or manned reception desks) should be used to protect areas that contain information and information processing facilities.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where appropriate for physical security perimeters:  a) security perimeters should be clearly defined, and the siting and strength of each of the perimeters should depend on the security requirements of the assets within the perimeter and the results of a risk assessment; b) perimeters of a building or site containing information processing facilities should be physically sound (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in could easily occur); the external walls of the site should be of solid construction and all external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc; doors and windows should be locked when unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at ground level; c) a manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building should be in place; access to sites and buildings should be restricted to authorized personnel only; d) physical barriers should, where applicable, be built to prevent unauthorized physical access and environmental contamination; e) all fire doors on a security perimeter should be alarmed, monitored, and tested in conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance to  suitable regional, national, and international standards; they should operate in accordance with local fire code in a failsafe manner;   f) suitable intruder detection systems should be installed to national, regional or international standards and regularly tested to cover all external doors and accessible windows; unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided for other areas, e.g. computer room or communications rooms; g) information processing facilities managed by the organization should be physically separated from those managed by third parties.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 29 Other information Physical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical barriers around the organization’s premises and information processing facilities. The use of multiple barriers gives additional protection, where the failure of a single barrier does not mean that security is immediately compromised.  A secure area may be a lockable office, or several rooms surrounded by a continuous internal physical security barrier.  Additional barriers and perimeters to control physical access may be needed between areas with different security requirements inside the security perimeter.  Special consideration towards physical access security should be given to buildings where multiple organizations are housed.  9.1.2 Physical entry controls Control Secure areas should be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered:  a) the date and time of entry and departure of visitors should be recorded, and all visitors should be supervised unless their access has been previously approved; they should only be granted access for specific, authorized purposes and should be issued with instructions on the security requirements of the area and on emergency procedures. b) access to areas where sensitive information is processed or stored should be controlled and restricted to authorized persons only; authentication controls, e.g. access control card plus PIN, should be used to authorize and validate all access; an audit trail of all access should be securely maintained; c) all employees, contractors and third party users and all visitors should be required to wear some form of visible identification and should immediately notify security personnel if they encounter unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification;  d) third party support service personnel should be granted restricted access to secure areas or sensitive information processing facilities only when required; this access should be authorized and monitored; e) access rights to secure areas should be regularly reviewed and updated, and revoked when necessary (see 8.3.3).  9.1.3 Securing offices, rooms, and facilities Control Physical security for offices, rooms, and facilities should be designed and applied.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 30 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered to secure offices, rooms, and facilities:  a) account should be taken of relevant health and safety regulations and standards; b) key facilities should be sited to avoid access by the public; c) where applicable, buildings should be unobtrusive and give minimum indication of their purpose, with no obvious signs, outside or inside the building identifying the presence of information processing activities; d) directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive information processing facilities should not be readily accessible by the public. 9.1.4 Protecting against external and environmental threats Control Physical protection against damage from fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster should be designed and applied.  Implementation guidance Consideration should be given to any security threats presented by neighboring premises, e.g. a fire in a neighbouring building, water leaking from the roof or in floors below ground level or an explosion in the street.  The following guidelines should be considered to avoid damage from fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster:  a) hazardous or combustible materials should be stored at a safe distance from a secure area. Bulk supplies such as stationery should not be stored within a secure area; b) fallback equipment and back-up media should be sited at a safe distance to avoid damage from a disaster affecting the main site; c) appropriate fire fighting equipment should be provided and suitably placed. 9.1.5 Working in secure areas Control Physical protection and guidelines for working in secure areas should be designed and applied.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered:  a) personnel should only be aware of the existence of, or activities within, a secure area on a need to know basis; b) unsupervised working in secure areas should be avoided both for safety reasons and to prevent opportunities for malicious activities; c) vacant secure areas should be physically locked and periodically checked; d) photographic, video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras in mobile devices, should not be allowed, unless authorized; The arrangements for working in secure areas include controls for the employees, contractors and third party users working in the secure area, as well as other third party activities taking place there. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 31 9.1.6 Public access, delivery, and loading areas Control Access points such as delivery and loading areas and other points where unauthorized persons may enter the premises should be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities to avoid unauthorized access.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered:  a) access to a delivery and loading area from outside of the building should be restricted to identified and authorized personnel; b) the delivery and loading area should be designed so that supplies can be unloaded without delivery personnel gaining access to other parts of the building; c) the external doors of a delivery and loading area should be secured when the internal doors are opened; d) incoming material should be inspected for potential threats (see 9.2.1d)) before this material is moved from the delivery and loading area to the point of use; e) incoming material should be registered in accordance with asset management procedures (see also 7.1.1) on entry to the site; f) incoming and outgoing shipments should be physically segregated, where possible.  9.2 Equipment security Objective: To prevent loss, damage, theft or compromise of assets and interruption to the organization’s activities. Equipment should be protected from physical and environmental threats. Protection of equipment (including that used off-site, and the removal of property) is necessary to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to information and to protect against loss or damage. This should also consider equipment siting and disposal. Special controls may be required to protect against physical threats, and to safeguard supporting facilities, such as the electrical supply and cabling infrastructure. 9.2.1 Equipment siting and protection Control Equipment should be sited or protected to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards, and opportunities for unauthorized access.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered to protect equipment:  a) equipment should be sited to minimize unnecessary access into work areas; b) information processing facilities handling sensitive data should be positioned and the viewing angle restricted to reduce the risk of information being viewed by unauthorized persons during their use, and storage facilities secured to avoid unauthorized access; c) items requiring special protection should be isolated to reduce the general level of protection required; d) controls should be adopted to minimize the risk of potential physical threats, e.g. theft, fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration, chemical effects, electrical supply interference, communications interference, electromagnetic radiation, and vandalism;   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 32 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved e) guidelines for eating, drinking, and smoking in proximity to information processing facilities should be established; f) environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, should be monitored for conditions, which could adversely affect the operation of information processing facilities; g) lightning protection should be applied to all buildings and lightning protection filters should be fitted to all incoming power and communications lines; h) the use of special protection methods, such as keyboard membranes, should be considered for equipment in industrial environments; i) equipment processing sensitive information should be protected to minimize the risk of information leakage due to emanation. 9.2.2 Supporting utilities Control Equipment should be protected from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities.  Implementation guidance All supporting utilities, such as electricity, water supply, sewage, heating/ventilation, and air conditioning should be adequate for the systems they are supporting. Support utilities should be regularly inspected and as appropriate tested to ensure their proper functioning and to reduce any risk from their malfunction or failure. A suitable electrical supply should be provided that conforms to the equipment manufacturer’s specifications.  An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to support orderly close down or continuous running is recommended for equipment supporting critical business operations. Power contingency plans should cover the action to be taken on failure of the UPS. A back-up generator should be considered if processing is required to continue in case of a prolonged power failure.  An adequate supply of fuel should be available to ensure that the generator can perform for a prolonged period. UPS equipment and generators should be regularly checked to ensure it has adequate capacity and tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, consideration could be given to using multiple power sources or, if the site is large a separate power substation.  Emergency power off switches should be located near emergency exits in equipment rooms to facilitate rapid power down in case of an emergency. Emergency lighting should be provided in case of main power failure.   The water supply should be stable and adequate to supply air conditioning, humidification equipment and fire suppression systems (where used). Malfunctions in the water supply system may damage equipment or prevent fire suppression from acting effectively. An alarm system to detect malfunctions in the supporting utilities should be evaluated and installed if required.   Telecommunications equipment should be connected to the utility provider by at least two diverse routes to prevent failure in one connection path removing voice services. Voice services should be adequate to meet local legal requirements for emergency communications.   Other information Options to achieve continuity of power supplies include multiple feeds to avoid a single point of failure in the power supply.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 33 9.2.3 Cabling security Control Power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services should be protected from interception or damage.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines for cabling security should be considered:  a) power and telecommunications lines into information processing facilities should be underground, where possible, or subject to adequate alternative protection; b) network cabling should be protected from unauthorized interception or damage, for example by using a conduit or by avoiding routes through public areas; c) power cables should be segregated from communications cables to prevent interference; d) clearly identifiable cable and equipment markings should be used to minimise handling errors, such as accidentally patching of wrong network cables; e) a documented patch list should be used to reduce the possibility of errors; f) for sensitive or critical systems further controls to consider include: 1) installation of armoured conduit and locked rooms or boxes at inspection and termination points; 2) use of alternative routings and/or transmission media providing appropriate security; 3) use of fibre optic cabling; 4) use of electromagnetic shielding to protect the cables; 5) initiation of technical sweeps and physical inspections for unauthorized devices being attached to the cables; 6) controlled access to patch panels and cable rooms; 9.2.4 Equipment maintenance Control Equipment should be correctly maintained to ensure its continued availability and integrity.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines for equipment maintenance should be considered:  a) equipment should be maintained in accordance with the supplier’s recommended service intervals and specifications; b) only authorized maintenance personnel should carry out repairs and service equipment; c) records should be kept of all suspected or actual faults, and all preventive and corrective maintenance; d) appropriate controls should be implemented when equipment is scheduled for maintenance, taking into account whether this maintenance is performed by personnel on site or external to the organization;  where necessary, sensitive information should be cleared from the equipment, or the maintenance personnel should be sufficiently cleared;  e) all requirements imposed by insurance policies should be complied with. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 34 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Security should be applied to off-site equipment taking into account the different risks working outside the organization’s premises.    Implementation guidance Regardless of ownership, the use of any information processing equipment outside the organization’s premises should be authorized by management.  The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of off-site equipment:  a) equipment and media taken off the premises should not be left unattended in public places; portable computers should be carried as hand luggage and disguised where possible when travelling; b) manufacturers’ instructions for protecting equipment should be observed at all times, e.g. protection against exposure to strong electromagnetic fields; c) home-working controls should be determined by a risk assessment and suitable controls applied as appropriate, e.g. lockable filing cabinets, clear desk policy, access controls for computers and secure communication with the office (see also ISO/IEC 18028 Network Security); d) adequate insurance cover should be in place to protect equipment off-site. Security risks, e.g. of damage, theft or eavesdropping, may vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate controls.  Other information Information storing and processing equipment includes all forms of personal computers, organizers, mobile phones, smart cards, paper or other form, which is held for home working or being transported away from the normal work location. More information about other aspects of protecting mobile equipment can be found in 11.7.1. 9.2.6 Secure disposal or re-use of equipment Control All items of equipment containing storage media should be checked to ensure that any sensitive data and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal.  Implementation guidance Devices containing sensitive information should be physically destroyed or the information should be destroyed, deleted or overwritten using techniques to make the original information non-retrievable rather than using the standard delete or format function.   Other information Damaged devices containing sensitive data may require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded.  Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment (see also 10.7.2).   9.2.5 Security of equipment off-premises Control ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 35 a) equipment, information or software should not be taken off-site without prior authorization;  b) employees, contractors and third party users who have authority to permit off-site removal of assets should be clearly identified;  c) time limits for equipment removal should be set and returns checked for compliance; d) where necessary and appropriate, equipment should be recorded as being removed off-site and recorded when returned.  Other information Spot checks, undertaken to detect unauthorized removal of property, may also be performed to detect unauthorized recording devices, weapons, etc., and prevent their entry into the site.  Such spot checks should be carried out in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations. Individuals should be made aware is spot checks are carried out, and the checks should only be performed with authorization appropriate for the legal and regulatory requirements.   9.2.7 Removal of property Control Equipment, information or software should not be taken off-site without prior authorization.  Implementation guidance  The following guidelines should be considered: ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 36 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 10 Communications and operations management 10.1 Operational procedures and responsibilities Objective: To ensure the correct and secure operation of information processing facilities. Responsibilities and procedures for the management and operation of all information processing facilities should be established. This includes the development of appropriate operating procedures. Segregation of duties should be implemented, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of negligent or deliberate system misuse. 10.1.1 Documented operating procedures Control Operating procedures should be documented, maintained, and made available to all users who need them.  Implementation guidance Documented procedures should be prepared for system activities associated with information processing and communication facilities, such as computer start-up and close-down procedures, back-up, equipment maintenance, media handling, computer room and mail handling management, and safety. The operating procedures should specify the instructions for the detailed execution of each job including:   a) processing and handling of information; b) backup (see 10.5); c) scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems, earliest job start and latest job completion times;  d) instructions for handling errors or other exceptional conditions, which might arise during job execution, including restrictions on the use of system utilities (see 11.5.4);  e) support contacts in the event of unexpected operational or technical difficulties;  f) special output and media handling instructions, such as the use of special stationery or the management of confidential output including procedures for secure disposal of output from failed jobs (see 10.7.2 and 10.7.3);  g) system restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure; h) the management of audit-trail and system log information (see 10.10). Operating procedures, and the documented procedures for system activities, should be treated as formal documents and changes authorized by management.  Where technically feasible, information systems should be managed consistently, using the same procedures, tools, and utilities. 10.1.2 Change management Control Changes to information processing facilities and systems should be controlled.  Implementation guidance Operational systems and application software should be subject to strict change management control.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 37 a) identification and recording of significant changes;  b) planning and testing of changes;  c) assessment of the potential impacts, including security impacts, of such changes;  d) formal approval procedure for proposed changes;  e) communication of change details to all relevant persons;  f) fallback procedures, including procedures and responsibilities for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes and unforeseen events. Formal management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all changes to equipment, software or procedures. When changes are made, an audit log containing all relevant information should be retained.  Other information Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and systems is a common cause of system or security failures. Changes to the operational environment, especially when transferring a system from development to operational stage, can impact on the reliability of applications (see also 12.5.1).  Changes to operational systems should only be made when there is a valid business reason to do so, such as an increase in the risk to the system. Updating systems with the latest versions of operating system or application is not always in the business interest as this could introduce more vulnerabilities and instability than the current version. There may also be a need for additional training, license costs, support, maintenance and administration overhead, and new hardware especially during migration.  10.1.3 Segregation of duties Control Duties and areas of responsibility should be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of the organization’s assets.  Implementation guidance Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse.  Care should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without authorization or detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization.  The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the controls.    Small organizations may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. It is important that security audit remains independent. 10.1.4 Separation of development, test, and operational facilities Control Development, test, and operational facilities should be separated to reduce the risks of unauthorised access or changes to the operational system.  Implementation guidance The level of separation between operational, test, and development environments that is necessary to prevent operational problems should be identified and appropriate controls implemented.   In particular, the following items should be considered:  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 38 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved a) rules for the transfer of software from development to operational status should be defined and documented; b) development and operational software should run on different systems or computer processors and in different domains or directories; c) compilers, editors, and other development tools or system utilities should not be accessible from operational systems when not required; d) the test system environment should emulate the operational system environment as closely as possible; e) users should use different user profiles for operational and test systems, and menus should display appropriate identification messages to reduce the risk of error; f) sensitive data should not be copied into the test system environment (see 12.4.2).   Other information Development and test activities can cause serious problems, e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment, or system failure. In this case, there is a need to maintain a known and stable environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access. Where development and test personnel have access to the operational system and its information, they may be able to introduce unauthorized and untested code or alter operational data. On some systems this capability could be misused to commit fraud, or introduce untested or malicious code, which can cause serious operational problems. Developers and testers also pose a threat to the confidentiality of operational information. Development and testing activities may cause unintended changes to software or information if they share the same computing environment. Separating development, test, and operational facilities is therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to operational software and business data (see also 12.4.2 for the protection of test data).  10.2 Third party service delivery management Objective: To implement and maintain the appropriate level of information security and service delivery in line with third party service delivery agreements. The organization should check the implementation of agreements, monitor compliance with the agreements and manage changes to ensure that the services delivered meet all requirements agreed with the third party.   10.2.1 Service delivery  Control It should be ensured that the security controls, service definitions and delivery levels included in the third party service delivery agreement are implemented, operated, and maintained by the third party.    Implementation guidance Service delivery by a third party should include the agreed security arrangements, service definitions, and aspects of service management. In case of outsourcing arrangements, the organization should plan the necessary transitions (of information, information processing facilities, and anything else that needs to be moved), and should ensure that security is maintained throughout the transition period.  The organization should ensure that the third party maintains sufficient service capability together with workable plans designed to ensure that agreed service continuity levels are maintained following major service failures or disaster (see 14.1).   The following items should be considered: ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 39 10.2.2 Monitoring and review of third party services Control The services, reports and records provided by the third party should be regularly monitored and reviewed, and audits should be carried out regularly.  Implementation guidance Monitoring and review of third party services should ensure that the information security terms and conditions of the agreements are being adhered to, and that information security incidents and problems are managed properly. This should involve a service management relationship and process between the organization and the third party to:   a) monitor service performance levels to check adherence to the agreements; b) review service reports produced by the third party and arrange regular progress meetings as required by the agreements;   c) provide information about information security incidents and review of this information by the third party and the organization as required by the agreements and any supporting guidelines and procedures;  d) review third party audit trails and records of security events, operational problems, failures, tracing of faults and disruptions related to the service delivered; e) resolve and manage any identified problems.  The responsibility for managing the relationship with a third party should be assigned to a designated individual or service management team.  In addition, the organization should ensure that the third party assigns responsibilities for checking for compliance and enforcing the requirements of the agreements. Sufficient technical skills and resources should be made available to monitor that requirements of the agreement (see 6.2.3), in particular the information security requirements, are being met.  Appropriate action should be taken when deficiencies in the service delivery are observed.  The organization should maintain sufficient overall control and visibility into all security aspects for sensitive or critical information or information processing facilities accessed, processed or managed by a third party.  The organization should ensure they retain visibility into security activities such as change management, identification of vulnerabilities, and information security incident reporting/response through a clearly defined reporting process, format and structure.    Other information In case of outsourcing, the organization needs to be aware that the ultimate responsibility for information processed by an outsourcing party remains with the organization. 10.2.3 Managing changes to third party services Control Changes to the provision of services, including maintaining and improving existing information security policies, procedures and controls, should be managed, taking account of the criticality of business systems and processes involved and re-assessment of risks.    Implementation guidance The process of managing changes to a third party service needs to take account of:  a) changes made by the organization to implement: 1) enhancements to the current services offered;   2) development of any new applications and systems; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 40 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 3) modifications or updates of the organization’s policies and procedures; 4) new controls to resolve information security incidents and to improve security; b) changes in third party services to implement: 1) changes and enhancement to networks; 2) use of new technologies; 3) adoption of new products or newer versions/releases; 4) new development tools and environments; 5) changes to physical location of service facilities; 6) change of vendors. 10.3 System planning and acceptance Objective: To minimize the risk of systems failures. Advance planning and preparation are required to ensure the availability of adequate capacity and resources to deliver the required system performance. Projections of future capacity requirements should be made, to reduce the risk of system overload. The operational requirements of new systems should be established, documented, and tested prior to their acceptance and use. 10.3.1 Capacity management Control The use of resources should be monitored, tuned, and projections made of future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance.  Implementation guidance For each new and ongoing activity, capacity requirements should be identified.  System tuning and monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency of systems.  Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system requirements and current and projected trends in the organization's information processing capabilities.   Particular attention needs to be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs; therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources.  They should identify trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or management information system tools.  Managers should use this information to identify and avoid potential bottlenecks and dependence on key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action. 10.3.2 System acceptance Control Acceptance criteria for new information systems, upgrades, and new versions should be established and suitable tests of the system(s) carried out during development and prior to acceptance.  Implementation guidance Managers should ensure that the requirements and criteria for acceptance of new systems are clearly defined, agreed, documented, and tested. New information systems, upgrades, and new versions ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 41 should only be migrated into production after obtaining formal acceptance. The following items should be considered prior to formal acceptance being provided:  a) performance and computer capacity requirements; b) error recovery and restart procedures, and contingency plans; c) preparation and testing of routine operating procedures to defined standards; d) agreed set of security controls in place; e) effective manual procedures; f) business continuity arrangements (see 14.1); g) evidence that installation of the new system will not adversely affect existing systems, particularly at peak processing times, such as month end; h) evidence that consideration has been given to the effect the new system has on the overall security of the organization; i) training in the operation or use of new systems; j) ease of use, as this affects user performance and avoids human error. For major new developments, the operations function and users should be consulted at all stages in the development process to ensure the operational efficiency of the proposed system design. Appropriate tests should be carried out to confirm that all acceptance criteria have been fully satisfied.  Other information Acceptance may include a formal certification and accreditation process to verify that the security requirements have been properly addressed.   10.4 Protection against malicious and mobile code Objective: To protect the integrity of software and information. Precautions are required to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious code and unauthorized mobile code. Software and information processing facilities are vulnerable to the introduction of malicious code, such as computer viruses, network worms, Trojan horses, and logic bombs. Users should be made aware of the dangers of malicious code. Managers should, where appropriate, introduce controls to prevent, detect, and remove malicious code and control mobile code. 10.4.1 Controls against malicious code Control Detection, prevention, and recovery controls to protect against malicious code and appropriate user awareness procedures should be implemented.  Implementation guidance Protection against malicious code should be based on malicious code detection and repair software, security awareness, and appropriate system access and change management controls. The following guidance should be considered:  a) establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software (see 15.1.2); b) establishing a formal policy to protect against risks associated with obtaining files and software either from or via external networks, or on any other medium, indicating what protective measures should be taken (see also 11.5, especially 11.5.4 and 11.5.5); ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 42 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved c) conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments should be formally investigated; d) installation and regular update of malicious code detection and repair software to scan computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the checks carried out should include: 1) checking any files on electronic or optical media, and files received over networks, for malicious code before use; 2) checking electronic mail attachments and downloads for malicious code before use; this check should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers, desk top computers and when entering the network of the organization; 3) checking web pages for malicious code; e) defining management procedures and responsibilities to deal with malicious code protection on systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malicious code attacks (see 13.1 and 13.2); f) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malicious code attacks, including all necessary data and software back-up and recovery arrangements (see clause 14); g) implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing lists and/or checking web sites giving information about new malicious code;  h) implementing procedures to verify information relating to malicious code, and ensure that warning bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified sources, e.g. reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software protecting against malicious code, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real malicious code; all users should be made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do on receipt of them. Other information The use of two or more software products protecting against malicious code across the information processing environment from different vendors can improve the effectiveness of malicious code protection.  Software to protect against malicious code can be installed to provide automatic updates of definition files and scanning engines to ensure the protection is up to date.  In addition, this software can be installed on every desktop to carry out automatic checks.  Care should be taken to protect against the introduction of malicious code during maintenance and emergency procedures, which may bypass normal malicious code protection controls. 10.4.2 Controls against mobile code Control Where the use of mobile code is authorized, the configuration should ensure that the authorised mobile code operates according to a clearly defined security policy, and unauthorized mobile code should be prevented from executing.  Implementation guidance The following actions should be considered to protect against mobile code performing unauthorized actions:  a) executing mobile code in a logically isolated environment; b) blocking any use of mobile code; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 43 c) blocking receipt of mobile code;  d) activating technical measures as available on a specific system to ensure mobile code is managed; e) control the resources available to mobile code access; f) cryptographic controls to uniquely authenticate mobile code.  Other information Mobile code is software code which transfers from one computer to another computer and then executes automatically and performs a specific function with little or no user interaction. Mobile code is associated with a number of middleware services.  In addition to ensuring that mobile code does not contain malicious code, control of mobile code is essential to avoid unauthorised use or disruption of system, network, or application resources and other breaches of information security. 10.5 Back-up Objective: To maintain the integrity and availability of information and information processing facilities. Routine procedures should be established to implement the agreed back-up policy and strategy (see also 14.1) for taking back-up copies of data and rehearsing their timely restoration. 10.5.1 Information back-up Control Back-up copies of information and software should be taken and tested regularly in accordance with the agreed backup policy.  Implementation guidance Adequate back-up facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure.  The following items for information back up should be considered:  a) the necessary level of back-up information should be defined; b) accurate and complete records of the back-up copies and documented restoration procedures should be produced;  c) the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups should reflect the business requirements of the organization, the security requirements of the information involved, and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the organization; d) the back-ups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at the main site;  e) back-up information should be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental protection (see clause 9) consistent with the standards applied at the main site; the controls applied to media at the main site should be extended to cover the back-up site; f) back-up media should be regularly tested to ensure that they can be relied upon for emergency use when necessary; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 44 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved g) restoration procedures should be regularly checked and tested to ensure that they are effective and that they can be completed within the time allotted in the operational procedures for recovery; h) in situations where confidentiality is of importance, back-ups should be protected by means of encryption. Back-up arrangements for individual systems should be regularly tested to ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity plans (see clause 14).  For critical systems, the backup arrangements should cover all systems information, applications, and data necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster.   The retention period for essential business information, and also any requirement for archive copies to be permanently retained should be determined (see 15.1.3).  Other information Back up arrangements can be automated to ease the back-up and restore process.  Such automated solutions should be sufficiently tested prior to implementation and at regular intervals.   10.6 Network security management Objective: To ensure the protection of information in networks and the protection of the supporting infrastructure. The secure management of networks, which may span organizational boundaries, requires careful consideration to dataflow, legal implications, monitoring, and protection.  Additional controls may also be required to protect sensitive information passing over public networks. 10.6.1 Network controls Control Networks should be adequately managed and controlled, in order to be protected from threats, and to maintain security for the systems and applications using the network, including information in transit.    Implementation guidance Network managers should implement controls to ensure the security of information in networks, and the protection of connected services from unauthorized access.  In particular, the following items should be considered:  a) operational responsibility for networks should be separated from computer operations where appropriate (see 10.1.3); b) responsibilities and procedures for the management of remote equipment, including equipment in user areas, should be established; c) special controls should be established to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public networks or over wireless networks, and to protect the connected systems and applications (see 11.4 and 12.3); special controls may also be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected; d) appropriate logging and monitoring should be applied to enable recording of security relevant actions; e) management activities should be closely co-ordinated both to optimize the service to the organization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing infrastructure.

Implementation guidance The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way should be determined and regularly monitored, and the right to audit should be agreed.  The security arrangements necessary for particular services, such as security features, service levels, and management requirements, should be identified. The organization should ensure that network service providers implement these measures.  Other information Network services include the provision of connections, private network services, and value added networks and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These services can range from simple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.  Security features of network services could be:   a) technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption, and network connection controls;    b) technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in accordance with the security and network connection rules;  c) procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or applications, where necessary. 10.7 Media handling Objective: To prevent unauthorized disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of assets, and interruption to business activities. Media should be controlled and physically protected. Appropriate operating procedures should be established to protect documents, computer media (e.g. tapes, disks), input/output data and system documentation from unauthorized disclosure, modification, removal, and destruction. 10.7.1 Management of removable media Control There should be procedures in place for the management of removable media.   Implementation guidance The following guidelines for the management of removable media should be considered:  a) if no longer required, the contents of any re-usable media that are to be removed from the organization should be made unrecoverable; Security techniques – IT network security. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 46 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved b) where necessary and practical, authorization should be required for media removed from the organization and a record of such removals should be kept in order to maintain an audit trail;  c) all media should be stored in a safe, secure environment, in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications; d) information stored on media that needs to be available longer than the media lifetime (in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications) should be also stored elsewhere to avoid information loss due to media degradation; e) registration of removable media should be considered to limit the opportunity for data loss;  f) removable media drives should only be enabled if there is a business reason for doing so.  All procedures and authorization levels should be clearly documented.  Other information Removable media include tapes, disks, flash disks, removable hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and printed media. 10.7.2 Disposal of media Control Media should be disposed of securely and safely when no longer required, using formal procedures.   Implementation guidance Formal procedures for the secure disposal of media should minimize the risk of sensitive information leakage to unauthorised persons. The procedures for secure disposal of media containing sensitive information should be commensurate with the sensitivity of that information. The following items should be considered:  a) media containing sensitive information should be stored and disposed of securely and safely, e.g. by incineration or shredding, or erased of data for use by another application within the organization; b) procedures should be in place to identify the items that might require secure disposal; c) it may be easier to arrange for all media items to be collected and disposed of securely, rather than attempting to separate out the sensitive items; d) many organizations offer collection and disposal services for papers, equipment and media; care should be taken in selecting a suitable contractor with adequate controls and experience; e) disposal of sensitive items should be logged where possible in order to maintain an audit trail. When accumulating media for disposal, consideration should be given to the aggregation effect, which may cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive.  Other information Sensitive information could be disclosed through careless disposal of media (see also 9.2.6 for information about disposal of equipment).  10.7.3 Information handling procedures Control Procedures for the handling and storage of information should be established to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure or misuse.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 47  Implementation guidance Procedures should be drawn up for handling; processing, storing, and communicating information consistent with its classification (see 7.2). The following items should be considered:  a) handling and labelling of all media to its indicated classification level; b) access restrictions to prevent access from unauthorized personnel; c) maintenance of a formal record of the authorized recipients of data; d) ensuring that input data is complete, that processing is properly completed and that output validation is applied; e) protection of spooled data awaiting output to a level consistent with its sensitivity; f) storage of media in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications; g) keeping the distribution of data to a minimum; h) clear marking of all copies of media for the attention of the authorized recipient; i) review of distribution lists and lists of authorized recipients at regular intervals.

Implementation guidance To secure system documentation, the following items should be considered:  a) system documentation should be stored securely; b) the access list for system documentation should be kept to a minimum and authorized by the application owner; c) system documentation held on a public network, or supplied via a public network, should be appropriately protected.  Other information System documentation may contain a range of sensitive information, e.g. descriptions of applications processes, procedures, data structures, authorization processes.  10.8 Exchange of information Objective: To maintain the security of information and software exchanged within an organization and with any external entity. Exchanges of information and software between organizations should be based on a formal exchange policy, carried out in line with exchange agreements, and should be compliant with any relevant legislation (see clause 15). Procedures and standards should be established to protect information and physical media containing information in transit.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 48 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 10.8.1 Information exchange policies and procedures Control  Formal exchange policies, procedures, and controls should be in place to protect the exchange of information through the use of all types of communication facilities.  Implementation guidance The procedures and controls to be followed when using electronic communication facilities for information exchange should consider the following items:  a) procedures designed to protect exchanged information from interception, copying, modification, mis-routing, and destruction;  b) procedures for the detection of and protection against malicious code that may be transmitted through the use of electronic communications (see Clause 10.4.1); c) procedures for protecting communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment; d) policy or guidelines outlining acceptable use of electronic communication facilities (see 7.1.3); e) procedures for the use of wireless communications, taking into account the particular risks involved; f) employee, contractor and any other user’s responsibilities not to compromise the organization, e.g. through defamation, harassment, impersonation, forwarding of chain letters, unauthorized purchasing, etc.; g) use of cryptographic techniques e.g. to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of information (see Clause 12.3); h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business correspondence, including messages, in accordance with relevant national and local legislation and regulations;  i) not leaving sensitive or critical information on printing facilities, e.g. copiers, printers, and facsimile machines, as these may be accessed by unauthorized personnel; j) controls and restrictions associated with the forwarding of communication facilities, e.g. automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses; k) reminding personnel that they should take appropriate precautions, e.g. not to reveal sensitive information to avoid being overheard or intercepted when making a phone call by: 1) people in their immediate vicinity particularly when using mobile phones; 2) wiretapping, and other forms of eavesdropping through physical access to the phone handset or the phone line, or using scanning receivers; 3) people at the recipient’s end;  l) not leaving messages containing sensitive information on answering machines since these may be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored incorrectly as a result of misdialling; m) reminding personnel about the problems of using facsimile machines, namely: 1)  unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages; 2)  deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers; 3)  sending documents and messages to the wrong number either by misdialling or using the wrong stored number; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 49 n) reminding personnel not to register demographic data, such as the e-mail address or other personal information, in any software to avoid collection for unauthorized use; o) reminding personnel that modern facsimile machines and photocopiers have page caches and store pages in case of a paper or transmission fault, which will be printed once the fault is cleared. In addition, personnel should be reminded that they should not have confidential conversations in public places or open offices and meeting places with non-sound proofed-walls.  Information exchange facilities should comply with any relevant legal requirements (see clause 15).  Other Information Information exchange may occur through the use of a number of different types of communication facilities, including electronic mail, voice, facsimile, and video.  Software exchange may occur through a number of different mediums, including downloading from the Internet and acquired from vendors selling off-the-shelf products.  The business, legal, and security implications associated with electronic data interchange, electronic commerce, and electronic communications and the requirements for controls should be considered.  Information could be compromised due to lack of awareness, policy or procedures on the use of information exchange facilities, e.g. being overheard on a mobile phone in a public place, misdirection of an electronic mail message, answering machines being overheard, unauthorised access to dial-in voice-mail systems or accidentally sending facsimiles to the wrong facsimile equipment.  Business operations could be disrupted and information could be compromised if communications facilities fail, are overloaded or interrupted (see 10.3 and clause 14).  Information could be compromised if accessed by unauthorized users (see clause 11). 10.8.2 Exchange agreements Control  Agreements should be established for the exchange of information and software between the organization and external parties.

Policies, procedures, and standards should be established and maintained to protect information and physical media in transit (see also 10.8.3), and should be referenced in such exchange agreements.  The security content of any agreement should reflect the sensitivity of the business information involved.  Other Information Agreements may be electronic or manual, and may take the form of formal contracts or conditions of employment.  For sensitive information, the specific mechanisms used for the exchange of such information should be consistent for all organizations and types of agreements. 10.8.3 Physical media in transit Control  Media containing information should be protected against unauthorized access, misuse or corruption during transportation beyond an organization’s physical boundaries.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered to protect information media being transported between sites:  a) reliable transport or couriers should be used; b) a list of authorized couriers should be agreed with management; c) procedures to check the identification of couriers should be developed; d) packaging should be sufficient to protect the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications (e.g. for software), for example protecting against any environmental factors that may reduce the media’s restoration effectiveness such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; e) controls should be adopted, where necessary, to protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure or modification; examples include: 1) use of locked containers; 2) delivery by hand; 3) tamper-evident packaging (which reveals any attempt to gain access); 4) in exceptional cases, splitting of the consignment into more than one delivery and dispatch by different routes.  Other Information Information can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse or corruption during physical transport, for instance when sending media via the postal service or via courier. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 51  Implementation guidance Security considerations for electronic messaging should include the following:  a) protecting messages from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service; b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message; c) general reliability and availability of the service;  d) legal considerations, for example requirements for electronic signatures; e) obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging or file sharing;   f) stronger levels of authentication controlling access from publicly accessible networks.  Other Information Electronic messaging such as email, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and instant messaging play an increasingly important role in business communications.   Electronic messaging has different risks than paper based communications. 10.8.5 Business information systems Control  Policies and procedures should be developed and implemented to protect information associated with the interconnection of business information systems.  Implementation guidance Consideration given to the security and business implications of interconnecting such facilities should include:  a) known vulnerabilities in the administrative and accounting systems where information is shared between different parts of the organization;  b) vulnerabilities of information in business communication systems, e.g. recording phone calls or conference calls, confidentiality of calls, storage of facsimiles, opening mail, distribution of mail; c) policy and appropriate controls to manage information sharing; d) excluding categories of sensitive business information and classified documents if the system does not provide an appropriate level of protection (see 7.2); e) restricting access to diary information relating to selected individuals, e.g. personnel working on sensitive projects; f) categories of personnel, contractors or business partners allowed to use the system and the locations from which it may be accessed (see 6.2 and 6.3);  g) restricting selected facilities to specific categories of user; h) identifying the status of users, e.g. employees of the organization or contractors in directories for the benefit of other users; i) retention and back-up of information held on the system (see 10.5.1); j) fallback requirements and arrangements (see 14).  10.8.4 Electronic messaging Control  Information involved in electronic messaging should be appropriately protected. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 52 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Office information systems are opportunities for faster dissemination and sharing of business information using a combination of: documents, computers, mobile computing, mobile communications, mail, voice mail, voice communications in general, multimedia, postal services/facilities and facsimile machines. 10.9 Electronic commerce services Objective: To ensure the security of electronic commerce services, and their secure use.  The security implications associated with using electronic commerce services, including on-line transactions, and the requirements for controls, should be considered. The integrity and availability of information electronically published through publicly available systems should also be considered. 10.9.1 Electronic commerce Control  Information involved in electronic commerce passing over public networks should be protected from fraudulent activity, contract dispute, and unauthorized disclosure and modification.  Implementation guidance Security considerations for electronic commerce should include the following:  a) the level of confidence each party requires in each others claimed identity, e.g. through authentication; b) authorization processes associated with who may set prices, issue or sign key trading documents; c) ensuring that trading partners are fully informed of their authorisations; d) determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents, and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with tendering and contract processes; e) the level of trust required in the integrity of advertised price lists; f) the confidentiality of any sensitive data or information; g) the confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery address details, and confirmation of receipts; h) the degree of verification appropriate to check payment information supplied by a customer; i) selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraud; j) the level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of order information; k) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information; l) liability associated with any fraudulent transactions; m) insurance requirements.  Many of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptographic controls (see 12.3), taking into account compliance with legal requirements (see 15.1, especially 15.1.6 for cryptography legislation).  Electronic commerce arrangements between trading partners should be supported by a documented agreement which commits both parties to the agreed terms of trading, including details of authorization (see b) above). Other agreements with information service and value added network providers may be necessary. Other Information ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 53  Public trading systems should publicize their terms of business to customers.  Consideration should be given to the resilience to attack of the host(s) used for electronic commerce, and the security implications of any network interconnection required for the implementation of electronic commerce services (see 11.4.6).  Other Information Electronic commerce is vulnerable to a number of network threats that may result in fraudulent activity, contract dispute, and disclosure or modification of information.  Electronic commerce can make use of secure authentication methods, e.g. using public key cryptography and digital signatures (see also 12.3) to reduce the risks. Also, trusted third parties can be used, where such services are needed. 10.9.2 On-Line Transactions Control  Information involved in on-line transactions should be protected to prevent incomplete transmission, mis-routing, unauthorized message alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized message duplication or replay.  Implementation guidance Security considerations for on-line transactions should include the following:  a) the use of electronic signatures by each of the parties involved in the transaction; b) all aspects of the transaction, i.e. ensuring that: 1) user credentials of all parties are valid and verified; 2) the transaction remains confidential; and 3) privacy associated with all parties involved is retained; c) communications path between all involved parties is encrypted; d) protocols used to communicate between all involved parties is secured; e) ensuring that the storage of the transaction details are located outside of any public accessible environment, e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational Intranet, and not retained and exposed on a storage medium directly accessible from the Internet; f) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital signatures and/or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end-to-end certificate/signature management process. Other Information The extent of the controls adopted will need to be commensurate with the level of the risk associated with each form of on-line transaction.  Transactions may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the transaction is generated from, processed via, completed at, and/or stored.  There exist many forms of transactions that can be performed in an on-line manner e.g. contractual, financial etc. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 54 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved The integrity of information being made available on a publicly available system should be protected to prevent unauthorized modification.  Implementation guidance Software, data, and other information requiring a high level of integrity, being made available on a publicly available system, should be protected by appropriate mechanisms, e.g. digital signatures (see 12.3).  The publicly accessible system should be tested against weaknesses and failures prior to information being made available.    There should be a formal approval process before information is made publicly available.  In addition, all input provided from the outside to the system should be verified and approved.  Electronic publishing systems, especially those that permit feedback and direct entering of information, should be carefully controlled so that:  a) information is obtained in compliance with any data protection legislation (see 15.1.4); b) information input to, and processed by, the publishing system will be processed completely and accurately in a timely manner; c) sensitive information will be protected during collection, processing, and storage; d) access to the publishing system does not allow unintended access to networks to which the system is connected.  Other Information Information on a publicly available system, e.g. information on a Web server accessible via the Internet, may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the system is located, where trade is taking place or where the owner(s) reside.  Unauthorized modification of published information may harm the reputation of the publishing organization.   10.10 Monitoring   Objective: To detect unauthorized information processing activities. Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded.  Operator logs and fault logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified. An organization should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring and logging activities.  System monitoring should be used to check the effectiveness of controls adopted and to verify conformity to an access policy model.  10.10.1 Audit logging Control Audit logs recording user activities, exceptions, and information security events should be produced and kept for an agreed period to assist in future investigations and access control monitoring.  Implementation guidance Audit logs should include, when relevant:  a) user IDs; b) dates, times, and details of key events, e.g. log-on and log-off; 10.9.3 Publicly available information Control  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 55 c) terminal identity or location if possible; d) records of successful and rejected system access attempts; e) records of successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts; f) changes to system configuration; g) use of privileges; h) use of system utilities and applications; i) files accessed and the kind of access; j) network addresses and protocols;    k) alarms raised by the access control system; l) activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems.   Other information The audit logs may contain intrusive and confidential personal data. Appropriate privacy protection measures should be taken (see also 15.1.4). Where possible, system administrators should not have permission to erase or de-activate logs of their own activities (see 10.1.3). 10.10.2 Monitoring system use Control Procedures for monitoring use of information processing facilities should be established and the results of the monitoring activities reviewed regularly.    Implementation guidance The level of monitoring required for individual facilities should be determined by a risk assessment. An organisation should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring activities. Areas that should be considered include:  a) authorized access, including detail such as: 1) the user ID; 2) the date and time of key events; 3) the types of events; 4) the files accessed; 5) the program/utilities used; b) all privileged operations, such as: 1) use of privileged accounts, e.g. supervisor, root, administrator;   2) system start-up and stop; 3) I/O device attachment/detachment; c) unauthorized access attempts, such as: 1) failed or rejected user actions; 2) failed or rejected actions involving data and other resources; 3) access policy violations and notifications for network gateways and firewalls; 4) alerts from proprietary intrusion detection systems; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 56 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 1) console alerts or messages; 2) system log exceptions; 3) network management alarms; 4) alarms raised by the access control system; e) changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.   How often the results of monitoring activities are reviewed should depend on the risks involved. Risk factors that should be considered include the:  a) criticality of the application processes; b) value, sensitivity, and criticality of the information involved; c) past experience of system infiltration and misuse, and the frequency of vulnerabilities being exploited; d) extent of system interconnection (particularly public networks); e) logging facility being de-activated.  Other information Usage monitoring procedures are necessary to ensure that users are only performing activities that have been explicitly authorized.   A log review involves understanding the threats faced by the system and the manner in which these may arise. Examples of events that might require further investigation in case of information security incidents are given in 13.1.1. 10.10.3 Protection of log information  Control Logging facilities and log information should be protected against tampering and unauthorized access.  Implementation guidance Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes and operational problems with the logging facility including:  a) alterations to the message types that are recorded; b) log files being edited or deleted; c) storage capacity of the log file media being exceeded, resulting in either the failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events. Some audit logs may be required to be archived as part of the record retention policy or because of requirements to collect and retain evidence (see also 13.2.3).  Other information System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to security monitoring. To help identify significant events for security monitoring purposes, the copying of appropriate message types automatically to a second log, and/or the use of suitable system utilities or audit tools to perform file interrogation and rationalization should be considered.    System logs need to be protected, because if the data can be modified or data in them deleted, their existence may create a false sense of security.  d) system alerts or failures such as: ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 57 10.10.4 Administrator and operator logs Control System administrator and system operator activities should be logged.  Implementation guidance Logs should include:  a) the time at which an event (success or failure) occurred; b) information about the event (e.g. files handled) or failure (e.g. error occurred and corrective action taken); c) which account and which administrator or operator was involved; d) which processes were involved. System administrator and operator logs should be reviewed on a regular basis.   Other information An intrusion detection system managed outside of the control of system and network administrators can be used to monitor system and network administration activities for compliance. 10.10.5 Fault logging Control Faults should be logged, analysed, and appropriate action taken.  Implementation guidance Faults reported by users or by system programs related to problems with information processing or communications systems should be logged. There should be clear rules for handling reported faults including:  a) review of fault logs to ensure that faults have been satisfactorily resolved; b) review of corrective measures to ensure that controls have not been compromised, and that the action taken is fully authorized. It should be ensured that error logging is enabled, if this system function is available. Other information Logging of errors and faults can impact the performance of a system.  Such logging should be enabled by competent personnel, and the level of logging required for individual systems should be determined by a risk assessment, taking performance degradation into account.  10.10.6 Clock synchronization Control The clocks of all relevant information processing systems within an organization or security domain should be synchronized with an agreed accurate time source.  Implementation guidance Where a computer or communications device has the capability to operate a real-time clock, this clock should be set to an agreed standard, e.g. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local standard time. As some clocks are known to drift with time, there should be a procedure that checks for and corrects any significant variation.  The correct interpretation of the date/time format is important to ensure that the timestamp reflects the real date/time. Local specifics (e.g. daylight savings) should be taken into account.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 58 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Other information The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be required for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases.  Inaccurate audit logs may hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence.  A clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock can be used as the master clock for logging systems. A network time protocol can be used to keep all of the servers in synchronisation with the master clock.

Access to information, information processing facilities, and business processes should be controlled on the basis of business and security requirements. Access control rules should take account of policies for information dissemination and authorization. 11.1.1 Access control policy Control An access control policy should be established, documented, and reviewed based on business and security requirements for access.  Implementation guidance Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users should be clearly stated in an access control policy. Access controls are both logical and physical (see also section 9) and these should be considered together. Users and service providers should be given a clear statement of the business requirements to be met by access controls.    The policy should take account of the following:  a) security requirements of individual business applications; b) identification of all information related to the business applications and the risks the information is facing; c) policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need to know principle and security levels and classification of information (see 7.2); d) consistency between the access control and information classification policies of different systems and networks; e) relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding protection of access to data or services (see 15.1); f) standard user access profiles for common job roles in the organization; g) management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which recognizes all types of connections available; h) segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration; i) requirements for formal authorization of access requests (see 11.2.1); j) requirements for periodic review of access controls (see 11.2.4); k) removal of access rights (see 8.3.3).  Other information Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:  a) differentiating between rules that must always be enforced and guidelines that are optional or conditional; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 60 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved b) establishing rules based on the premise “Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted” rather than the weaker rule “Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden”; c) changes in information labels (see 7.2) that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user; d) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator; e) rules, which require specific approval before enactment and those, which do not. Access control rules should be supported by formal procedures and clearly defined responsibilities (see, for example, 6.1.3, 11.3, 10.4.1, 11.6). 11.2 User access management Objective: To ensure authorized user access and to prevent unauthorized access to information systems. Formal procedures should be in place to control the allocation of access rights to information systems and services. The procedures should cover all stages in the life-cycle of user access, from the initial registration of new users to the final de-registration of users who no longer require access to information systems and services. Special attention should be given, where appropriate, to the need to control the allocation of privileged access rights, which allow users to override system controls. 11.2.1 User registration Control There should be a formal user registration and de-registration procedure in place for granting and revoking access to all information systems and services.  Implementation guidance The access control procedure for user registration and de-registration should include:  a) using unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to and held responsible for their actions; the use of group IDs should only be permitted where they are necessary for business or operational reasons, and should be approved and documented; b) checking that the user has authorization from the system owner for the use of the information system or service; separate approval for access rights from management may also be appropriate; c) checking that the level of access granted is appropriate to the business purpose (see 11.1) and is consistent with organizational security policy, e.g. it does not compromise segregation of duties (see 10.1.3); d) giving users a written statement of their access rights; e) requiring users to sign statements indicating that they understand the conditions of access; f) ensuring service providers do not provide access until authorization procedures have been completed; g) maintaining a formal record of all persons registered to use the service; h) immediately removing or blocking access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs or left the organization; i) periodically checking for, and removing or blocking, redundant user IDs and accounts (see 11.2.4); j) ensuring that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 61  Other information Consideration should be given to establish user access roles based on business requirements that summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews (see 11.2.4) are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights.   Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel or service agents (see also 6.1.5, 8.1.3 and 8.2.3). 11.2.2 Privilege management Control The allocation and use of privileges should be restricted and controlled.  Implementation guidance Multi-user systems that require protection against unauthorized access should have the allocation of privileges controlled through a formal authorization process.  The following steps should be considered:  a) the access privileges associated with each system product, e.g. operating system, database management system and each application, and the users to which they need to be allocated should be identified; b) privileges should be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event basis in line with the access control policy (11.1.1), i.e. the minimum requirement for their functional role only when needed; c) an authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained. Privileges should not be granted until the authorization process is complete; d) the development and use of system routines should be promoted to avoid the need to grant privileges to users; e) the development and use of programs, which avoid the need to run with privileges should be promoted; f) privileges should be assigned to a different user ID from those used for normal business use. Other information Inappropriate use of system administration privileges (any feature or facility of an information system that enables the user to override system or application controls) can be a major contributory factor to the failures or breaches of systems. 11.2.3 User password management Control The allocation of passwords should be controlled through a formal management process.  Implementation guidance The process should include the following requirements:  a) users should be required to sign a statement to keep personal passwords confidential and to keep group passwords solely within the members of the group; this signed statement could be included in the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3); ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 62 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved b) when users are required to maintain their own passwords they should be provided initially with a secure temporary password (see 11.3.1), which they are forced to change immediately; c) establish procedures to verify the identity of a user prior to providing a new, replacement or temporary password;  d) temporary passwords should be given to users in a secure manner; the use of third parties or unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages should be avoided; e) temporary passwords should be unique to an individual and should not be guessable; f) users should acknowledge receipt of passwords; g) passwords should never be stored on computer systems in an unprotected form;  h) default vendor passwords should be altered following installation of systems or software.   Other information Passwords are a common means of verifying a user’s identity before access is given to an information system or service according to the user’s authorization.  Other technologies for user identification and authentication, such as biometrics, e.g. finger-print verification, signature verification, and use of hardware tokens, e.g. smart cards, are available, and should be considered if appropriate. 11.2.4 Review of user access rights Control Management should review users’ access rights at regular intervals using a formal process.  Implementation guidance The review of access rights should consider the following guidelines:  a) users’ access rights should be reviewed at regular intervals, e.g. a period of 6 months, and after any changes, such as promotion, demotion, or termination of employment (see 11.2.1); b) user access rights should be reviewed and re-allocated when moving from one employment to another within the same organization; c) authorizations for special privileged access rights (see 11.2.2) should be reviewed at more frequent intervals, e.g. at a period of 3 months; d) privilege allocations should be checked at regular intervals to ensure that unauthorized privileges have not been obtained; e) changes to privileged accounts should be logged for periodic review.   Other information It is necessary to regularly review users’ access rights to maintain effective control over access to data and information services.  11.3 User responsibilities Objective: To prevent unauthorized user access, and compromise or theft of information and information processing facilities. The co-operation of authorized users is essential for effective security. Users should be made aware of their responsibilities for maintaining effective access controls, particularly regarding the use of passwords and the security of user equipment. A clear desk and clear screen policy should be implemented to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or damage to papers, media, and information processing facilities.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 63 11.3.1 Password use Control Users should be required to follow good security practices in the selection and use of passwords.  Implementation guidance All users should be advised to:  a) keep passwords confidential; b) avoid keeping a record (e.g. paper, software file or hand-held device) of passwords, unless this can be stored securely and the method of storing has been approved; c) change passwords whenever there is any indication of possible system or password compromise; d) select quality passwords with sufficient minimum length which are: 1) easy to remember; 2) not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using person related information, e.g. names, telephone numbers, and dates of birth etc.; 3) not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. do not consist of words included in dictionaries); 4) free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all-alphabetic characters. e) change passwords at regular intervals or based on the number of accesses (passwords for privileged accounts should be changed more frequently than normal passwords), and avoid re-using or cycling old passwords; f) change temporary passwords at the first log-on; g) not include passwords in any automated log-on process, e.g. stored in a macro or function key; h) not share individual user passwords; i) not use the same password for business and non-business purposes. If users need to access multiple services, systems or platforms, and are required to maintain multiple separate passwords, they should be advised that they may use a single, quality password (see d) above) for all services where the user is assured that a reasonable level of protection has been established for the storage of the password within each service, system or platform.  Other information Management of the help desk system dealing with lost or forgotten passwords needs special care as this may also be a means of attack to the password system.  11.3.2 Unattended user equipment Control Users should ensure that unattended equipment has appropriate protection.  Implementation guidance All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting unattended equipment, as well as their responsibilities for implementing such protection. Users should be advised to:  a) terminate active sessions when finished, unless they can be secured by an appropriate locking mechanism, e.g. a password protected screen saver; b) log-off mainframe computers, servers, and office PCs when the session is finished (i.e. not just switch off the PC screen or terminal); ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 64 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved c) secure PCs or terminals from unauthorized use by a key lock or an equivalent control, e.g. password access, when not in use (see also 11.3.3). Other information Equipment installed in user areas, e.g. workstations or file servers, may require specific protection from unauthorized access when left unattended for an extended period. 11.3.3 Clear desk and clear screen policy Control A clear desk policy for papers and removable storage media and a clear screen policy for information processing facilities should be adopted.  Implementation guidance The clear desk and clear screen policy should take into account the information classifications (see 7.2), legal and contractual requirements (see 15.1), and the corresponding risks and cultural aspects of the organization.  The following guidelines should be considered:   a) sensitive or critical business information, e.g. on paper or on electronic storage media,  should be locked away (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of security furniture) when not required, especially when the office is vacated; b) computers and terminals should be left logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a password, token or similar user authentication mechanism when unattended and should be protected by key locks, passwords or other controls when not in use;  c) incoming and outgoing mail points and unattended facsimile machines should be protected; d) unauthorised use of photocopiers and other reproduction technology (e.g., scanners, digital cameras) should be prevented; e) documents containing sensitive or classified information should be removed from printers immediately.  Other information A clear desk/clear screen policy reduces the risks of unauthorized access, loss of, and damage to information during and outside normal working hours.  Safes or other forms of secure storage facilities might also protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion.  Consider the use of printers with pin code function, so the originators are the only ones who can get their print outs, and only when standing next to the printer.   11.4 Network access control Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to networked services. Access to both internal and external networked services should be controlled. User access to networks and network services should not compromise the security of the network services by ensuring:  a)  appropriate interfaces are in place between the organization’s network and networks owned by other organizations, and public networks;  b)  appropriate authentication mechanisms are applied for users and equipment;  c)  control of user access to information services in enforced. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 65 11.4.1 Policy on use of network services Control Users should only be provided with access to the services that they have been specifically authorized to use.  Implementation guidance A policy should be formulated concerning the use of networks and network services. This policy should cover:  a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed; b) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked services; c) management controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and network services; d) the means used to access networks and network services (e.g. the conditions for allowing dial-up access to an Internet service provider or remote system). The policy on the use of network services should be consistent with the business access control policy (see 11.1).  Other information Unauthorized and insecure connections to network services can affect the whole organization. This control is particularly important for network connections to sensitive or critical business applications or to users in high-risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s security management and control. 11.4.2 User authentication for external connections Control Appropriate authentication methods should be used to control access by remote users.   Implementation guidance Authentication of remote users can be achieved using, for example, a cryptographic based technique, hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Possible implementations of such techniques can be found in various virtual private network (VPN) solutions. Dedicated private lines can also be used to provide assurance of the source of connections.  Dial-back procedures and controls, e.g. using dial-back modems, can provide protection against unauthorized and unwanted connections to an organization’s information processing facilities. This type of control authenticates users trying to establish a connection to an organization’s network from remote locations. When using this control, an organization should not use network services, which include call forwarding, or, if they do, they should disable the use of such features to avoid weaknesses associated with call forwarding. The call back process should ensure that an actual disconnection on the organization’s side occurs. Otherwise, the remote user could hold the line open pretending that the call back verification has occurred. Call back procedures and controls should be thoroughly tested for this possibility.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 66 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Node authentication can serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques, e.g. based on machine certificates, can be used for node authentication. This is part of several VPN based solutions.  Additional authentication controls should be implemented to control access to wireless networks. In particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the greater opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.  Other information External connections provide a potential for unauthorized access to business information, e.g. access by dial-up methods. There are different types of authentication method, some of these provide a greater level of protection than others, e.g. methods based on the use of cryptographic techniques can provide strong authentication. It is important to determine from a risk assessment the level of protection required. This is needed for the appropriate selection of an authentication method.  A facility for automatic connection to a remote computer could provide a way of gaining unauthorized access to a business application. This is especially important if the connection uses a network that is outside the control of the organization’s security management. 11.4.3 Equipment identification in networks Control Automatic equipment identification should be considered as a means to authenticate connections from specific locations and equipment.  Implementation guidance Equipment identification can be used if it is important that the communication can only be initiated from a specific location or equipment. An identifier in or attached to, the equipment can be used to indicate whether this equipment is permitted to connect to the network. These identifiers should clearly indicate to which network the equipment is permitted to connect, if more than one network exists and particularly if these networks are of differing sensitivity.  It may be necessary to consider physical protection of the equipment to maintain the security of the equipment identifier.   Other information This control can be complemented with other techniques to authenticate the equipment’s user (see 11.4.2).  Equipment identification can be applied additionally to user authentication. 11.4.4 Remote diagnostic and configuration port protection Control Physical and logical access to diagnostic and configuration ports should be controlled.  Implementation guidance Potential controls for the access to diagnostic and configuration ports include the use of a key lock and supporting procedures to control physical access to the port.  An example for such a supporting procedure is to ensure that diagnostic and configuration ports are only accessible by arrangement between the manager of the computer service and the hardware/software support personnel requiring access.  Ports, services, and similar facilities installed on a computer or network facility, which are not specifically required for business functionality, should be disabled or removed.   Other information Many computer systems, network systems, and communication systems are installed with a remote diagnostic or configuration facility for use by maintenance engineers. If unprotected, these diagnostic ports provide a means of unauthorized access. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 67 11.4.5 Segregation in networks Control Groups of information services, users, and information systems should be segregated on networks.  Implementation guidance One method of controlling the security of large networks is to divide them into separate logical network domains, e.g. an organization’s internal network domains and external network domains, each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls can be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g. publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets.  The domains should be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.  Such a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the two networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7) and to block unauthorized access in accordance with the organization’s access control policy (see 11.1). An example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall.  Another method of segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user groups within the organization.   Networks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. Separate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.  The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control policy and access requirements (see 10.1), and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7).   In addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.   Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private networks.  As the perimeters of wireless networks are not well defined, a risk assessment should be carried out in such cases to identify controls (e.g. strong authentication, cryptographic methods, and frequency selection) to maintain network segregation.  Other information Networks are increasingly being extended beyond traditional organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that may require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions might increase the risk of unauthorized access to existing information systems that use the network, some of which may require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.  11.4.6 Network connection control Control For shared networks, especially those extending across the organization’s boundaries, the capability of users to connect to the network should be restricted, in line with the access control policy and requirements of the business applications (see 11.1).  Implementation guidance The network access rights of users should be maintained and updated as required by the access control policy (see 11.1.1).  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 68 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved The connection capability of users can be restricted through network gateways that filter traffic by means of pre-defined tables or rules. Examples of applications to which restrictions should be applied are:  a) messaging, e.g. electronic mail; b) file transfer; c) interactive access; d) application access. Linking network access rights to certain times of day or dates should be considered.  Other information The incorporation of controls to restrict the connection capability of the users may be required by the access control policy for shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries. 11.4.7 Network routing control Control Routing controls should be implemented for networks to ensure that computer connections and information flows do not breach the access control policy of the business applications.   Implementation guidance Routing controls should be based on positive source and destination address checking mechanisms.   Security gateways can be used to validate source and destination addresses at internal and external network control points if proxy and/or network address translation technologies are employed.  Implementers should be aware of the strength and shortcomings of any mechanisms deployed. The requirements for network routing control should be based on the access control policy (see 11.1).  Other information Shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries, may require additional routing controls.  This particularly applies where networks are shared with third party (non-organization) users.  11.5 Operating system access control Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to operating systems.  Security facilities should be used to restrict access to operating systems to authorized users. The facilities should be capable of the following:  a)  authenticating authorized users, in accordance with a defined access control policy;  b)  recording successful and failed system authentication attempts;  c) recording the use of special system privileges;  d) issuing alarms when system security policies are breached;  e)  providing appropriate means for authentication;  f)  where appropriate, restricting the connection time of users. 11.5.1 Secure log-on procedures Control Access to operating systems should be controlled by a secure log-on procedure.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 69 Implementation guidance The procedure for logging into an operating system should be designed to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum of information about the system, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance. A good log-on procedure should:  a) not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been successfully completed; b) display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized users; c) not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user; d) validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect; e) limit the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts allowed, e.g. to three attempts,  and consider: 1) recording unsuccessful and successful attempts; 2) forcing a time delay before further log-on attempts are allowed or rejecting any further attempts without specific authorization; 3) disconnecting data link connections; 4) sending an alarm message to the system console if the maximum number of log-on attempts is reached; 5) setting the number of password retries in conjunction with the minimum length of the password and the value of the system being protected;  f) limit the maximum and minimum time allowed for the log-on procedure. If exceeded, the system should terminate the log-on; g) display the following information on completion of a successful log-on: 1) date and time of the previous successful log-on; 2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on; h) not display the password being entered or consider hiding the password characters by symbols; i) not transmit passwords in clear text over a network.   Other information  If passwords are transmitted in clear text during the log-on session over a network, they may be captured by a network ‘sniffer’ program on the network.   11.5.2 User identification and authentication Control All users should have a unique identifier (user ID) for their personal use only, and a suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user.  Implementation guidance This control should be applied for all types of users (including technical support personnel, operators, network administrators, system programmers, and database administrators).  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 70 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved User IDs should be used to trace activities to the responsible individual. Regular user activities should not be performed from privileged accounts.  In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit, the use of a shared user ID for a group of users or a specific job can be used. Approval by management should be documented for such cases. Additional controls may be required to maintain accountability.  Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed either where the functions accessible or actions carried out by the ID do not need to be traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are other controls in place (e.g. password for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging such instance).  Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to passwords, such as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used.    Other information Passwords (see also 11.3.1 and 11.5.3) are a very common way to provide identification and authentication based on a secret that only the user knows. The same can also be achieved with cryptographic means and authentication protocols. The strength of user identification and authentication should be suitable to the sensitivity of the information to be accessed.  Objects such as memory tokens or smart cards that users possess can also be used for identification and authentication.  Biometric authentication technologies that use the unique characteristics or attributes of an individual can also be used to authenticate the person’s identity. A combination of technologies and mechanisms securely linked will result in stronger authentication. 11.5.3 Password management system Control Systems for managing passwords should be interactive and should ensure quality passwords.  Implementation guidance A password management system should:  a) enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability; b) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to allow for input errors; c) enforce a choice of quality passwords (see 11.3.1); d) enforce password changes (see 11.3.1); e) force users to change temporary passwords at the first log-on (see 11.2.3); f) maintain a record of previous user passwords and prevent re-use; g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered; h) store password files separately from application system data; i) store and transmit passwords in protected (e.g. encrypted or hashed) form.  Other information Passwords are one of the principal means of validating a user’s authority to access a computer service.  Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an independent authority; in such cases, points b), d) and e) of the above guidance do not apply. In most cases the passwords are selected and maintained by users.  See section 11.3.1 for guidance on the use of passwords.

Implementation guidance The following guidelines for the use of system utilities should be considered:  a) use of identification, authentication, and authorization procedures for system utilities; b) segregation of system utilities from applications software; c) limitation of the use of system utilities to the minimum practical number of trusted, authorized users (see also 11.2.2); d) authorization for ad hoc use of systems utilities; e) limitation of the availability of system utilities, e.g. for the duration of an authorized change; f) logging of all use of system utilities; g) defining and documenting of authorization levels for system utilities; h) removal or disabling of all unnecessary software based utilities and system software; i) not making system utilities available to users who have access to applications on systems where segregation of duties is required.  Other information Most computer installations have one or more system utility programs that might be capable of overriding system and application controls. 11.5.5 Session time-out Control Inactive sessions should shut down after a defined period of inactivity.  Implementation guidance A time-out facility should clear the session screen and also, possibly later, close both application and network sessions after a defined period of inactivity. The time-out delay should reflect the security risks of the area, the classification of the information being handled and the applications being used, and the risks related to the users of the equipment.  A limited form of time-out facility can be provided for some systems, which clears the screen and prevents unauthorized access but does not close down the application or network sessions.  Other information This control is particularly important in high risk locations, which include public or external areas outside the organization's security management.  The sessions should be shut down to prevent access by unauthorized persons and denial of service attacks. 11.5.6 Limitation of connection time Control Restrictions on connection times should be used to provide additional security for high-risk applications. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 72 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Connection time controls should be considered for sensitive computer applications, especially from high risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s security management. Examples of such restrictions include:  a) using predetermined time slots, e.g. for batch file transmissions, or regular interactive sessions of short duration; b) restricting connection times to normal office hours if there is no requirement for overtime or extended-hours operation; c) considering re-authentication at timed intervals. Other information Limiting the period during which connections to computer services are allowed reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.  Limiting the duration of active sessions prevents users from holding sessions open to prevent re-authenticating. 11.6 Application and information access control Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to information held in application systems. Security facilities should be used to restrict access to and within application systems. Logical access to application software and information should be restricted to authorized users. Application systems should: a)  control user access to information and application system functions, in accordance with a defined access control policy; b)  provide protection from unauthorized access by any utility, operating system software, and malicious software that is capable of overriding or bypassing system or application controls; c)  not compromise other systems with which information resources are shared. 11.6.1 Information access restriction Control Access to information and application system functions by users and support personnel should be restricted in accordance with the defined access control policy.  Implementation guidance Restrictions to access should be based on individual business application requirements. The access control policy should also be consistent with the organizational access policy (see section 11.1).  Applying the following guidelines should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements:  a) providing menus to control access to application system functions; b) controlling the access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete, and execute; c) controlling access rights of other applications; d) ensuring that outputs from application systems handling sensitive information contain only the information relevant to the use of the output and are sent only to authorized terminals and locations; this should include periodic reviews of such outputs to ensure that redundant information is removed.  Implementation guidance ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 73 Sensitive systems should have a dedicated (isolated) computing environment.  Implementation guidance The following points should be considered for sensitive system isolation:  a) the sensitivity of an application system should be explicitly identified and documented by the application owner (see 7.1.2); b) when a sensitive application is to run in a shared environment, the application systems with which it will share resources and the corresponding risks should be identified and accepted by the owner of the sensitive application.  Other information Some application systems are sufficiently sensitive to potential loss that they require special handling. The sensitivity may indicate that the application system:   a) should run on a dedicated computer; or b) should only share resources with trusted applications systems. Isolation could be achieved using physical or logical methods (see also 11.4.5). 11.7 Mobile computing and teleworking Objective: To ensure information security when using mobile computing and teleworking facilities. The protection required should be commensurate with the risks these specific ways of working cause. When using mobile computing the risks of working in an unprotected environment should be considered and appropriate protection applied. In the case of teleworking the organization should apply protection to the teleworking site and ensure that suitable arrangements are in place for this way of working. 11.7.1 Mobile computing and communications Control A formal policy should be in place, and appropriate security measures should be adopted to protect against the risks of using mobile computing and communication facilities.  Implementation guidance When using mobile computing and communicating facilities, e.g. notebooks, palmtops, laptops, smart cards, and mobile phones, special care should be taken to ensure that business information is not compromised. The mobile computing policy should take into account the risks of working with mobile computing equipment in unprotected environments.  The mobile computing policy should include the requirements for physical protection, access controls, cryptographic techniques, back-ups, and virus protection. This policy should also include rules and advice on connecting mobile facilities to networks and guidance on the use of these facilities in public places.  Care should be taken when using mobile computing facilities in public places, meeting rooms and other unprotected areas outside of the organization’s premises. Protection should be in place to avoid the unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information stored and processed by these facilities, e.g. using cryptographic techniques (see 12.3).  Users of mobile computing facilities in public places should take care to avoid the risk of overlooking by unauthorized persons. Procedures against malicious software should be in place and be kept up to date (see 10.4).  11.6.2 Sensitive system isolation Control ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 74 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved  Back-ups of critical business information should be taken regularly. Equipment should be available to enable the quick and easy back-up of information. These back-ups should be given adequate protection against, e.g., theft or loss of information.  Suitable protection should be given to the use of mobile facilities connected to networks. Remote access to business information across public network using mobile computing facilities should only take place after successful identification and authentication, and with suitable access control mechanisms in place (see 11.4).  Mobile computing facilities should also be physically protected against theft especially when left, for example, in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres, and meeting places. A specific procedure taking into account legal, insurance and other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of the mobile computing facilities. Equipment carrying important, sensitive, and/or critical business information should not be left unattended and, where possible, should be physically locked away, or special locks should be used to secure the equipment (see 9.2.5).  Training should be arranged for personnel using mobile computing to raise their awareness on the additional risks resulting from this way of working and the controls that should be implemented.  Other information Mobile network wireless connections are similar to other types of network connection, but have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. Typical differences are 1) some wireless security protocols are immature and have known weaknesses and 2) information stored on mobile computers may not be backed-up because of limited network bandwidth and/or because mobile equipment may not be connected at the times when back-ups are scheduled. 11.7.2 Teleworking Control A policy, operational plans and procedures should be developed and implemented for teleworking activities.   Implementation guidance Organizations should only authorize teleworking activities if they are satisfied that appropriate security arrangements and controls are in place, and that these comply with the organization’s security policy.  Suitable protection of the teleworking site should be in place against, e.g., the theft of equipment and information, the unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized remote access to the organization’s internal systems or misuse of facilities. Teleworking activities should both be authorized and controlled by management, and it should be ensured that suitable arrangements are in place for this way of working.  The following matters should be considered:  a) the existing physical security of the teleworking site, taking into account the physical security of the building and the local environment; b) the proposed physical teleworking environment; c) the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access to the organization’s internal systems, the sensitivity of the information that will be accessed and pass over the communication link and the sensitivity of the internal system; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 75 d) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons using the accommodation, e.g. family and friends; e) the use of home networks and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless network services;  f) policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately owned equipment; g) access to privately owned equipment (to check the security of the machine or during an investigation), which may be prevented by legislation; h) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations may become liable for licensing for client software on workstations owned privately by employees, contractors or third party users; i) anti-virus protection and firewall requirements.  The guidelines and arrangements to be considered should include:  a) the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the teleworking activities, where the use of privately owned equipment that is not under the control of the organization is not allowed; b) a definition of the work permitted, the hours of work, the classification of information that may be held and the internal systems and services that the teleworker is authorized to access; c) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing remote access; d) physical security; e) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information; f) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance; g) the provision of insurance;  h) the procedures for back-up and business continuity; i) audit and security monitoring; j) revocation of authority and access rights, and the return of equipment when the teleworking activities are terminated.  Other information Teleworking uses communications technology to enable personnel to work remotely from a fixed location outside of their organization.

Information systems include operating systems, infrastructure, business applications, off-the-shelf products, services, and user-developed applications. The design and implementation of the information system supporting the business process can be crucial for security. Security requirements should be identified and agreed prior to the development and/or implementation of information systems. All security requirements should be identified at the requirements phase of a project and justified, agreed, and documented as part of the overall business case for an information system. 12.1.1 Security requirements analysis and specification Control Statements of business requirements for new information systems, or enhancements to existing information systems should specify the requirements for security controls.   Implementation guidance Specifications for the requirements for controls should consider the automated controls to be incorporated in the information system, and the need for supporting manual controls. Similar considerations should be applied when evaluating software packages, developed or purchased, for business applications.  Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information assets involved (see also 7.2), and the potential business damage, which might result from a failure or absence of security.  System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design stage are significantly cheaper to implement and maintain than those included during or after implementation.  If products are purchased, a formal testing and acquisition process should be followed.  Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements. Where the security functionality in a proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement then the risk introduced and associated controls should be reconsidered prior to purchasing the product.  Where additional functionality is supplied and causes a security risk, this should be disabled or the proposed control structure should be reviewed to determine if advantage can be taken of the enhanced functionality available.  Other information If considered appropriate, for example for cost reasons, management may wish to make use of independently evaluated and certified products. Further information about evaluation criteria for IT security products can be found in ISO/IEC 15408 or other evaluation or certification standards, as appropriate.  ISO/IEC TR 13335-3 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify requirements for security controls.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 77 12.2 Correct processing in applications Objective: To prevent errors, loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information in applications. Appropriate controls should be designed into applications, including user developed applications to ensure correct processing. These controls should include the validation of input data, internal processing and output data. Additional controls may be required for systems that process, or have an impact on, sensitive, valuable or critical information. Such controls should be determined on the basis of security requirements and risk assessment. 12.2.1 Input data validation Control Data input to applications should be validated to ensure that this data is correct and appropriate.  Implementation guidance Checks should be applied to the input of business transactions, standing data (e.g. names and addresses, credit limits, customer reference numbers), and parameter tables (e.g. sales prices, currency conversion rates, tax rates). The following guidelines should be considered:  a) dual input or other input checks, such as boundary checking or limiting fields to specific ranges of input data, to detect the following errors: 1) out-of-range values; 2) invalid characters in data fields; 3) missing or incomplete data; 4) exceeding upper and lower data volume limits; 5) unauthorized or inconsistent control data; b) periodic review of the content of key fields or data files to confirm their validity and integrity; c) inspecting hard-copy input documents for any unauthorized changes (all changes to input documents should be authorized); d) procedures for responding to validation errors; e) procedures for testing the plausibility of the input data; f) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data input process; g) creating a log of the activities involved in the data input process (see 10.10.1).  Other information Automatic examination and validation of input data can be considered, where applicable, to reduce the risk of errors and to prevent standard attacks including buffer overflow and code injection. 12.2.2 Control of internal processing Control Validation checks should be incorporated into applications to detect any corruption of information through processing errors or deliberate acts. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 78 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved a) the use of add, modify, and delete functions to implement changes to data; b) the procedures to prevent programs running in the wrong order or running after failure of prior processing (see also 10.1.1); c) the use of appropriate programs to recover from failures to ensure the correct processing of data; d) protection against attacks using buffer overruns/overflows.  An appropriate checklist should be prepared, activities documented, and the results should be kept secure.  Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following:  a) session or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates; b) balancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely: 1) run-to-run controls; 2) file update totals; 3) program-to-program controls; c) validation of system-generated input data (see 12.2.1); d) checks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers; e) hash totals of records and files; f) checks to ensure that application programs are run at the correct time; g) checks to ensure that programs are run in the correct order and terminate in case of a failure, and that further processing is halted until the problem is resolved; h)  creating a log of the activities involved in the processing (see 10.10.1). Other information Data that has been correctly entered can be corrupted by hardware errors, processing errors or through deliberate acts.  The validation checks required will depend on the nature of the application and the business impact of any corruption of data. 12.2.3 Message integrity Control Requirements for ensuring authenticity and protecting message integrity in applications should be identified, and appropriate controls identified and implemented.  Implementation guidance An assessment of security risks should be carried out to determine if message integrity is required and to identify the most appropriate method of implementation.  Other information Cryptographic techniques (see 12.3) can be used as an appropriate means of implementing message authentication. 12.2.4 Output data validation Control Data output from an application should be validated to ensure that the processing of stored information is correct and appropriate to the circumstances.   Implementation guidance The design and implementation of applications should ensure that the risks of processing failures leading to a loss of integrity are minimized. Specific areas to consider include:  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 79 Implementation guidance Output validation may include:  a) plausibility checks to test whether the output data is reasonable; b) reconciliation control counts to ensure processing of all data; c) providing sufficient information for a reader or subsequent processing system to determine the accuracy, completeness, precision, and classification of the information; d) procedures for responding to output validation tests; e) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data output process; f) creating a log of activities in the data output validation process.  Other information Typically, systems and applications are constructed on the assumption that having undertaken appropriate validation, verification, and testing, the output will always be correct. However, this assumption is not always valid; i.e. systems that have been tested may still produce incorrect output under some circumstances. 12.3 Cryptographic controls  Objective: To protect the confidentiality, authenticity or integrity of information by cryptographic means.  A policy should be developed on the use of cryptographic controls. Key management should be in place to support the use of cryptographic techniques.  12.3.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls Control A policy on the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information should be developed and implemented.  Implementation guidance When developing a cryptographic policy the following should be considered:  a) the management approach towards the use of cryptographic controls across the organization, including the general principles under which business information should be protected (see also 5.1.1); b) based on a risk assessment, the required level of protection should be identified taking into account the type, strength, and quality of the encryption algorithm required; c) the use of encryption for protection of sensitive information transported by mobile or removable media, devices or across communication lines; d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys; e) roles and responsibilities, e.g. who is responsible for: 1) the implementation of the policy; 2) the key management, including key generation (see also 12.3.2); ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 80 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved f) the standards to be adopted for the effective implementation throughout the organization (which solution is used for which business processes); g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely upon content inspection (e.g. virus detection).   When implementing the organization’s cryptographic policy, consideration should be given to the regulations and national restrictions that might apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see also 15.1.6).  Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different security objectives, e.g.:  a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted; b) integrity/authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to protect the authenticity and integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information; c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to obtain proof of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event or action.  Other information Making a decision as to whether a cryptographic solution is appropriate should be seen as part of the wider process of risk assessment and selection of controls.  This assessment can then be used to determine whether a cryptographic control is appropriate, what type of control should be applied and for what purpose and business processes.  A policy on the use of cryptographic controls is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques, and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use.  When using digital signatures, consideration should be given to any relevant legislation, in particular legislation describing the conditions under which a digital signature is legally binding (see 15.1).   Specialist advice should be sought to identify the appropriate level of protection and to define suitable specifications that will provide the required protection and support the implementation of a secure key management system (see also 12.3.2).  ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 has developed several standards related to cryptographic controls.  Further information can also be found in IEEE P1363 and the OECD Guidelines on Cryptography. 12.3.2 Key management Control Key management should be in place to support the organization’s use of cryptographic techniques.  Implementation guidance All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification, loss, and destruction.  In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected.  A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure methods for:  a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications; b) generating and obtaining public key certificates; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 81 c) distributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when received; d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys; e) changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this will be done; f) dealing with compromised keys; g) revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived); h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management, e.g. for recovery of encrypted information; i) archiving keys, e.g. for information archived or backed up; j) destroying keys; k) logging and auditing of key management related activities. In order to reduce the likelihood of compromise, activation, and deactivation dates for keys should be defined so that the keys can only be used for a limited period of time. This period of time should be dependent on the circumstances under which the cryptographic control is being used, and the perceived risk.  In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates which are normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized organization with suitable controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.    The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services (see 6.2.3).  Other information The management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptographic techniques. ISO/IEC 11770 provides further information on key management. The two types of cryptographic techniques are:  a) secret key techniques, where two or more parties share the same key and this key is used both to encrypt and decrypt information; this key has to be kept secret since anyone having access to the key is able to decrypt all information being encrypted with that key, or to introduce unauthorized information using the key; b) public key techniques, where each user has a key pair, a public key (which can be revealed to anyone) and a private key (which has to be kept secret); public key techniques can be used for encryption and to produce digital signatures (see also ISO/IEC 9796 and ISO/IEC 14888).  There is a threat of forging a digital signature by replacing a user’s public key with. This problem is addressed by the use of a public key certificate.  Cryptographic techniques can also be used to protect cryptographic keys.  Procedures may need to be considered for handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys, e.g. encrypted information may need to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 82 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 12.4 Security of system files Objective: To ensure the security of system files. Access to system files and program source code should be controlled, and IT projects and support activities conducted in a secure manner. Care should be taken to avoid exposure of sensitive data in test environments. 12.4.1 Control of operational software Control There should be procedures in place to control the installation of software on operational systems.  Implementation guidance To minimize the risk of corruption to operational systems, the following guidelines should be considered to control changes:  a) the updating of the operational software, applications, and program libraries should only be performed by trained administrators upon appropriate management authorization (see 12.4.3); b) operational systems should only hold approved executable code, and not development code or compilers; c) applications and operating system software should only be implemented after extensive and successful testing; the tests should include tests on usability, security, effects on other systems and user-friendliness, and should be carried out on separate systems (see also 10.1.4); it should be ensured that all corresponding program source libraries have been updated;   d) a configuration control system should be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system documentation; e) a rollback strategy should be in place before changes are implemented;  f) an audit log should be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries; g) previous versions of application software should be retained as a contingency measure; h) old versions of software should be archived, together with all required information and parameters, procedures, configuration details, and supporting software for as long as the data is retained in archive. Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software.  Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the change, and the security of the release, i.e. the introduction of new security functionality or the number and severity of security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce security weaknesses (see also 12.6.1).   Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary, and with management approval. The supplier’s activities should be monitored.  Computer software may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 83 Operating systems should only be upgraded when there is a requirement to do so, for example, if the current version of the operating system no longer supports the business requirements. Upgrades should not take place just because a new version of the operating system is available. New versions of operating systems may be less secure, less stable, and less well understood than current systems. 12.4.2 Protection of system test data Control Test data should be selected carefully, and protected and controlled.  Implementation guidance The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information for testing purposes should be avoided. If personal or otherwise sensitive information is used for testing purposes, all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition before use. The following guidelines should be applied to protect operational data, when used for testing purposes:  a) the access control procedures, which apply to operational application systems, should also apply to test application systems; b) there should be separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test application system; c) operational information should be erased from a test application system immediately after the testing is complete; d) the copying and use of operational information should be logged to provide an audit trail.  Other information System and acceptance testing usually requires substantial volumes of test data that are as close as possible to operational data.  12.4.3 Access control to program source code Control Access to program source code should be restricted.  Implementation guidance Access to program source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans and validation plans) should be strictly controlled, in order to prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality and to avoid unintentional changes.  For program source code, this can be achieved by controlled central storage of such code, preferably in program source libraries.  The following guidelines should then be considered (see also 11) to control access to such program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:  a) where possible, program source libraries should not be held in operational systems; b) the program source code and the program source libraries should be managed according to established procedures; c) support personnel should not have unrestricted access to program source libraries; d) the updating of program source libraries and associated items, and the issuing of program sources to programmers should only be performed after appropriate authorization has been received; e) program listings should be held in a secure environment (see 10.7.4);  Other information ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 84 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved g) maintenance and copying of program source libraries should be subject to strict change control procedures (see 12.5.1).  Other information Program source code is code written by programmers, which is compiled (and linked) to create executables.  Certain programming languages do not formally distinguish between source code and executables as the executables are created at the time they are activated.  The standards ISO 10007 and ISO/IEC 12207 provide further information about configuration management and the software lifecycle process. 12.5 Security in development and support processes Objective: To maintain the security of application system software and information. Project and support environments should be strictly controlled. Managers responsible for application systems should also be responsible for the security of the project or support environment. They should ensure that all proposed system changes are reviewed to check that they do not compromise the security of either the system or the operating environment. 12.5.1 Change control procedures Control The implementation of changes should be controlled by the use of formal change control procedures.  Implementation guidance Formal change control procedures should be documented and enforced in order to minimize the corruption of information systems.  Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing systems should follow a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and managed implementation.  This process should include a risk assessment, analysis of the impacts of changes, and specification of security controls needed.  This process should also ensure that existing security and control procedures are not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts of the system necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is obtained.  Wherever practicable, application and operational change control procedures should be integrated (see also 10.1.2). The change procedures should include:  a) maintaining a record of agreed authorization levels; b) ensuring changes are submitted by authorized users; c) reviewing controls and integrity procedures to ensure that they will not be compromised by the changes;  d) identifying all software, information, database entities, and hardware that require amendment; e) obtaining formal approval for detailed proposals before work commences; f) ensuring authorized users accept changes prior to implementation; g) ensuring that the system documentation set is updated on the completion of each change and that old documentation is archived or disposed of; h) maintaining a version control for all software updates; i) maintaining an audit trail of all change requests; f) an audit log should be maintained of all accesses to program source libraries; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 85 j) ensuring that operating documentation (see 10.1.1) and user procedures are changed as necessary to remain appropriate; k) ensuring that the implementation of changes takes place at the right time and does not disturb the business processes involved.  Other information Changing software can impact the operational environment.  Good practice includes the testing of new software in an environment segregated from both the production and development environments (see also 10.1.4). This provides a means of having control over new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for testing purposes.  This should include patches, service packs, and other updates. Automated updates should not be used on critical systems as some updates may cause critical applications to fail (see 12.6).  12.5.2 Technical review of applications after operating system changes Control When operating systems are changed, business critical applications should be reviewed and tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.   Implementation guidance This process should cover:  a) review of application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been compromised by the operating system changes; b) ensuring that the annual support plan and budget will cover reviews and system testing resulting from operating system changes; c) ensuring that notification of operating system changes is provided in time to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take place before implementation; d) ensuring that appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans (see clause 14). A specific group or individual should be given responsibility for monitoring vulnerabilities and vendors’ releases of patches and fixes (see 12.6). 12.5.3 Restrictions on changes to software packages Control Modifications to software packages should be discouraged, limited to necessary changes, and all changes should be strictly controlled.    Implementation guidance As far as possible, and practicable, vendor-supplied software packages should be used without modification. Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:  a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised; b) whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained; c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates; d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 86 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved If changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly identified copy.  A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software (see 12.6).  All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body. 12.5.4 Information leakage Control Opportunities for information leakage should be prevented.  Implementation guidance The following should be considered to limit the risk of information leakage, e.g. through the use and exploitation of covert channels:  a) scanning of outbound media and communications for hidden information; b) masking and modulating system and communications behaviour to reduce the likelihood of a third party being able to deduce information from such behaviour; c) making use of systems and software that are considered to be of high integrity, e.g. using evaluated products (see ISO/IEC 15408); d) regular monitoring of personnel and system activities, where permitted under existing legislation or regulation; e) monitoring resource usage in computer systems.  Other information Covert Channels are paths which are not intended to conduct information flows, but which may nevertheless exist in a system or network. For example, manipulating bits in communications protocol packets could be used as a hidden method of signaling. By their nature, preventing the existence of all possible covert channels would be difficult, if not impossible. However, the exploitation of such channels is often carried out by Trojan code (see also 10.4.1). Taking measures to protect against Trojan code therefore reduces the risk of covert channel exploitation.  Prevention of unauthorized network access (11.4), as well as policies and procedures to discourage misuse of information services by personnel (15.1.5), will help to protect against covert channels.  12.5.5 Outsourced software development Control Outsourced software development should be supervised and monitored by the organization.   Implementation guidance Where software development is outsourced, the following points should be considered:  a) licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2); b) certification of the quality and accuracy of the work carried out; c) escrow arrangements in the event of failure of the third party; d) rights of access for audit of the quality and accuracy of work done; e) contractual requirements for quality and security functionality of code; f) testing before installation to detect malicious and Trojan code.

Technical vulnerability management should be implemented in an effective, systematic, and repeatable way with measurements taken to confirm its effectiveness.  These considerations should include operating systems, and any other applications in use. 12.6.1  Control of technical vulnerabilities Control Timely information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used should be obtained, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated, and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk.  Implementation guidance A current and complete inventory of assets (see 7.1) is a prerequisite for effective technical vulnerability management. Specific information needed to support technical vulnerability management includes the software vendor, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what systems), and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software.  Appropriate, timely action should be taken in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities. The following guidance should be followed to establish an effective management process for technical vulnerabilities:  a) the organization should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required; b) information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other technology (based on the asset inventory list, see 7.1.1); these information resources should be updated based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are found; c) a timeline should be defined to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;  d) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, the organization should identify the associated risks and the actions to be taken; such action could involve patching of vulnerable systems and/or applying other controls;  e) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action taken should be carried out according to the controls related to change management (see 12.5.1) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 13.2);  f) if a patch is available, the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch);  g) patches should be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated; if no patch is available, other controls should be considered, such as  1) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;  2) adapting or adding access controls, e.g. firewalls, at network borders (see 11.4.5); 3) increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks; 4) raising awareness of the vulnerability; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 88 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved h) an audit log should be kept for all procedures undertaken; i) the technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency;   j) systems at high risk should be addressed first.  Other information The correct functioning of an organization’s technical vulnerability management process is critical to many organizations and should therefore be regularly monitored.  An accurate inventory is essential to ensure that potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities are identified.  Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 10.1.2 and 12.5.1).  Vendors are often under significant pressure to release patches as soon as possible. Therefore, a patch may not address the problem adequately and may have negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling a patch may not be easily achieved once the patch has been applied.  If adequate testing of the patches is not possible, e.g. because of costs or lack of resources, a delay in patching can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users.

Formal event reporting and escalation procedures should be in place. All employees, contractors and third party users should be made aware of the procedures for reporting the different types of event and weakness that might have an impact on the security of organizational assets.  They should be required to report any information security events and weaknesses as quickly as possible to the designated point of contact.   13.1.1 Reporting information security events Control Information security events should be reported through appropriate management channels as quickly as possible.  Implementation guidance A formal information security event reporting procedure should be established, together with an incident response and escalation procedure, setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a report of an information security event. A point of contact should be established for the reporting of information security events. It should be ensured that this point of contact is known throughout the organization, is always available and is able to provide adequate and timely response.  All employees, contractors and third party users should be made aware of their responsibility to report any information security events as quickly as possible.  They should also be aware of the procedure for reporting information security events and the point of contact.  The reporting procedures should include:  a) suitable feedback processes to ensure that those reporting information security events are notified of results after the issue has been dealt with and closed; b) information security event reporting forms to support the reporting action, and to help the person reporting to remember all necessary actions in case of an information security event; c) the correct behaviour to be undertaken in case of an information security event, i.e. 1) noting all important details (e.g. type of non-compliance or breach, occurring malfunction, messages on the screen, strange behaviour) immediately; 2) not carrying out any own action, but immediately reporting to the point of contact; d) reference to an established formal disciplinary process for dealing with employees, contractors or third party users who commit security breaches.   In high-risk environments, a duress alarm4 may be provided whereby a person under duress can indicate such problems.  The procedures for responding to duress alarms should reflect the high risk situation such alarms are indicating.                                                               4 A duress alarm is a method for secretly indicating that an action is taking place 'under duress.'   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 90 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Other Information Examples of information security events and incidents are:  a) loss of service, equipment or facilities, b) system malfunctions or overloads, c) human errors, d) non-compliances with policies or guidelines, e) breaches of physical security arrangements, f) uncontrolled system changes, g) malfunctions of software or hardware,  h) access violations. With due care of confidentiality aspects, information security incidents can be used in user awareness training (see 8.2.2) as examples of what could happen, how to respond to such incidents, and how to avoid them in the future.  To be able to address information security events and incidents properly it might be necessary to collect evidence as soon as possible after the occurrence (see 13.2.3).  Malfunctions or other anomalous system behavior may be an indicator of a security attack or actual security breach and should therefore always be reported as information security event.   More information about reporting of information security events and management of information security incidents can be found in ISO/IEC TR 18044. 13.1.2 Reporting security weaknesses Control All employees, contractors and third party users of information systems and services should be required to note and report any observed or suspected security weaknesses in systems or services.  Implementation guidance All employees, contractors and third party users should report these matters either to their management or directly to their service provider as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security incidents. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible, and available as possible. They should be informed that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected weakness.   Other Information Employees, contractors and third party users should be advised not to attempt to prove suspected security weaknesses.  Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and could also cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the individual performing the testing.  13.2 Management of information security incidents and improvements Objective: To ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information security incidents. Responsibilities and procedures should be in place to handle information security events and weaknesses effectively once they have been reported.  A process of continual improvement should be applied to the response to, monitoring, evaluating, and overall management of information security incidents. Where evidence is required, it should be collected to ensure compliance with legal requirements.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 91 13.2.1 Responsibilities and procedures Control Management responsibilities and procedures should be established to ensure a quick, effective, and orderly response to information security incidents.  Implementation guidance In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses (see also 13.1), the monitoring of systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities (10.10.2) should be used to detect information security incidents.  The following guidelines for information security incident management procedures should be considered:  a) procedures should be established to handle different types of information security incident, including:  1) information system failures and loss of service; 2) malicious code (see 10.4.1); 3) denial of service;  4) errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate business data; 5) breaches of confidentiality and integrity;  6) misuse of information systems. b) in addition to normal contingency plans (see 14.1.3), the procedures should also cover (see also 13.2.2):  1) analysis and identification of the cause of the incident;  2) containment; 3) planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, if necessary; 4) communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the incident;  5) reporting the action to the appropriate authority;  c) audit trails and similar evidence should be collected (see 13.2.3) and secured, as appropriate, for:  1) internal problem analysis;  2) use as forensic evidence in relation to a potential breach of contract breach or regulatory requirement or in the event of civil or criminal proceedings, e.g. under computer misuse or data protection legislation;  3) negotiating for compensation from software and service suppliers;  d) action to recover from security breaches and correct system failures should be carefully and formally controlled; the procedures should ensure that:  1) only clearly identified and authorized personnel are allowed access to live systems and data (see also 6.2 for external access);  2) all emergency actions taken are documented in detail; 3) emergency action is reported to management and reviewed in an orderly manner; 4) the integrity of business systems and controls is confirmed with minimal delay. The objectives for information security incident management should be agreed with management, and it should be ensured that those responsible for information security incident management understand the organization’s priorities for handling information security incidents.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 92 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Other information Information security incidents might transcend organizational and national boundaries.  To respond to such incidents there is an increasing need to coordinate response and share information about these incidents with external organizations as appropriate.   13.2.2 Learning from information security incidents Control There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of information security incidents to be quantified and monitored.    Implementation guidance The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to identify recurring or high impact incidents.  Other Information The evaluation of information security incidents may indicate the need for enhanced or additional controls to limit the frequency, damage, and cost of future occurrences, or to be taken into account in the security policy review process (see 5.1.2). 13.2.3 Collection of evidence Control Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident involves legal action (either civil or criminal) evidence should be collected, retained, and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).    Implementation guidance Internal procedures should be developed and followed when collecting and presenting evidence for the purposes of disciplinary action handled within an organization.  In general, the rules for evidence cover:  a) admissibility of evidence: whether or not the evidence can be used in court; b) weight of evidence: the quality and completeness of the evidence. To achieve admissibility of the evidence, the organization should ensure that their information systems comply with any published standard or code of practice for the production of admissible evidence.  The weight of evidence provided should comply with any applicable requirements. To achieve weight of evidence, the quality and completeness of the controls used to correctly and consistently protect the evidence (i.e. process control evidence); throughout the period that the evidence to be recovered was stored and processed should be demonstrated by a strong evidence trail. In general, such a strong trail can be established under the following conditions:  a) for paper documents: the original is kept securely with a record of the individual who found the document, where the document was found, when the document was found and who witnessed the discovery; any investigation should ensure that originals are not tampered with; b) for information on computer media: mirror images or copies (depending on applicable requirements) of any removable media, information on hard disks or in memory should be taken to ensure availability; the log of all actions during the copying process should be kept and the process should be witnessed; the original media and the log (if this is not possible, at least one mirror image or copy) should be kept securely and untouched. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 93 Any forensics work should only be performed on copies of the evidential material.  The integrity of all evidential material should be protected. Copying of evidential material should be supervised by trustworthy personnel and information on when and where the copying process was executed, who performed the copying activities and which tools and programs have been utilized should be logged.  Other information When an information security event is first detected, it may not be obvious whether or not the event will result in court action. Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident is realized. It is advisable to involve a lawyer or the police early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on the evidence required.  Evidence may transcend organizational and/or jurisdictional boundaries.  In such cases, it should be ensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as evidence. The requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission across the relevant jurisdictions.   ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 94 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 14 Business continuity management 14.1 Information security aspects of business continuity management Objective: To counteract interruptions to business activities and to protect critical business processes from the effects of major failures of information systems or disasters and to ensure their timely resumption.  A business continuity management process should be implemented to minimize the impact on the organization and recover from loss of information assets (which may be the result of, for example, natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, and deliberate actions) to an acceptable level through a combination of preventive and recovery controls. This process should identify the critical business processes and integrate the information security management requirements of business continuity with other continuity requirements relating to such aspects as operations, staffing, materials, transport and facilities.  The consequences of disasters, security failures, loss of service, and service availability should be subject to a business impact analysis. Business continuity plans should be developed and implemented to ensure timely resumption of essential operations.  Information security should be an integral part of the overall business continuity process, and other management processes within the organization. Business continuity management should include controls to identify and reduce risks, in addition to the general risks assessment process, limit the consequences of damaging incidents, and ensure that information required for business processes is readily available. 14.1.1 Including information security in the business continuity management process  Control A managed process should be developed and maintained for business continuity throughout the organization that addresses the information security requirements needed for the organization’s business continuity.  Implementation guidance The process should bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:   a) understanding the risks the organization is facing in terms of likelihood and impact in time, including an identification and prioritisation of critical business processes (see 14.1.2);  b) identifying all the assets involved in critical business processes (see 7.1.1); c) understanding the impact which interruptions caused by information security incidents are likely to have on the business (it is important that solutions are found that will handle incidents causing smaller impact, as well as serious incidents that could threaten the viability of the organization), and establishing the business objectives of information processing facilities;  d) considering the purchase of suitable insurance which may form part of the overall business continuity process, as well as being part of operational risk management;  e) identifying and considering the implementation of additional preventive and mitigating controls;  f) identifying sufficient financial, organizational, technical, and environmental resources to address the identified information security requirements;  g) ensuring the safety of personnel and the protection of information processing facilities and organizational property;  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 95 h) formulating and documenting business continuity plans addressing information security requirements in line with the agreed business continuity strategy (see 14.1.3);  i) regular testing and updating of the plans and processes put in place (see 14.1.5);  j) ensuring that the management of business continuity is incorporated in the organization’s processes and structure; responsibility for the business continuity management process should be assigned at an appropriate level within the organization (see 6.1.1).  14.1.2 Business continuity and risk assessment Control Events that can cause interruptions to business processes should be identified, along with the probability and impact of such interruptions and their consequences for information security.  Implementation guidance Information security aspects of business continuity should be based on identifying events (or sequence of events) that can cause interruptions to the organizations business processes, e.g. equipment failure, human errors, theft, fire, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. This should be followed by a risk assessment to determine the probability and impact of such interruptions, in terms of time, damage scale and recovery period.  Business continuity risk assessments should be carried out with full involvement from owners of business resources and processes. This assessment should consider all business processes and should not be limited to the information processing facilities, but should include the results specific to information security. It is important to link the different risk aspects together, to obtain a complete picture of the business continuity requirements of the organization. The assessment should identify, quantify, and prioritise risks against criteria and objectives relevant to the organization, including critical resources, impacts of disruptions, allowable outage times, and recovery priorities.  Depending on the results of the risk assessment, a business continuity strategy should be developed to determine the overall approach to business continuity. Once this strategy has been created, endorsement should be provided by management, and a plan created and endorsed to implement this strategy. 14.1.3 Developing and implementing continuity plans including information security Control Plans should be developed and implemented to maintain or restore operations and ensure availability of information at the required level and in the required time scales following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.  Implementation guidance The business continuity planning process should consider the following:   a) identification and agreement of all responsibilities and business continuity procedures;  b) identification of the acceptable loss of information and services;  c) implementation of the procedures to allow recovery and restoration of business operations and availability of information in required time-scales; particular attention needs to be given to the assessment of internal and external business dependencies and the contracts in place;  d) operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and restoration;  e) documentation of agreed procedures and processes;  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 96 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved f) appropriate education of staff in the agreed procedures and processes, including crisis management;  g) testing and updating of the plans.  The planning process should focus on the required business objectives, e.g. restoring of specific communication services to customers in an acceptable amount of time.  The services and resources facilitating this should be identified, including staffing, non-information processing resources, as well as fallback arrangements for information processing facilities. Such fallback arrangements may include arrangements with third parties in the form of reciprocal agreements, or commercial subscription services.   Business continuity plans should address organizational vulnerabilities and therefore may contain sensitive information that needs to be appropriately protected. Copies of business continuity plans should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at the main site. Management should ensure copies of the business continuity plans are up-to-date and protected with the same level of security as applied at the main site. Other material necessary to execute the continuity plans should also be stored at the remote location.  If alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these locations should be equivalent to the main site.  Other information It should be noted that crisis management plans and activities (see 14.1.3 f)) may be different from business continuity management; i.e. a crisis may occur that can be accommodated by normal management procedures. 14.1.4 Business continuity planning framework Control A single framework of business continuity plans should be maintained to ensure all plans are consistent, to consistently address information security requirements, and to identify priorities for testing and maintenance.  Implementation guidance Each business continuity plan should describe the approach for continuity, for example the approach to ensure information or information system availability and security.  Each plan should also specify the escalation plan and the conditions for its activation, as well as the individuals responsible for executing each component of the plan. When new requirements are identified, any existing emergency procedures, e.g. evacuation plans or fallback arrangements, should be amended as appropriate. Procedures should be included within the organization’s change management programme to ensure that business continuity matters are always addressed appropriately.   Each plan should have a specific owner. Emergency procedures, manual fallback plans, and resumption plans should be within the responsibility of the owners of the appropriate business resources or processes involved. Fallback arrangements for alternative technical services, such as information processing and communications facilities, should usually be the responsibility of the service providers.   A business continuity planning framework should address the identified information security requirements and consider the following:  a) the conditions for activating the plans which describe the process to be followed (e.g. how to assess the situation, who is to be involved) before each plan is activated;  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 97 b) emergency procedures, which describe the actions to be taken following an incident, which jeopardizes business operations; c) fallback procedures which describe the actions to be taken to move essential business activities or support services to alternative temporary locations, and to bring business processes back into operation in the required time-scales;  d) temporary operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and restoration;  e) resumption procedures which describe the actions to be taken to return to normal business operations;  f) a maintenance schedule which specifies how and when the plan will be tested, and the process for maintaining the plan;  g) awareness, education, and training activities which are designed to create understanding of the business continuity processes and ensure that the processes continue to be effective;  h) the responsibilities of the individuals, describing who is responsible for executing which component of the plan. Alternatives should be nominated as required;  i) the critical assets and resources needed to be able to perform the emergency, fallback and resumption procedures. 14.1.5 Testing, maintaining and re-assessing business continuity plans Control Business continuity plans should be tested and updated regularly to ensure that they are up to date and effective.  Implementation guidance Business continuity plan tests should ensure that all members of the recovery team and other relevant staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and information security and know their role when a plan is invoked.   The test schedule for business continuity plan(s) should indicate how and when each element of the plan should be tested. Each element of the plan(s) should be tested frequently.   A variety of techniques should be used in order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in real life. These should include:  a) table-top testing of various scenarios (discussing the business recovery arrangements using example interruptions);  b) simulations (particularly for training people in their post-incident/crisis management roles);  c) technical recovery testing (ensuring information systems can be restored effectively);  d) testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with recovery operations away from the main site);  e) tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and products will meet the contracted commitment);  f) complete rehearsals (testing that the organization, personnel, equipment, facilities, and processes can cope with interruptions).  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 98 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved These techniques can be used by any organization. They should be applied in a way that is relevant to the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve the plans, where necessary.   Responsibility should be assigned for regular reviews of each business continuity plan. The identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity plans should be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control process should ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of the complete plan.  Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in:  a) personnel;  b) addresses or telephone numbers;  c) business strategy;  d) location, facilities, and resources;  e) legislation;  f) contractors, suppliers, and key customers;  g) processes, or new or withdrawn ones;  h) risk (operational and financial).

The design, operation, use, and management of information systems may be subject to statutory, regulatory, and contractual security requirements. Advice on specific legal requirements should be sought from the organization’s legal advisers, or suitably qualified legal practitioners. Legislative requirements vary from country to country and may vary for information created in one country that is transmitted to another country (i.e. trans-border data flow). 15.1.1 Identification of applicable legislation Control All relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements and the organization’s approach to meet these requirements should be explicitly defined, documented, and kept up to date for each information system and the organization.  Implementation guidance The specific controls and individual responsibilities to meet these requirements should be similarly defined and documented. 15.1.2 Intellectual property rights (IPR) Control Appropriate procedures should be implemented to ensure compliance with legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements on the use of material in respect of which there may be intellectual property rights and on the use of proprietary software products.   Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be considered to protect any material that may be considered intellectual property:  a) publishing an intellectual property rights compliance policy which defines the legal use of software and information products; b) acquiring software only through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated;  c) maintaining awareness of policies to protect intellectual property rights, and giving notice of the intent to take disciplinary action against personnel breaching them; d) maintaining appropriate asset registers, and identifying all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights; e) maintaining proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc; f) implementing controls to ensure that any maximum number of users permitted is not exceeded; g) carrying out checks that only authorized software and licensed products are installed; h) providing a policy for maintaining appropriate licence conditions; i) providing a policy for disposing or transferring software to others; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 100 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved j) using appropriate audit tools; k) complying with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public networks; l) not duplicating, converting to another format or extracting from commercial recordings (film, audio) other than permitted by copyright law;  m) not copying in full or in part, books, articles, reports or other documents, other than permitted by copyright law. Other information Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents, and source code licenses.  Proprietary software products are usually supplied under a license agreement that specifies license terms and conditions, for example, limiting the use of the products to specified machines or limiting copying to the creation of back-up copies only.  The IPR situation of software developed by the organization requires to be clarified with the staff.  Legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements may place restrictions on the copying of proprietary material. In particular, they may require that only material that is developed by the organization, or that is licensed or provided by the developer to the organization, can be used. Copyright infringement can lead to legal action, which may involve criminal proceedings. 15.1.3 Protection of organizational records Control Important records should be protected from loss, destruction, and falsification, in accordance with statutory, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements.   Implementation guidance Records should be categorized into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, transaction logs, audit logs, and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods and type of storage media, e.g. paper, microfiche, magnetic, optical. Any related cryptographic keying material and programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures (see 12.3), should also be stored to enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of degradation of media used for storage of records. Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations.  For long term storage, the use of paper and microfiche should be considered.   Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access data (both media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be included, to safeguard against loss due to future technology change.  Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.  The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their retention period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the organization.  To meet these record safeguarding objectives, the following steps should be taken within an organization:  a) guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling, and disposal of records and information; ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 101 b) a retention schedule should be drawn up identifying records and the period of time for which they should be retained; c) an inventory of sources of key information should be maintained; d) appropriate controls should be implemented to protect records and information from loss, destruction, and falsification;  Other information Some records may need to be securely retained to meet statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements, as well as to support essential business activities. Examples include records that may be required as evidence that an organization operates within statutory or regulatory rules, to ensure adequate defense against potential civil or criminal action, or to confirm the financial status of an organization with respect to shareholders, external parties, and auditors. The time period and data content for information retention may be set by national law or regulation.  Further information about managing organizational records can be found in ISO 15489-1.  15.1.4 Data protection and privacy of personal information Control Data protection and privacy should be ensured as required in relevant legislation, regulations, and, if applicable, contractual clauses.  Implementation guidance An organizational data protection and privacy policy should be developed and implemented.  This policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of personal information.  Compliance with this policy and all relevant data protection legislation and regulations requires appropriate management structure and control. Often this is best achieved by the appointment of a person responsible, such as a data protection officer, who should provide guidance to managers, users, and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the specific procedures that should be followed. Responsibility for handling personal information and ensuring awareness of the data protection principles should be dealt with in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations.  Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information should be implemented.  Other information A number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing, and transmission of personal data (generally information on living individuals who can be identified from that information). Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls may impose duties on those collecting, processing, and disseminating personal information, and may restrict the ability to transfer that data to other countries. 15.1.5 Prevention of misuse of information processing facilities Control Users should be deterred from using information processing facilities for unauthorized purposes.  Implementation guidance Management should approve the use of information processing facilities. Any use of these facilities for non-business purposes without management approval (see 6.1.4), or for any unauthorized purposes, should be regarded as improper use of the facilities. If any unauthorized activity is identified by monitoring or other means, this activity should be brought to the attention of the individual manager concerned for consideration of appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action.  Legal advice should be taken before implementing monitoring procedures. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 102 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved  All users should be aware of the precise scope of their permitted access and of the monitoring in place to detect unauthorized use. This can be achieved by giving users written authorization, a copy of which should be signed by the user and securely retained by the organization. Employees of an organization, contractors, and third party users should be advised that no access will be permitted except that which is authorized.  At log-on, a warning message should be presented to indicate that the information processing facility being entered is owned by the organization and that unauthorized access is not permitted. The user has to acknowledge and react appropriately to the message on the screen to continue with the log-on process (see 11.5.1).  Other information The information processing facilities of an organization are intended primarily or exclusively for business purposes.    Intrusion detection, content inspection, and other monitoring tools may help prevent and detect misuse of information processing facilities.  Many countries have legislation to protect against computer misuse. It may be a criminal offence to use a computer for unauthorized purposes.  The legality of monitoring the usage varies from country to country and may require management to advise all users of such monitoring and/or to obtain their agreement.  Where the system being entered is used for public access (e.g., a public web server) and is subject to security monitoring, a message should be displayed saying so.  15.1.6 Regulation of cryptographic controls Control Cryptographic controls should be used in compliance with all relevant agreements, laws, and regulations.  Implementation guidance The following items should be considered for compliance with the relevant agreements, laws, and regulations:  a) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software for performing cryptographic functions; b) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software which is designed to have cryptographic functions added to it; c) restrictions on the usage of encryption; d) mandatory or discretionary methods of access by the countries’ authorities to information encrypted by hardware or software to provide confidentiality of content. Legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with national laws and regulations. Before encrypted information or cryptographic controls are moved to another country, legal advice should also be taken.  15.2 Compliance with security policies and standards and technical compliance Objective: To ensure compliance of systems with organizational security policies and standards. The security of information systems should be regularly reviewed. Such reviews should be performed against the appropriate security policies and the technical platforms and information systems should be audited for compliance with applicable security implementation standards and documented security controls. ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 103 15.2.1 Compliance with security policies and standards Control Managers should ensure that all security procedures within their area of responsibility are carried out correctly to achieve compliance with security policies and standards.  Implementation guidance Managers should regularly review the compliance of information processing within their area of responsibility with the appropriate security policies, standards, and any other security requirements.  If any non-compliance is found as a result of the review, managers should:  a) determine the causes of the non-compliance; b) evaluate the need for actions to ensure that non-compliance do not recur; c) determine and implement appropriate corrective action; d) review the corrective action taken.   Results of reviews and corrective actions carried out by managers should be recorded and these records should be maintained.  Managers should report the results to the persons carrying out the independent reviews (see 6.1.8), when the independent review takes place in the area of their responsibility.   Other information Operational monitoring of system use is covered in 10.10. 15.2.2 Technical compliance checking Control Information systems should be regularly checked for compliance with security implementation standards.  Implementation guidance Technical compliance checking should be performed either manually (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, and/or with the assistance of automated tools, which generate a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist.  If penetration tests or vulnerability assessments are used, caution should be exercised as such activities could lead to a compromise of the security of the system. Such tests should be planned, documented and repeatable.   Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by competent, authorized persons, or under the supervision of such persons.  Other information Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure that hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance checking requires specialist technical expertise.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) 104 © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, which might be carried out by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can be useful in detecting vulnerabilities in the system and for checking how effective the controls are in preventing unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities.  Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments provide a snapshot of a system in a specific state at a specific time.  The snapshot is limited to those portions of the system actually tested during the penetration attempt(s).  Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are not a substitute for risk assessment. 15.3 Information systems audit considerations Objective: To maximize the effectiveness of and to minimize interference to/from the information systems audit process. There should be controls to safeguard operational systems and audit tools during information systems audits. Protection is also required to safeguard the integrity and prevent misuse of audit tools. 15.3.1 Information systems audit controls Control Audit requirements and activities involving checks on operational systems should be carefully planned and agreed to minimize the risk of disruptions to business processes.  Implementation guidance The following guidelines should be observed:  a) audit requirements should be agreed with appropriate management; b) the scope of the checks should be agreed and controlled; c) the checks should be limited to read-only access to software and data; d) access other than read-only should only be allowed for isolated copies of system files, which should be erased when the audit is completed, or given appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such files under audit documentation requirements; e) resources for performing the checks should be explicitly identified and made available; f) requirements for special or additional processing should be identified and agreed; g) all access should be monitored and logged to produce a reference trail; the use of time-stamped reference trails should be considered for critical data or systems; h) all procedures, requirements, and responsibilities should be documented; i) the person(s) carrying out the audit should be independent of the activities audited. 15.3.2 Protection of information systems audit tools Control Access to information systems audit tools should be protected to prevent any possible misuse or compromise.  Implementation guidance Information systems audit tools, e.g. software or data files, should be separated from development and operational systems and not held in tape libraries or user areas, unless given an appropriate level of additional protection.  ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2005(E) © ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved 105 Other information If third parties are involved in an audit, there might be a risk of misuse of audit tools by these third parties, and information being accessed by this third party organization.  Controls such as 6.2.1 (to assess the risks) and 9.1.2 (to restrict physical access) can be considered to address this risk, and any consequences, such as immediately changing passwords disclosed to the auditors, should be taken.

Although the material presented in a TIR may need further evaluation by experts, releasing the information is valuable because the industry and the professions have an immediate need for it. A TIR differs markedly from a standard or recommended practice, and readers should understand the differences between these documents. Standards and recommended practices are subject to a formal process of committee approval, public review, and resolution of all comments. This process of consensus is supervised by the AAMI Standards Board and, in the case of American National Standards, by the American National Standards Institute. A TIR is not subject to the same formal approval process as a standard. However, a TIR is approved for distribution by a technical committee and the AAMI Standards Board.  Another difference is that, although both standards and TIRs are periodically reviewed, a standard must be acted on—reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn—and the action formally approved usually every five years but at least every 10 years. For a TIR, AAMI consults with a technical committee about five years after the publication date (and periodically thereafter) for guidance on whether the document is still useful—that is, to check that the information is relevant or of historical value. If the information is not useful, the TIR is removed from circulation. A TIR may be developed because it is more responsive to underlying safety or performance issues than a standard or recommended practice, or because achieving consensus is extremely difficult or unlikely. Unlike a standard, a TIR permits the inclusion of differing viewpoints on technical issues. CAUTION NOTICE: This AAMI TIR may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Because it addresses a rapidly evolving field or technology, readers are cautioned to ensure that they have also considered information that may be more recent than this document. All standards, recommended practices, technical information reports, and other types of technical documents developed by AAMI are voluntary, and their application is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Occasionally, voluntary technical documents are adopted by government regulatory agencies or procurement authorities, in which case the adopting agency is responsible for enforcement of its rules and regulations.

The United States is one of the IEC members that took an active role in the development of this technical report.  International technical report IEC/TR 80001-2-4:2012 was developed jointly by Sub-Committee IEC/SC 62A, Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice and ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, to define the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security.  U.S. participation in this IEC SC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A administered by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. AAMI administers the International Secretariat for IEC/SC 62A on behalf of the United States, and U.S. experts made a considerable contribution to this International Technical Report.  AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with International Standards in the area of risk management of information technology as it relates to medical devices.  The AAMI Information Technology Working Group together with the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, reviewed IEC/TR 80001-2-4 to formulate the U.S. position and comments while the document was being developed. This close collaboration helped gain widespread U.S. consensus on the document. As the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, AdvaMed granted AAMI permission to consider adoption of IEC/TR 80001-2-4 as a new AAMI Technical Information Report. Following AAMI procedures, the AAMI Information Technology Working Group voted to adopt the IEC technical report as written.  AAMI has adopted other IEC and ISO documents. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of IEC and ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the IEC and ISO standard.  The concepts incorporated in this technical information report should not be considered inflexible or static. This technical information report, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new data comes to light.  Publication of this Technical Report that has been registered with ANSI has been approved by the Accredited Standards Developer (AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633). This document is registered as a Technical Report according to the Procedures for the Registration of Technical Reports with ANSI.

The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The main task of IEC technical committees is to prepare International Standards. However, a technical committee may propose the publication of a technical report when it has collected data of a different kind from that which is normally published as an International Standard, for example "state of the art". IEC 80001-2-4, which is a technical report, has been prepared by a Joint Working Group of subcommittee 62A: Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, of IEC technical committee 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice and ISO technical committee 215: Health informatics. The text of this technical report is based on the following documents: AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  ix Enquiry draft Report on voting 62A/818/DTR 62A/835/RVC Full information on the voting for the approval of this technical report can be found in the report on voting indicated in the above table.

AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016x  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012 INTRODUCTION This technical report is a guide to help a HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION (see 1.2) fulfilling its obligations as a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION in the application of IEC 80001-1, in conjunction with other technical reports in this series. Specifically, this guide helps the HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION assess the impact of the standard on the organization and establish a series of business as usual PROCESSES to manage RISK in the creation, maintenance and upkeep of its MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. Whilst this document is aimed solely at HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATIONS, the term RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is used throughout this document to ensure consistency with IEC 80001-1. In this respect the two terms are synonymous. This technical report will be useful to those responsible for establishing an IEC 80001-1 compliant RISK MANAGEMENT framework within a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION that is expecting to establish one or more MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. In particular, the RISK MANAGEMENT framework should address the KEY PROPERTIES – SAFETY, DATA AND SYSTEM SECURITY and EFFECTIVENESS –as defined in IEC 80001-1. The purpose of the framework is to ensure that the potential problems associated with the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS, identified in IEC 80001-1, are avoided. Defining and implementing the RISK MANAGEMENT framework and the business change that can result, will require the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to draw upon a range of skills from within the organization, managerial, clinical and technical. Where such skills are not available within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION, consideration should be given to collaboration with similar organizations or through experts in the field. It is important that the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION be able to draw upon expertise with respect to appropriate standards and their corresponding technical reports. In establishing a RISK MANAGEMENT framework, a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will need to take account of: – the size and capabilities of the organization; – the extent of its IT operations and the complexity of its current infrastructure and systems; and – the cost of implementing IEC 80001-1. It is expected that some of the above factors, for example size of IT operations and complexity of the networks, will be proportionate to the size of the organization. It is important that the framework itself does not create patient RISK by placing unnecessary demands on clinical staff, yet at the same time this workload should not introduce avoidable new RISKS when implementing a new technology. In taking a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION through the key decisions and steps required to successfully establish a RISK MANAGEMENT framework for MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS this document refers to small and large organizations. These are subjective terms, for which no precise measures are given, though: • a small organization could be a doctor's practice with: – a few clinicians, or – with many clinicians, a consolidated IT function and a highly centralized governance structure  • a large organization could be: – a multi-hospital conglomerate, or – an organization with distributed clinics and a mixture of in-house and outsourced clinical and IT governance.  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  xi Small organizations may also find the guidance identified under large organization relevant. The RISK MANAGEMENT framework developed by a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION following the guidance in this technical report needs to fit into the formal management systems that are routinely used for normal business: the business as usual PROCESSES. Such business as usual PROCESSES need to ensure RISK MANAGEMENT is part of the on-going requirement when systems are changed or new systems are deployed by: – including the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES in the existing management PROCESSES, for example the organization's Quality Management System; – ensuring that the internal audit schedule includes the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES; – making sure RISK MANAGEMENT training is included on induction of new staff and provided to existing staff; and – ensuring RISK MANAGEMENT is undertaken for both new work and changes to existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. Having established a RISK MANAGEMENT framework, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will be ready to undertake a detailed RISK ASSESSMENT (see IEC/TR 80001-2-1 [1]).

The steps are supported by a series of decision points to steer the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION through the PROCESS of understanding the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK context and identifying any organizational changes required to execute the responsibilities of TOP MANAGEMENT as defined in Figure 1 of IEC 80001-1:2010.  HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION 1.2This technical report is addressed to all HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATIONS. A HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION includes hospitals, doctors’ offices, community care homes and clinics. In the provision of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK containing a MEDICAL DEVICE within a HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION there can be a number of RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS. For the purpose of this document the focus is the HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION and its obligations with respect to IEC 80001-1. It is important for the HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION to identify the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION(S) responsible for any aspect of the network which is subject to IEC 80001-1. This allows a clear assignment of the roles and responsibilities of that standard.  Field of application 1.3This technical report details the steps to be undertaken by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION in implementing the requirements of 3.1 to 3.3 and 4.1 to 4.6 of IEC 80001-1:2010. NOTE It is assumed that the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will consider IEC/TR 80001-2-1 [1] for detailed advice in satisfying 4.4 of IEC 80001-1:2010.  Prerequisites 1.4The International Standard IEC 80001-1:2010 is prerequisite to this technical report. The guidance in this technical report is intended to help a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION establish a RISK MANAGEMENT framework to satisfy the underlying requirements of IEC 80001-1, ensuring: – RISK MANAGEMENT policy and PROCESSES are in place; AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/20162  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012 – probability, severity, and RISK acceptability scales are specified; and – MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS are well defined. 2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application.

Note 1 to entry: The definition of a device for in vitro examination includes, for example, reagents, calibrators, sample collection and storage devices, control materials, and related instruments or apparatus. The information provided by such an in vitro diagnostic device may be for diagnostic, monitoring or compatibility purposes. In some jurisdictions, some in vitro diagnostic devices, including reagents and the like, may be covered by separate regulations. Note 2 to entry: Products which may be considered to be MEDICAL DEVICES in some jurisdictions but for which there is not yet a harmonized approach, are: – aids for disabled/handicapped people; – devices for the treatment/diagnosis of diseases and injuries in animals; – accessories for MEDICAL DEVICES (see Note 3 to entry); – disinfection substances; – devices incorporating animal and human tissues which may meet the requirements of the above definition but are subject to different controls. Note 3 to entry: Accessories intended specifically by manufacturers to be used together with a ‘parent’ medical DEVICE to enable that MEDICAL DEVICE to achieve its intended purpose should be subject to the same GHTF procedures as apply to the MEDICAL DEVICE itself. For example, an accessory will be classified as though it is a MEDICAL DEVICE in its own right. This may result in the accessory having a different classification than the ‘parent’ device. Note 4 to entry: Components to MEDICAL DEVICES are generally controlled through the manufacturer’s quality management system and the conformity assessment procedures for the device. In some jurisdictions, components are included in the definition of a ‘MEDICAL DEVICE’.

It is good practice for the TOP MANAGEMENT to appoint a sufficiently independent function to oversee the effective operation of RISK MANAGEMENT practices in the organization. The steps described in this report will generally be executed by a team of individuals within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. It is recommended to have representation from multiple departments, including IT, biomedical engineering, clinical, and RISK MANAGEMENT. The makeup of the team should align with existing structures within the organization. This can include consideration of patient SAFETY and network security. Senior clinicians should be included in the creation of this function and thereafter advise on the clinical impact of IT-NETWORK related HAZARDS as part of a RISK ASSESSMENT. Suitable links to the organization's teams responsible for clinical governance or clinical accountability should also be put in place. TOP MANAGEMENT needs to ensure the following functions are done:  – define and document the organization's RISK MANAGEMENT policy. This policy will need to address the KEY PROPERTIES; – create and disseminate suitable RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. These PROCESSES can be linked to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION’s clinical SAFETY management system, its quality management system or its enterprise RISK MANAGEMENT system, where these exist; – establish RISK acceptability criteria to determine which RISKS are tolerable to the organization. The criteria will take into account relevant: • regulations (e.g. EU Directives);  • international standards; • national standards; • regional standards; and • professional (e.g. clinical) guidelines – ensure that a staged approach is taken to the deployment and use of MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS such that the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES can be efficiently and effectively applied, consistent with the complexity of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK being deployed. This approach should require TOP MANAGEMENT to sign off each stage; and – review the suitability of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES at planned, regular intervals to ensure the continuing EFFECTIVENESS of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES and document any decisions and actions taken. Both large and small organizations should commence their IEC 80001-1 implementation by opening a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE which should act as a focus for all of the organization’s activities in this area. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE can be used as a means to demonstrate the organization’s compliance with the requirements of IEC 80001-1 as part of an audit activity.  Small RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION – points to consider 4.2When evaluating TOP MANAGEMENT functions, a small organization should consider the following points: AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/20168  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012 – Do we have any systems which interface with MEDICAL DEVICES? Is IEC 80001-1 applicable to us at this moment in time? Do we have future plans for integrating MEDICAL DEVICES into our IT infrastructure? – Can we safely phase our compliance plans over a longer period of time, thereby reducing the immediate burden on resources? – Are there any similar RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS in the area with whom we could share resources and jointly establish IEC 80001-1 compliance? Do we know of similar RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS who are already compliant and would share their experiences? – How do we establish an accurate inventory for IT operations? Do we have a proper design for our IT-NETWORKS and any exiting MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS? Where does the boundary exist between MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and our routine IT systems? – Do we have a formal PROCESS to make these compliance decisions? Do we have a suitable repository, for example a quality management system, in which we can incorporate the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES? How are we going to prepare such PROCESSES? – Have we an existing staff member (manager or administrator) who can assume the additional responsibilities of MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER? How do we get our staff suitably trained in RISK MANAGEMENT?  Large RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION – points to consider 4.3When evaluating TOP MANAGEMENT functions, a large organization should consider the following points in addition to the points identified for a small organization above: – Where does RISK MANAGEMENT responsibility sit within our organization? Who should own the RISK MANAGEMENT policy? How is clinical governance related? – How do the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES fit into the organization’s quality management system? Where will the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES and policy sit? – How can RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS be divided into manageable sub-PROCESSES and how should these sub-PROCESSES be coordinated? – Do we need a specific IEC 80001-1 compliance project? Do we need to appoint a project manager and establish a project team? – What are our IT support arrangements? Which suppliers are impacted by these requirements? Have we communicated supplier responsibilities properly? 5 RISK MANAGEMENT implementation steps  Overview 5.1This subclause looks at the RISK MANAGEMENT framework and prerequisite work to be undertaken by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION before it embarks on the detailed RISK ASSESSMENT of a new or changing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The three steps proposed in this document to implement IEC 80001-1, are: – determine the clinical context within which the healthcare provision is made (see 5.2); – establish an underlying RISK MANAGEMENT framework (see 5.3); and – determine and understand existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK(S) (see 5.4). These three steps are explored in greater detail in the following subclauses. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  9  Determine the clinical context within which the healthcare provision is made 5.2The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION must establish a clear understanding of the purpose of the organization from a clinical perspective. In deriving this understanding the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION could consider the following: – the clinical needs of patients the organization provides services for; – the nature of the clinical services provided by the organization and the PROCESSES involved with each of those clinical services; and – clinical staffing and competencies.  Establish underlying RISK framework 5.3There is a requirement for the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to define a RISK MANAGEMENT framework and to put PROCESSES in place before commencing a detailed RISK ASSESSMENT. A RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION should consider what PROCESSES are needed to support the RISK MANAGEMENT activities. For example, these PROCESSES need to be commensurate with the size of organization, the clinical context and the level of IT operations. In determining the extent of the PROCESSES to be developed, or existing PROCESSES to be updated, the organization should ensure that the areas identified in IEC 80001-1 are addressed as a minimum. These areas include: – RISK MANAGEMENT (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclauses 4.2.2 and 4.4); – CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 4.5.1); – CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 4.5.1); – RISK MANAGEMENT planning (IEC 80001-1, subclauses 4.3.5 and 4.5.2.3); – go-live (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 4.5.3); – monitoring (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 4.6.1); and – EVENT MANAGEMENT (IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 4.6.2). In formulating the PROCESSES that govern the RISK MANAGEMENT work there are some principles which will help to guide and keep a clear focus on the needs of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION including: – Free from additional RISK: The work should not itself introduce additional RISK, for example by disrupting clinicians and over burdening them whilst they are responsible for delivering care to patients. – Light touch: The RISK MANAGEMENT controls should avoid overly bureaucratic PROCESSES and be commensurate to the level of RISK identified as part of a subsequent RISK ASSESSMENT. – Ownership: Has the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION assigned suitable personnel to assess and own the RISKS? For example, clinicians own the clinical PROCESSES and are therefore well placed to assess the severity of HARM. They should be consulted regularly to ratify the RISK ASSESSMENT decisions and conclusions. – Consistent: RISK MANAGEMENT activities should sit comfortably alongside clinical governance measures in the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION and align with relevant national professional clinical standards and regulatory/legal requirements. – Net RISK: The introduction of a new MEDICAL IT-NETWORK will be a trade-off between RISKS; it will help remove or mitigate and the inherent RISKS that the new technology brings. In some AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201610  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012 circumstances, for example capital investment, it might be incumbent on the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to demonstrate that the introduction of a new system will have a net reduction in RISK to the patient and the organization. This demonstration will require the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to assess both the old and the new systems in accordance with the RISK MANAGEMENT framework.  Determining and understanding a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK 5.4 Performing a RISK ASSESSMENT 5.4.1Performing a RISK ASSESSMENT requires a detailed understanding of the way in which the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK delivers its services. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION must form a clear understanding of each MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, its boundary, its interfaces, what data flows across and within them and how that information is used. Within the context of this document, a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK can consist of: – an individual, discrete MEDICAL DEVICE connected directly to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION'S IT-NETWORK; – several discrete MEDICAL DEVICES connected directly to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION'S IT-NETWORK; or – a self-contained MEDICAL IT-NETWORK which is connected in its entirety to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION'S IT-NETWORK. In reviewing each MEDICAL IT-NETWORK the following aspects should be considered: – the configuration of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK including a clear definition of the equipment constituting the network and the functions they provide, the machine and human interfaces and what data is exchanged across these interfaces (described in 5.4.2); – the development status of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK (described in 5.4.3); – who provides the equipment (described in 5.4.4); and – what level of support is available (described in 5.4.5). When undertaking the above, a large RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION should consider the following points: – Is there a logical candidate pilot? Establishing a large and complex MEDICAL IT-NETWORK is quite difficult for any organization. A useful technique is the use of a pilot project to prove the new PROCESSES. – How do we identify the correct people to gather the information? This question should be considered before gathering the information. Establishing a multi-disciplined team to answer the technical and clinical questions that will arise is best done from the outset. Contact arrangements can be put in place and agreements with line managers made, thereby preventing a loss of impetus later in the PROCESS.  MEDICAL IT-NETWORK configuration 5.4.25.4.2.1 Understanding of the components of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK A RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will need to form a good understanding of the components of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and their interaction. For example, the actual MEDICAL DEVICE, all of the connected systems, the nature of their connectivity and interrelationship and the broader network services such as backup. Note that subclause 4.3.2 of IEC 80001-1:2010 requires an organization to establish a list of assets. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  11 The effort required to gather the information will be proportionate to the complexity of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and how well it has been documented to date. The type of network can also require the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to work closely with other organizations. In determining the configuration of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, the following views could be constructed; additional views may also be assembled as required: – Physical view: a diagram including the MEDICAL DEVICE(S), other systems and key interfaces (both human and machine). This view should clearly show the boundary of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. – Data view: a diagram showing the flow of clinical data around the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, for example a data flow diagram. – PROCESS view: This could be a list of services, provided by the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and its associated MEDICAL DEVICES. A service could be a pathology result. It is important to understand the associated roles and tasks for the services provided. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK being considered, from the physical view, will fall into one of the following categories: a) Standalone: the classic single-system/small number of users, small dedicated MEDICAL IT-NETWORK which a small RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION would typically use. This category would also apply to the type of small specialist MEDICAL IT-NETWORK found in highly specialist departments in a large RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION, which are segregated from the main site network (for example, in the pathology laboratory). b) Collaborative: where two or more RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONs link their relatively simple and discrete standalone systems within a broader interoperable context. It is recommended that the details of the collaborations are recorded in addition to the details for the simple standalone systems. c) Centralized: a typical centralized MEDICAL IT-NETWORK would exist in a large hospital, where a central IT department manages the network and services associated with a number of clinical specialties. The specialties themselves have dedicated network services from this central provision and are given access to applications which support the administrative and potentially clinical areas of care delivery. These networks will invariably interface with MEDICAL DEVICES to some degree. The level of complexity of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK is an order of magnitude greater than would be seen in a small RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. Care should be taken to be clear about the separation between clinical domains as in the centralized context some common MEDICAL IT-NETWORK components will be shared across different MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. Examples for these configurations are presented in Annex A. The purpose of establishing the physical view in terms of the above configurations is to ensure that an accurate model of the MEDICAL IT NETWORK is derived for the RISK ASSESSMENT, especially in terms of connected systems and associated interfaces.  Whilst the nature of the configuration does not change the basic RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS it will be helpful in determining the potential HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. 5.4.2.2 Small RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION – points to consider For a small organization, the biggest threat here is becoming overwhelmed by the quantity of information being collated. It is therefore important to avoid over complication at this stage. There are a few simple questions which will help a small organization to understand the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK: AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201612  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012 – Do we have an asset register? How accurate is it? The asset register is a useful starting point for identifying the equipment within a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. It does, however, need to be accurate. If it is not, then there is a good chance that a portion of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK will fall out of scope of the RISK ASSESSMENT and therefore compromise the SAFETY of the whole MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. – Can we supplement the asset register with markers to show MEDICAL DEVICES? If possible, you should try to mark the asset register with an indicator for those MEDICAL DEVICES which make up part of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. This will make things easier to maintain and give considerable help when assessing the impact of changes to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. – What MEDICAL DEVICEs do we have in our RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION? MEDICAL DEVICEs are labeled as such and should come with a Certificate of Conformance from the manufacturer together with an ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT; do you have these? If you have issues in this area, suppliers’ websites can carry this documentation. In addition, Regulatory Agencies provide useful databases covering current systems approvals. – What interfaces exist between the MEDICAL DEVICE and our broader system(s)? Before you can progress to a RISK ASSESSMENT, you need a clear understanding of the clinical information passing to and from any MEDICAL DEVICE. Clearly, the starting point for this piece of work is an understanding of what is, or is not, a MEDICAL DEVICE. 5.4.2.3 Large RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION – points to consider It is important before commencing this exercise in a large organization to differentiate between a regulated standalone MEDICAL DEVICE and a regulated MEDICAL DEVICE which interfaces with other systems via a network. It is important to remember that the focus of IEC 80001-1 is the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, and whilst good practice would dictate that a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has good PROCESSES and inventory around controlling standalone MEDICAL DEVICES, the subject of this document is how to implement IEC 80001-1. Establishing the configuration in a large organization will be a complex undertaking and the following points, in addition to those specified above for a small organization, should be considered: – What help can the specialist clinical function offer in establishing an accurate picture? A good place to find out information on MEDICAL DEVICES in radiology is to ask the radiologists and associated clinical staff who use the systems on a daily basis. Specialist clinical users should be consulted within each MEDICAL IT-NETWORK domain to properly capture the regulatory picture and their knowledge of working practices and the equipment. – What help can the technical functions (IT and biomed) offer? Many failure modes of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK are technical in nature and require the expertise of technical functions to both identify failure modes as well as to evaluate the likelihood of the failure. – What help can the RISK MANAGEMENT function offer? Although the interpretation of RISK is slightly different with respect to the quantification of HAZARDS and that generally used by project managers, those conversant with a RISK approach will be able to assist in ensuring RISKS are defined, documented and controlled. – What help can the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION’s clinical governance team provide? A RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION should have a clinical governance and compliance team who will have a good perspective on the regulatory environment in the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. – Can we break up the MEDICAL DEVICES we have into associated clinical domains? It is important to ensure that the organization captures the correct clinical context within which the MEDICAL DEVICE is operating. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK configuration views benefit from simplification if the MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS can be separated into clustered interrelated clinical domains. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  13 – Do we have any common MEDICAL DEVICEs which interact across the organization? When gathering the configuration information, MEDICAL DEVICES which are operating across several clinical settings should be identified. The analysis of the MEDICAL DEVICES within an IT-NETWORK can be of use in the assessment of other IT-NETWORKS containing the same MEDICAL DEVICE.  Development status of MEDICAL IT-NETWORK 5.4.3It is important that a RISK ASSESSMENT uses information which correctly reflects the current status of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, as this will significantly influence the approach taken to mitigate the RISKS. In defining the development status of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK the following classifications should be considered: – Existing: stable and unchanged baselined MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The purpose of the RISK ASSESSMENT is to identify any inherent RISKS and establish the EFFECTIVENESS of any prevailing controls or mitigations associated with the deployed and operation of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. – Modification: stable baselined MEDICAL IT-NETWORK onto which one or more changes are being introduced. The purpose of the assessment is to identify the impact of the changes and to examine their impact on existing RISK CONTROL measures. – Under development: new or existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK where components are substantially new. The purpose of the assessment is to identify any potential RISKS associated with the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK under development and to ensure that adequate controls or mitigations are implemented to ensure the RISKS are within the agreed acceptability criteria. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION needs to consider the development status of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and make a reasoned judgment as to which status is relevant, along with a corresponding consideration of the RISK ASSESSMENT approach.  Manufacturer identification 5.4.4Once the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has quantified its MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS, it is necessary to identify the manufacturers of the various components. Completion of this activity will ensure that all component manufacturers have been identified. The responsibilities of manufacturers and providers are defined in subclauses 3.5 and 3.6 of IEC 80001-1:2010, respectively. Points to consider for any size of organization: – Is the manufacturer the same as the supplier? – Do our procurement PROCESSES ensure the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION gets access to any supporting information? This could be from the manufacturer or from the supplier if these are different organizations. – Who can request information from a manufacturer / supplier? – Who can commission (or compel if necessary) a manufacturer / supplier to take action to mitigate a RISK? – What is the complexity of the supply chain, for example, the use of sub-contractors? AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/201614  © 2013 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-4:2012  External IT and bio-medical engineering support 5.4.5It is important that the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION ensures proper RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS are in place with external support organizations in order to ensure adequate support and mitigation of any identified RISKS associated with components of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK (see Clause 6). In this section IT is related to the basic network components rather than the MEDICAL DEVICE. In order to clarify the support model it is useful to consider how the service is operated and maintained. To do this a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will need to consider the following questions: – Which organizations are responsible for providing support? – Do we have support contracts in place with each of these organizations? – Are we clear which services are delivered in support of the network and its components (for example, the range of basic support tasks like resetting forgotten passwords to provision of new desktop computers) under each contract? – Is the support adequate for our current and potential future needs? 6 RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS IEC 80001-1:2010, subclause 3.2 states that "The overall responsibility for RISK MANAGEMENT for a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK shall stay within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION”. To fulfill this responsibility, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will need the timely input of information from its manufacturers. Ensuring the availability of this material can be achieved through RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS.

The first example (A.2) represents the system configurations 1a and 1b from Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1. The subsequent three examples (A.3 to A.5) are variations of system configuration 2b, from Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1:2010, with increasing complexity. Within the following diagrams the MEDICAL DEVICE being connected to the general purpose IT NETWORK is shown as a collection of equipment on its own specific network. Equally the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK could consist of a one or more discrete MEDICAL DEVICES connected directly to the general purpose IT NETWORK. A.2 Isolated network configuration The example presented in Figure A.1 is comparable to system configuration 1 described in Table C.1 of IEC 80001-1:2010. As this example is not explicit as to whether the equipment is sourced from one or more MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers, the interpretation is equally applicable to system configurations 1a and 1b. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a provider of radiological services for a small community. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a single facility and is not associated with any other RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has two segregated networks operating within the facility. The first is a general purpose IT network that is used for the day-to-day business applications. The second is a MEDICAL DEVICE network comprising diagnostic imaging equipment that was installed by a single MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer. As these networks are independent from one another, this configuration is outside the scope of IEC 80001-1.

The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a provider of radiological services for a small community. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is a single facility and is not associated with any other RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has two networks operating within the facility. The first is a general purpose IT network that is used for the day-to-day business applications. The second is a MEDICAL DEVICE network comprising diagnostic imaging equipment that was purchased from MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers. These two networks have been connected together to form a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK.

The objectives of AAMI's technical development program derive from AAMI's overall mission: the advancement of medical instrumentation. Essential to such advancement are (1) a continued increase in the safe and effective application of current technologies to patient care, and (2) the encouragement of new technologies. It is AAMI's view that standards and recommended practices can contribute significantly to the advancement of medical instrumentation, provided that they are drafted with attention to these objectives and provided that arbitrary and restrictive uses are avoided. A voluntary standard for a medical device recommends to the manufacturer the information that should be provided with or on the product, basic safety and performance criteria that should be considered in qualifying the device for clinical use, and the measurement techniques that can be used to determine whether the device conforms with the safety and performance criteria and/or to compare the performance characteristics of different products. Some standards emphasize the information that should be provided with the device, including performance characteristics, instructions for use, warnings and precautions, and other data considered important in ensuring the safe and effective use of the device in the clinical environment. Recommending the disclosure of performance characteristics often necessitates the development of specialized test methods to facilitate uniformity in reporting; reaching consensus on these tests can represent a considerable part of committee work. When a drafting committee determines that clinical concerns warrant the establishment of minimum safety and performance criteria, referee tests must be provided and the reasons for establishing the criteria must be documented in the rationale.  A recommended practice provides guidelines for the use, care, and/or processing of a medical device or system. A recommended practice does not address device performance per se, but rather procedures and practices that will help ensure that a device is used safely and effectively and that its performance will be maintained. Although a device standard is primarily directed to the manufacturer, it may also be of value to the potential purchaser or user of the device as a frame of reference for device evaluation. Similarly, even though a recommended practice is usually oriented towards healthcare professionals, it may be useful to the manufacturer in better understanding the environment in which a medical device will be used. Also, some recommended practices, while not addressing device performance criteria, provide guidelines to industrial personnel on such subjects as sterilization processing, methods of collecting data to establish safety and efficacy, human engineering, and other processing or evaluation techniques; such guidelines may be useful to health care professionals in understanding industrial practices. In determining whether an AAMI standard or recommended practice is relevant to the specific needs of a potential user of the document, several important concepts must be recognized: All AAMI standards and recommended practices are voluntary (unless, of course, they are adopted by government regulatory or procurement authorities). The application of a standard or recommended practice is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Each AAMI standard or recommended practice reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care professionals and industrial representatives, whose work has been reviewed nationally (and sometimes internationally). As such, the consensus recommendations embodied in a standard or recommended practice are intended to respond to clinical needs and, ultimately, to help ensure patient safety. A standard or recommended practice is limited, however, in the sense that it responds generally to perceived risks and conditions that may not always be relevant to specific situations. A standard or recommended practice is an important reference in responsible decision-making, but it should never replace responsible decision-making. Despite periodic review and revision (at least once every five years), a standard or recommended practice is necessarily a static document applied to a dynamic technology. Therefore, a standards user must carefully review the reasons why the document was initially developed and the specific rationale for each of its provisions. This review will reveal whether the document remains relevant to the specific needs of the user. Particular care should be taken in applying a product standard to existing devices and equipment, and in applying a recommended practice to current procedures and practices. While observed or potential risks with existing equipment typically form the basis for the safety and performance criteria defined in a standard, professional judgment must be used in applying these criteria to existing equipment. No single source of information will serve to identify a particular product as "unsafe". A voluntary standard can be used as one resource, but the ultimate decision as to product safety and efficacy must take into account the specifics of its utilization and, of course, cost-benefit considerations. Similarly, a recommended practice should be analyzed in the context of the specific needs and resources of the individual institution or firm. Again, the rationale accompanying each AAMI standard and recommended practice is an excellent guide to the reasoning and data underlying its provision. In summary, a standard or recommended practice is truly useful only when it is used in conjunction with other sources of information and policy guidance and in the context of professional experience and judgment.  INTERPRETATIONS OF AAMI STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES  Requests for interpretations of AAMI standards and recommended practices must be made in writing, to the AAMI Vice President, Standards Policy and Programs. An official interpretation must be approved by letter ballot of the originating committee and subsequently reviewed and approved by the AAMI Standards Board. The interpretation will become official and representation of the Association only upon exhaustion of any appeals and upon publication of notice of interpretation in the "Standards Monitor" section of the AAMI News. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation disclaims responsibility for any characterization or explanation of a standard or recommended practice which has not been developed and communicated in accordance with this procedure and which is not published, by appropriate notice, as an official interpretation in the AAMI News.

The United States is one of the ISO members that took an active role in the development of this standard.  International standard ISO 15225:2010 was developed by Technical Committee ISO/TC 210, Quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices to provide rules and guidelines for a medical device nomenclature data structure in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange of data used by regulatory bodies on an international level between interested parties such as regulatory authorities, manufacturers, suppliers, health care providers, and end users.  U.S. participation in this ISO TC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for ISO/TC 210, administered by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. The U.S. made a considerable contribution to this International Standard.  AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with International Standards in the area of quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices.  Upon review of ISO 15225, the Quality Management and Corresponding General Aspects for Medical Devices Committee and the AAMI Symbols and Nomenclature Working Group decided to adopt it verbatim, as a revision of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2000/(R)2006 and its 2004 amendment.  This edition of ISO 15225 has been technically revised from the previous edition and includes definitions for base concept, collective term, device category, device type, generic device group, GMDN, GMDN agency, multiple-linked synonym, product specifier and template specifier.  Annex A contains three new codes and updated descriptions based on examples of new technologies.  Annex D has been added which contains examples of collective terms.     AAMI and ANSI procedures require that standards be reviewed and, if necessary, revised every five years to reflect technological advances that may have occurred since publication.  AAMI (and ANSI) have adopted other ISO standards. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the ISO standard.  As used within the context of this document, “shall” indicates requirements strictly to be followed to conform to the recommended practice. “Should” indicates that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action should be avoided but is not prohibited. “May” is used to indicate that a course of action is permissible within the limits of the recommended practice. “Can” is used as a statement of possibility and capability. Finally, “must” is used only to describe “unavoidable” situations, including those mandated by government regulation.  The concepts incorporated in this standard should not be considered inflexible or static. This standard, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new data comes to light.  Suggestions for improving this standard are invited. Comments and suggested revisions should be sent to Standards Department, AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Dr. Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633. NOTE—Beginning with the ISO foreword on page ix, this American National Standard is identical to ISO 15225:2010.   viii  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO 15225 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 210, Quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 15225:2000), which has been technically revised. It also incorporates the Amendment ISO 15225:2000/Amd.1:2004.  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  ix AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Introduction This International Standard is intended to assist competent authorities, conformity assessment bodies, healthcare providers and manufacturers in the submission and exchange of information. It is intended that the information covered by this International Standard be available in the public domain.

These stages differ in the breadth of the sets of devices represented by the terms defined within each stage. All medical devices can be classified within each stage. The stages have a relational structure in the following order: a) device category (see 4.2); b) collective term (see 4.3); c) generic device group (see 4.4); d) device type (see 4.5). 4.2 Device category Individual categories have broad usage definitions representing disparate devices that have common areas of intended use or common technology. Device category has the largest number of devices covered by each term. For data organization, device category includes the record holding a device category term and associated data, such as its code and other attributes. 4.3 Collective term Collective terms are terms used in the nomenclature for: a) grouping together preferred terms with common characteristics, e.g. common technology, materials, medical specialties, manufacturing processes; NOTE  Collective terms can replace or support template terms. b) illustrating the scope of certificates issued by certification bodies when assessing which groups, families or types of medical devices are covered within a manufacturer’s quality system; c) identifying the range of skills and general technological abilities for which a notified body has been approved, and is so appointed by the relevant regulatory authority; d) exchanging of information between regulatory authorities when general information on individual manufacturers capabilities is notified for inclusion within data-exchange systems. Collective terms are linked directly to preferred terms. 4.4 Generic device group A generic device group contains sets of devices having the same or similar intended uses or commonality of technology. Sets of devices are grouped together for the purpose of device vigilance reporting, or other purposes where sets of essentially similar devices from different sources need to be collected. Potentially, any device attribute (e.g. implant/non-implant, sterile/non-sterile) can be used as a means of arranging associated data. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  5 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 For data organization, the generic device group includes the record holding a device group term. The device group term can include the following: a) preferred term (see 5.2.3); b) template term (see 5.2.4); c) synonym (see 5.2.5); d) multiple-linked synonym (see 5.2.6). It can also include associated data, as follows: ⎯ code; ⎯ definition; ⎯ for synonyms or multiple-linked synonyms, code of the generic device group record holding the preferred term or template term; ⎯ for templates, the template specifier. 4.5 Device type A device type contains individual medical devices including devices intended for clinical investigation, devices intended for performance evaluation and custom-made devices or sets of medical devices including variants which may be produced. Device types contain sufficient characteristics in common for the manufacturer to establish a make and model. For data organization, device type includes the record holding the device type designation and its associated data, such as its code and other attributes. Names to be stored are drawn from the manufacturer’s documentation. 4.6 Nomenclature structure example Table 1 is an example of the nomenclature structure. 6 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Table 1 — Example of GMDN structure linked to an alignment rod Device categories: 03 Dental devices 09 Reusable devices Links to - -   Collective terms:   CT465 Cranial surgery  CT146 Dentistry  CT317 Infant/pediatric  CT321 Long-term surgical invasive  CT326 Manually powered/operated  CT177 Metals  CT328 Natural orifice  CT166 Oral surgical fixation/distraction and ancillary  CT152 Pediatrics  CT982 Reusable  CT335 Single purpose  CT334 Single-patient use  CT337 Sterilizable  CT233 Surgery Links to - -  Generic device group: GMDN code:47677 Term: Craniofacial alignment rod Definition: A surgical instrument typically used in pairs to facilitate correct cranial orientation of craniofacial implants (e.g., fixation plates being attached to jaw bones) and other devices (e.g. craniofacial distractors) during their application in craniofacial surgery. It is typically designed as a long, thin, rigid rod made of high-grade stainless steel or titanium alloy with connectors at either end for attachment to the devices being aligned; it may have a knurled mid section (to provide better grip) onto which other instruments can be locked to assist the orientation procedure. This is a reusable device.

The list is not exhaustive, other device categories may be added (see Annex A). © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  7 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 5.2 Generic device group 5.2.1 General Generic device groups are managed by the GMDN agency and are part of the data file. For the generation of generic device group terms, see Annex B. A generic device group can be a member of more than one device category. The nomenclature shall consist of preferred terms, template terms, synonyms and multiple-linked synonyms. All terms should be given in the singular form. 5.2.2 Abbreviations and acronyms Abbreviations and acronyms can be used to create generic device group names. Any abbreviation being adopted should use widely recognized terminology. 5.2.3 Preferred term A preferred term represents a device type or a set of device types that perform similar or equivalent functions or have technical characteristics in common. A preferred term is the only term that can be used for product identification. A preferred term shall be unambiguous and comprise the following: a) base concept; b) (if appropriate) one or more qualifiers following the base concept, and which are separated from the base concept by a comma; c) a comma and one space to delimit each qualifier. EXAMPLE Brachytherapy system applicator, remote afterloading, bladder. More specific classification can be achieved by addition of further qualifiers. The base concept shall be the primary listing basis. Unambiguous qualifiers shall be used. Ambiguous qualifiers include phrases such as “sundries”, “others”, “appliances”, “miscellaneous” and “various”. Trade names shall not be used as preferred terms. Preferred terms shall be assigned a definition of not more than 700 characters. 5.2.4 Template terms A template term is used when more than two preferred terms are formed using the same base concept. 8 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 The template term shall be formed from the common base concept followed by the qualifier <specify>. A template term functions only as a navigational term within the nomenclature. Its permanency cannot be guaranteed due to preferred term development. Template terms cannot be used for product identification. Template terms shall not be used as synonyms. Template terms shall be assigned a definition of not more than 700 characters. 5.2.5 Synonyms Synonyms shall be linked to only one preferred term or to one template term, whichever is appropriate. Synonyms are an aid to locating the appropriate preferred term. Synonym terms cannot be used for product identification. Synonyms shall not be linked to other synonyms. 5.2.6 Multiple-linked synonyms A multiple-linked synonym is a term that is typically of a higher order, and can therefore be linked to more than one preferred term, or template term, or preferred term and template term. EXAMPLE 1 Higher order terms EDMA term: Thyroid Function Hormones GMDN related terms: Triiodothyronine uptake kit  Thyroxine kit  Triiodothyronine kit  Free triiodothyronine kit  Free thyroxine kit. EXAMPLE 2 Combination product terms UMDNS term: Reagents, Staphylococcus/Streptococcus Detection GMDN related terms:  Staphylococcus kit  Streptococcus antibody kit  Streptococcus antigen kit. A multiple-linked synonym shall have the same construction format and status as a synonym term. Multiple-linked synonym terms may not be used for the purpose of product identification. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  9 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 5.3 Device type Device types are used to identify a manufacturer’s specific product (i.e. make and model) and are managed by, or on behalf of, the device manufacturer. A device type shall not be linked to more than one preferred term. Device types shall be designated under the code of a preferred term, in accordance with the primary intended uses specified by the manufacturer. 5.4 Collective term Collective terms shall group several preferred terms with common features (see 4.3). Collective terms are managed by the GMDN Agency and are part of the data file. See Annex D. 6 Data file dictionary 6.1 General This clause is provided for information system designers implementing the nomenclature within a database. It provides the minimum requirements for the data fields needed to hold the nomenclature system. Each stage in the data structure is represented by a data file for which the requirements of 6.2 to 6.5 apply. Further data fields may be added to all data files depending on the requirements of the end user of the database system in question. The character set for transmissions shall be the Latin alphabet No. 1 as specified in ISO/IEC 8859-1. 6.2 Device category data file The minimum number of fields shall be as specified in Table 2. The rationale for having two primary keys is that the code will be used to facilitate automatic translation between natural language versions of the terms stored in this data file. See Annex A for examples. When information is exchanged and records in the data files described in Table 2 are part of this information, then only the code of the relevant records needs to be transmitted. Table 2 — Requirements for device category data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Code Numeric, two digits Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 60 characters Primary key Definition Alphanumeric, 1,260 characters — 10 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016  6.3 Generic device group data file The data field code shall be assigned an incremental sequential cardinal number starting from the value 10,000. After a new record is added to the data file, the code shall be incremented by one (1). The generic device group data file shall be as specified in Table 3. Table 3 — Requirements for generic device group data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Code Numeric, five digits Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 120 charactersPrimary key Synonym code Numeric, five digits If not equal to zero (nil) then this device group is a synonym where the numeric value is the code of the preferred term or template. Template specifier Numeric, two digits If not equal to zero (nil) then this device group is a template. The numeric value represents how many characters from the term are to be used for looking up (listing) the matching preferred term base concept. Definition Alphanumeric, max 700 characters See also 5.2. Product specifier Alpha, 30 characters The text “product identifier” or “not for product identification” is linked to all terms to make it clear tothe nomenclature user which terms are allowed for product identification and which are not. NOTE Annex C gives examples of device group records.  The rationale for having two primary keys is that the code will be used to facilitate automatic translation between natural language versions of the terms stored in this data file. There is no foreign key in this data file relating it to the device category data file, since there is a many-to-many relation between these two data files. The system designer should apply the method(s) available in the database tool in order to achieve this many-to-many relation, the most common method being a data file holding as foreign keys the codes of both the device category and generic device group records. The code of the generic device group’s records, where the synonym code or the template specifier is not zero (nil), shall not be used as a foreign key in related data files. These records may not be available in all natural language versions of the nomenclature system and in such cases no relation will exist (see Annex C). Generic device group codes in the range 1 to 9,999 cannot be used in data transmissions that comply with this International Standard. This demands that an official list of generic device groups will never contain records having these code values. Generic device group codes in the range 1 to 9,999 are exclusively reserved for assignment by the end user. These codes are made available for the convenience of end users to store terms outside the scope of this International Standard. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  11 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 6.4 Device type data file The minimum number of fields shall be as specified in Table 4. Table 4 — Requirements for device type data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Generic device group code Numeric, five digits Foreign key, represents the link to a generic device group record (preferred term in the nomenclature) Make Alphanumeric, 60 characters Secondary key, can also act as a foreign key Model Alphanumeric, 60 characters The make and model represents, when concatenated, the primary key When concatenated (see Table 4) the contents of the data fields “make” and “model” shall be unique. The data field “make” is used to identify the manufacturer on the device label. When appropriate, the authorized representative may be identified. A shortened version, such as an easily recognizable trade name or alpha-numeric trade mark, may be used. The data field model should be the name used by the manufacturer to identify the particular type of device. In appropriate circumstances, other informative formats, such as brand or bar code data, may be used. This data field should not be confused with the serial number or lot number assigned to the individual device or lots of devices. The reasoning for having two data fields representing the primary key is that the model name used by one manufacturer (or even by the same manufacturer when he uses several makes to represent his name) could possibly be used by other manufacturers, thus making it unsuitable for use as a primary key. The system designer may find it useful to assign a single (numeric) data field as a more manageable primary key in the database system for this data file. Each device type record should be supported by a unique code for data transmission. If it is considered of value to include device risk class data, this should be limited to links at the device type. Risk classification at the generic device group level is not considered in this International Standard. 6.5 Collective term data file The minimum number of identifiers shall be as specified in Table 5. Table 5 — Requirements for collective term data file Identifier Data category and format (maximum) Comments Code Alphanumeric, six characters Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 150 characters Primary key Definition Alpha, 300 characters —  The collective term code consists of two alpha characters, followed by up to four numeric characters.

The terms used in the examples provided are for illustrative purposes. B.2 Structure of generic device group terms The preferred term should be of such a character that the nomenclature acquires a functional architecture, bearing in mind the users and use of the device. The qualifier, especially when common to many terms, may be based on the properties, characteristics or field of use of the devices, by using well-established conventions when appropriate. The general structure of the preferred term is the base concept (singular noun or noun phrase), followed by one or more qualifiers (adjectives or adjectival phrases), delimited or separated by a comma. The base concept is the broadest representation of the generic device group of medical devices that is further described by the qualifiers. The qualifiers, moving from left to right, should be ordered from broader (less specific) to narrower (more specific). B.3 Examples of generic device group terms B.3.1 A preferred term should be constructed in the following manner: Base concept qualifier qualifier Noun or noun phrase adjective or adjectival phrase adjective or adjectival phrase  B.3.2 The following are examples of preferred terms structured by base concept followed by qualifier. EXAMPLE 1 Suture, nylon. EXAMPLE 2 Suture, polyethylene. EXAMPLE 3 Suture, polyglyconate. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  17 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 B.3.3 The following are examples of preferred terms using a qualifier which reflects the “field of use” of the devices to be named by the term. EXAMPLE 1 Hemofiltration system. EXAMPLE 2 Peritoneal dialysis system. EXAMPLE 3 Hemodialysis system. EXAMPLE 4 Hemodialysis system air bubble/foam guard. EXAMPLE 5 Hemodialysis system bicarbonate mixer. B.3.4 Where there are more than two preferred terms with the same base concept, a template may be introduced. EXAMPLE 1 Audiometer, <specify>. EXAMPLE 2 Audiometer, auditory evoked response. EXAMPLE 3 Audiometer, automatic-recording. EXAMPLE 4 Audiometer, computer-controlled. B.3.5 The following are examples of synonyms: EXAMPLE 1 Dinamap “linked to” Sphygmomanometer, electronic, <specify> EXAMPLE 2 AED (automatic external defibrillator) “linked to” Defibrillator, automatic EXAMPLE 3 Ambu bag “linked to” Resuscitator, pulmonary, <specify> B.3.6 Any definition should be written in a manner that makes it comprehensible to all nomenclature users. EXAMPLE 1 Audiometer, <specify> An electroacoustic device designed for the measurement of hearing, most commonly for measuring the hearing threshold level. It uses controlled levels of test tones and signals to conduct diagnostic hearing evaluations and assist in the diagnosis of possible otological disorders. EXAMPLE 2 Audiometer, automatic, computer-controlled An electroacoustic device designed to measure the hearing threshold of a patient by presenting tones of increasing or decreasing intensity through headphones to establish the level at which the patient first becomes aware of the sounds. A computer or microprocessor in the device automatically produces tones that sweep the audiometric scale and controls tone intensity and frequency. The device also records the patient's responses and may display calculated hearing thresholds. This device may have the capacity to present a fixed frequency or a steadily changing frequency. It may also provide both continuous and pulsed tone outputs. 18 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 B.4 Abbreviations The following are examples of abbreviations used in, or as part of, a synonym: EXAMPLE 1 AARK (automated anaesthesia record keeper).

Although the material presented in a TIR may need further evaluation by experts, releasing the information is valuable because the industry and the professions have an immediate need for it. A TIR differs markedly from a standard or recommended practice, and readers should understand the differences between these documents. Standards and recommended practices are subject to a formal process of committee approval, public review, and resolution of all comments. This process of consensus is supervised by the AAMI Standards Board and, in the case of American National Standards, by the American National Standards Institute. A TIR is not subject to the same formal approval process as a standard. However, a TIR is approved for distribution by a technical committee and the AAMI Standards Board.  Another difference is that, although both standards and TIRs are periodically reviewed, a standard must be acted on—reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn—and the action formally approved usually every five years but at least every 10 years. For a TIR, AAMI consults with a technical committee about five years after the publication date (and periodically thereafter) for guidance on whether the document is still useful—that is, to check that the information is relevant or of historical value. If the information is not useful, the TIR is removed from circulation. A TIR may be developed because it is more responsive to underlying safety or performance issues than a standard or recommended practice, or because achieving consensus is extremely difficult or unlikely. Unlike a standard, a TIR permits the inclusion of differing viewpoints on technical issues. CAUTION NOTICE: This AAMI TIR may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Because it addresses a rapidly evolving field or technology, readers are cautioned to ensure that they have also considered information that may be more recent than this document. All standards, recommended practices, technical information reports, and other types of technical documents developed by AAMI are voluntary, and their application is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Occasionally, voluntary technical documents are adopted by government regulatory agencies or procurement authorities, in which case the adopting agency is responsible for enforcement of its rules and regulations.

The United States is one of the ISO members that took an active role in the development of this technical report. International Technical Report ISO TR 80001-2-7 Ed.1 was developed jointly by Sub-Committee IEC/SC 62A, Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice and ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, to define the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security. U.S. participation in this IEC SC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, administered by AAMI on behalf of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with international documents as much as possible. The AAMI Information Technology Working Group, together with the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, reviewed ISO TR 80001-2-7 Ed.1 to formulate the U.S. position while the document was being developed. This close collaboration helped gain widespread U.S. consensus on the document. As the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, the AAMI Information Technology Networks Working Group voted to adopt the IEC Technical Report as written. AAMI has adopted other ISO documents. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the ISO standard. The concepts incorporated into this technical report should not be considered inflexible or static. This technical information report, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new date comes to light. Publication of this Technical Report that has been registered with ANSI has been approved by the Accredited Standards Developer (AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633). This document is registered as a Technical Report according to the Procedures for the Registration of Technical Reports with ANSI.

The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. In exceptional circumstances, when a technical committee has collected data of a different kind from that which is normally published as an International Standard (“state of the art”, for example), it may decide by a simple majority vote of its participating members to publish a Technical Report. A Technical Report is entirely informative in nature and does not have to be reviewed until the data it provides are considered to be no longer valid or useful. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

This technical report can be used to assess Medical IT-Network projects where IEC 80001-1 has been determined to be applicable. This technical report provides an exemplar assessment method which includes a set of questions which can be used to assess the performance of risk management of a Medical IT-Network incorporating a medical device. This assessment method can be used in its presented form or can be tailored to meet the needs of a specific HDO. A Process Reference Model (PRM) and an example Process Assessment Model (PAM) that meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2 are included in the Appendices of this technical report The PRM and PAM can be used to provide a standardized basis for tailoring the exemplar assessment method where required.  This Technical Report can be used in a number of ways including: 1)The assessment method can be used to perform an assessment to determine conformance against IEC 80001-1.2)In instances where conformance has been established, the assessment method can also be used to assessrisk management processes and determine the capability level at which these processes are being performed.3)Based on the context of the HDO being assessed, the assessment method can be tailored to address theindividual HDO use, needs and concerns.The results of the assessment will highlight any weaknesses within current risk management processes and can be used as a basis for the improvement of these processes. Where necessary, modification of the assessment method can be undertaken with reference to the PRM and PAM for IEC 80001-1 which are also included in this Technical Report. This approach allows for a lightweight assessment approach to which more rigour can be added if required. For example, a re-assessment may be required in instances where an initial assessment revealed weaknesses in the current risk management processes and improvements have subsequently been made which require re-assessment to assess their impact on conformance. A re-assessment may also be performed in instances where confirmation is required that process improvement measures which have been undertaken have resulted in the achievement of a higher capability level.

When performing an assessment, it is preferable to have more than one assessor. In cases where the assessment is performed by more than one assessor, a lead assessor should be nominated. The need for multiple assessors is determined by the context of the HDO and the system under assessment. The context of the HDO and the scope of the assessment also determine the need for the modification of the presented exemplar assessment method. In addition, to performing the assessment, the assessor should consider interacting with all relevant risk management stakeholders both those internal and external to the HDO. The assessor should also have access to all relevant materials related to the performance of risk management activities.  4.2 Assessment Method Overview The use of an assessment method allows assessments to be performed in a consistent and repeatable manner. The assessment method which is presented in this technical report is based on the processes and practices as defined in the PRM and PAM which are presented in the appendices of this technical report. Figure 1 shows the 14 processes and their respective process categories which are contained in the PAM. The PAM, which can be found in Annex C of this technical report, provides a full description of these processes including the activities (base practices) which must be performed to successfully achieve the purpose of the process. The assessment method consists of an approach to perform the assessment and a set of questions which allows the assessor to collect objective evidence to support an assessment of how each of the activities are being performed (and support the assignment of a capability rating to each process). On the basis of the evidence gathered during the assessment, the strengths and weaknesses of the processes can be identified and recommendations can be made to improve risk management practices and conformance with IEC 80001-1.

A 7 stage procedure for the performance of the assessment has been defined. Each of the stages is described in the following sections of this clause: AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/2016© 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 3 4.3.1 Stage 1 – Defining Assessment Scope This is the initial planning stage of the assessment. During this stage of the assessment, the lead assessor meets with Top Management and the scope of the assessment is defined. This stage can be used to define to which Medical IT-Networks IEC 80001-1 is applicable. The system (or IT network modification project) which is to be the focus of the assessment is defined and the context of the system is understood. Risk management stakeholders should be identified. Risk management stakeholders are both internal (e.g. clinical engineering) and external (e.g. medical device manufacturers) to the HDO. The lead assessor should ensure that Top Management sponsors the assessment and that all relevant risk management stakeholders are available to participate for the duration of the assessment process. 4.3.2 Stage 2 – Stakeholder Involvement Having secured the commitment of all relevant risk management stakeholders to participate in the assessment process, the lead assessor meets with risk management stakeholders to explain the assessment method. The lead assessor explains the agreed scope of the assessment and explains how the assessment is to be conducted and how findings from the assessment are to be communicated. As risk management stakeholders consist of members from a cross disciplinary team, the lead assessor ensures that all stakeholders are clear on what their participation in the assessment involves. A sample template which can be used to record the information collected in stages1 and 2 of the assessment process is provided in Annex A.2.2. 4.3.3 Stage 3 – Information Collection and Evaluation During this stage of the assessment, the lead assessor interviews various risk management stakeholders using a set of scripted questions (for the exemplar assessment questions see Annex A Clause A.1) and evaluates the responses. Group interviews should be used where possible to gain an understanding of risk management processes from varying stakeholder perspectives. A combination of individual and group interviews may be used. To facilitate the recording of the responses, a second assessor may be used to take notes on the interviews. Additional questions may be required if clarification is necessary. The assessor uses the questions to promote discussion on risk management practices which are currently in place. At this stage, the lead assessor can also inspect work products related to risk management activities and evaluate these work products on the basis of the assessment questions.  A sample template which can be used to record the information collected during the interviews which are performed in stage 3 of the assessment process is provided in Annex A.2.3 4.3.4 Stage 4 – Findings Report A findings report is drafted based on the data gathered during stage 3. The lead assessor reviews the interview notes and evaluates the responses to the scripted questions and any available work products. Having reviewed the evidence gathered during the assessment, the lead assessor generates a rating for the response to the questions based on the Process Attribute Rating Scale as detailed in subclause 4.4 of this technical report. In the case of an assessment to assess conformance, the findings report should state whether conformance to the standard (based on an assessment of all 14 processes) has been achieved. On the basis of the evidence gathered during the assessment the lead assessor identifies strengths and weaknesses within the current risk management practices. The lead assessor includes in the findings report a set of recommendations to address identified issues and which can be implemented in order to improve risk management practices and facilitate the improvement of risk management processes. A sample template which can be used to draft the findings report which is prepared during stages 3 of the assessment process is provided in Annex A.2.3 4.3.5 Stage 5 – Presentation of Findings The findings report is presented by the lead assessor to Top Management and risk management stakeholders who have taken part in the assessment. At this stage, a date for a reassessment can be agreed. Stages 1 to 5 above complete the assessment process. Where a follow-up assessment is required, stages 6 and 7 below can be performed. A reassessment can be used to confirm that the recommendations for improvements to the risk management process have improved risk management processes as envisaged.

On the basis of the report, a plan for improvements to the risk management process is agreed. The plan should include specific improvement objectives and discussion and timelines for the implementation of the identified improvements. 4.3.7 Stage 7- Follow-up Assessment (optional) A follow-up assessment can be performed to ensure that improvements to the risk management processes have been implemented. The reassessment, if required, can be performed on the same project or on a similar Medical IT-Network project to assess if improvements to the process have been made and the impact of these improvements. For example, a reassessment can be initiated in instances where conformance was not determined to have been achieved in the previous assessment and improvements have been made to address the weaknesses. The reassessment determines if the implemented improvements have achieved conformance. A reassessment can also be initiated to confirm that improvements (identified and implemented as a result of the previous assessment) have resulted in the achievement of a higher capability level for a specific process or processes. The scope of the reassessment depends on the weaknesses highlighted in the previous assessment and as such can address all processes or a subset of processes.  4.4 Process Attribute Rating Scale 4.4.1 When performing an assessment of the capability of risk management processes, each of the base practices is reviewed using objective evidence gathered during assessment interviews and through examination of work products. On the basis of this review, each of the base practices can be assigned a rating. The capability level of the process is based on the average rating of the base practices related to the process. ISO/IEC 15504-2 defines six capability levels from Level 0 (Incomplete Process) to Level 5 (Optimizing Process) and defines attributes of the process that are associated with the achievement of each of the capability levels. An assessment of conformance seeks to confirm that all processes are being performed at Capability Level 1 (Performed Process). For achievement of Capability Level 1, it must be determined during the assessment that risk management processes (as defined within the PAM in Annex C) are being performed in a manner that the purpose of all processes has been achieved. Process performance and capability attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 are discussed in detail in Annex C, subclause C.2.3 – Table C.1. When performing an assessment of risk management processes at all capability levels, the process attribute rating scale as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 should be used. The extent of achievement of a process attribute is measured using an ordinal scale of measurement as defined subclause 4.42. 4.4.2 The ordinal rating scale defined below shall be used to express the levels of achievement (process attribute rating values) of the process attributes. N Not achieved There is little or no evidence of achievement of the defined attribute in the assessed process. P  Partially achieved There is some evidence of an approach to and some achievement of, the defined attribute in the assessed process. Some aspects of achievement of the attribute may be unpredictable. L Largely achieved There is evidence of a systematic approach to and significant achievement of, the defined attribute in the assessed process. Some weakness related to this attribute may exist in the assessed process. F Fully achieved There is evidence of a complete and systematic approach to and full achievement of, the defined attribute in the assessed process. No significant weaknesses related to this attribute exist in the assessed process. The ordinal points defined above shall be understood in terms of a percentage scale representing extent of achievement. The corresponding values shall be: N Not achieved 0 to 15 % achievement P Partially achieved >15 % to 50 % achievement L Largely achieved  >50 % to 85% achievement F  Fully achieved  >85 % to 100 % achievement AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/2016© 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 5 4.5 Capability Levels The exemplar assessment method which is provided in this technical report allows HDO’s to assess their current risk management processes. The focus of the exemplar assessment method is to allow for an assessment to be perfomed to identify areas of the risk management processes which are not being performed in accordance with the requirements of IEC 80001-1 (i.e. processes which have not achieved level 1 capability) and allow recommendations to be made to allow for a level 1 capability level to be achieved. The exemplar assessment method uses a set of scripted questions, each of which are related to specific base practices as outlined in the PAM, to review risk management processes and identify any weaknesses within the current processes in line with the achievement of level 1 capability.Through the identification of weaknesses in the current process and the implementation of recommendations to address these weaknesses, capability levels upper than 1 may be achieved. The exemplar assessment method provided can also be used to assess against capability levels upper than 1 through the use of the capability level assessment as outlined in the PAM in Annex C which contains a full explanation of all capability levels and the associated assessment indicators which can be reviewed in assessing against capability levels upper than level 1. 4.6 Tailoring the Assessment Method The exemplar assessment method as outlined in this technical report provides a sample set of questions for use in the assessment of IEC 80001-1 risk management processes. The set of questions provided is intended as a guide who can then be tailored for use in a specific HDO context. The questions should be reviewed on the basis of the context of the HDO in question and amendments made to take into account any variation that are specific to the HDO. The exemplar questions which are provided are based on the base practices as outlined within the PAM in Annex C. To tailor the assessment method questions, the base practices on which the questions are based should be reviewed by the assessor. The questions can then be modified, removed or additional questions added as required by the individual context of the HDO. The assessor should ensure that they are fully aware of the HDO context in order to tailor the questions appropriately. The assessor should also ensure that the questions continue to be related to the base practices as described in the PAM. As the base practices within the PAM describe high level activities that shall be performed in order to achieve the process purpose, they can be used as the basis for more specific questions related to the HDO context. Using this approach ensures that assessments take into account individual HDO context while performing a consistent approach to the assessment of the process purpose and the requirements of IEC 80001-1. It should be noted that the assessment of a single base practice may require the use of more than one question. The use of the scripted questions in the assessment method is intended to be used as a tool to initiate a discussion on current risk movement processes and allow the assessor to collect objective evidence to support the achievement of a specific capability level. To facilitate the assessors ability to gain an understanding of current risk management processes, additional questions may be posed by the assessor which are not contained in the assessment method to support the judgement of the achievement of the capability level. The assessor may also review documentation which is generated by the performance of risk management activities at this stage.

The assessment questions are based on the base practices related to each process. For each process, the questions are provided along with some guidance for the assessor on points which should be considered when asking the questions. Where more information on a specific base practice is provided in another technical report in the IEC 80001-1 series, details of the technical report and the relevant section are provided. Details of the technical reports which have been published are provided in the bibliography section of this technical report. It should be noted that where a specific technical report is appropriate to the context of the network (e.g. a wireless network) then this technical report should be consulted in full prior to the commencement of an assessment of the risk analysis processes related to this network. This set of questions is intended as a starting point for performing an assessment and are based on the base practices which are included in the PAM. Additional questions can be added to this set and asked during the assessment if clarification or additional information is required. This set of questions can also be modified to include questions which address the specific context of a particular HDO or a particular geographical region. These questions are intended to be used to perform an assessment against capability level 1. Additional questions can be added to address capability levels upper than 1. An explanation of capability levels is provided in the PRM and PAM which can be found in Annex B and Annex C of this technical report. Each question relates to a specific base practice within a specific process within the PAM. To facilitate traceability between the PAM and the assessment questions each question has a unique identifier e.g. MRM.1 BP1 Q.1. The code consists of the process ID which is used in the PRM and PAM (e.g. MRM.1), the base practice number (e.g. BP1), and the question number (e.g. Q.1).AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/2016© 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 7 A.1.2 MRM.1 Medical IT-Network Risk Management Process Table A.1 — MRM.1 BP1 MRM.1 BP1: Establish a Medical IT-Network Risk Management File.

The PAM is described in Annex C. ISO/IEC 15504-2 describes the requirements for the conduct of an assessment and a measurement scale for assessing process capability. ISO/IEC 15504-1 describes the concepts and terminology used for process assessment. ISO/IEC TR 24774 provides guidelines for process description. These standards have been used to inform the development of both the PRM and PAM.  This PRM is a logical representation of the elements of the processes within the risk management process for the incorporation of medical devices into IT-Networks. Using the PRM in a practical application might require additional elements suited to the environment and circumstances. The PRM specified in this technical report describes at an abstract level the processes including the general risk management (RM) processes implied by IEC 80001-1. Each process of this PRM is described in terms of a purpose and outcomes. The PRM does not attempt to place the processes in any specific environment nor does it pre-determine any level of process capability required to fulfil the IEC 80001-1 requirements. The PRM is not intended to be used for a conformity assessment audit or process implementation reference guide. Any organization can define processes for its specific environment and circumstances for a PRM. The purposes and outcomes of each process described in this technical report are, however, considered to be the minimum necessary to meet IEC 80001-1 requirements in relation to each process. The 14 processes in the PRM have been identified in order to give coverage to all the requirements of IEC 80001-1. The PRM does not provide the evidence required by ISO/IEC 80001-1. The PRM does not specify the interfaces between the processes. Clause B.2 of this Annex provides an overview of the PRM. Clause B.3 provides a description of the risk management processes for IT networks incorporating medical devices. Clause B.4 provides a statement of conformity for this PRM in accordance with ISO/IEC 15504-2. B.2 Overview of the Process Reference Model B.2.1 General This clause describes the structure of the PRM in the context of risk management of IT-Networks incorporating Medical Devices to address Safety, Effectiveness and Data & System Security. Figure B.1 identifies the processes derived from IEC 80001-1 requirements, which are included in this PRM for Application of Risk Management for IT-Networks Incorporating Medical Devices.

It enables implemented processes of IEC 80001-1 to be assessed according to the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2. The PRM defined in Annex B of this technical report, associated with the process attributes defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2, establish a PAM used as a common basis for performing assessments of process capability, allowing for the reporting of results using a common rating scale. An integral part of conducting an assessment is to use a PAM that is constructed for that purpose, is related to a PRM and is conformant with ISO/IEC 15504-2. ISO/IEC 15504-2 sets out the minimum requirements for performing an assessment in order to ensure consistency and repeatability of the ratings. ISO/IEC 15504-2 addresses the assessment of process and the application of process assessment for improvement and capability determination. Results of conformant process assessments may be compared when the scope of the assessments are considered to be similar.  The IEC 80001-1 PRM in Annex B of this technical report has been used as the basis for the PAM. The relationship between IEC 80001-1, IEC 80001-1 (PRM), IEC 80001-1 (PAM) and ISO/IEC 15504-2 is shown in Figure C.1.

It provides greater detail to indicate process performance and capability. The indicators may also be used when implementing a process improvement program or to help evaluate and select an assessment model, method, methodology or tools. This PAM embodies the core characteristics that could be expected of any PAM consistent with ISO/IEC 15504-2. Nevertheless any other PAMs meeting the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2 may be used in a conformant assessment. C.2 Overview of the exemplar Process Assessment Model C.2.1 Introduction to Overview This annex provides an exemplar PAM that includes examples of assessment indicators. The PRM defined in Annex B, associated with the process attributes defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2, establish a PAM used as a common basis for performing assessments of risk management for networks incorporating medical devices process capability, allowing for the reporting of results using a common rating scale. The PAM is a two-dimensional model of process capability. In one dimension, the process dimension, the processes are defined. In the other dimension, the capability dimension, a set of process attributes grouped into capability levels is defined. The process attributes provide the measurable characteristics of process capability. Figure C.2 shows the relationship between the general structure of the PAM, ISO/IEC 15504-2 and IEC 80001-1. Figure C.2 — Relationship between the Process Assessment Model and its inputs A PRM and a capability dimension defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 cannot be used alone as the basis for conducting reliable and consistent assessments of process capability since the level of detail provided is not sufficient. The descriptions of process purpose and outcomes in a PRM, and the process attribute definitions in ISO/IEC 15504-2, need to be supported with a comprehensive set of indicators of process performance and process capability that are used for assessment performance. The assessment indicators are described in subclause C.3.

C.2.2 Structure of the exemplar Process Assessment Model NOTE This subclause describes the detailed structure of the PAM and its key components.

Each process in the PAM is described in terms of a purpose statement. These statements contain the unique functional objectives of the process when performed in a particular environment. A list of specific outcomes is associated with each of the process purpose statements, as a list of expected positive results of the performance of the processes. Satisfying the purpose statements of a process represents the first step in building a level 1 process capability where the expected outcomes are observable. The processes are described in subclauses C.5.2 to C.5.15. C.2.2.3 Capability dimension For the capability dimension, the process capability levels and process attributes are identical to those defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2.  Evolving process capability is expressed in the PAM in terms of process attributes grouped into capability levels. Process attributes are features of a process that can be evaluated on a scale of achievement, providing a measure of the capability of the process. They are applicable to all processes. Each process attribute describes a facet of the overall capability of managing and improving the effectiveness of a process in achieving its purpose and contributing to the business goals of the organization. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/201656 © 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 A capability level is a set of process attribute(s) that work together to provide a major enhancement in the capability to perform a process. The levels constitute a rational way of progressing through improvement of the capability of any process and are defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. There are six capability levels, incorporating nine process attributes. Level 0: Incomplete process The process is not implemented, or fails to achieve its process purpose. At this level, there is little or no evidence of any systematic achievement of the process purpose. Level 1: Performed process The implemented process achieves its process purpose. Level 2: Managed process The previously described Performed process is now implemented in a managed fashion (planned, monitored and adjusted) and its work products are appropriately established, controlled and maintained. Level 3: Established process The previously described Managed process is now implemented using a defined process that is capable of achieving its process outcomes. Level 4: Predictable process The previously described Established process now operates within defined limits to achieve its process outcomes. Level 5: Optimizing process The previously described Predictable process is continuously improved to meet relevant current and projected business goals. Within the PAM, the measure of capability is based upon the nine process attributes (PA) defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2.Process attributes are used to determine whether a process has reached a given capability. Each attributemeasures a particular aspect of the process capability. At each level there is no ordering between the process attributes; each attribute addresses a specific aspect of the capability level with each being of equal importance for the achievement of the relevant capability level. The list of process attributes is shown in Table C.1. Table C.1 — Capability levels and process attributes Process Attribute ID Capability Levels and Process Attributes Level 0: Incomplete process Level 1: Performed process PA 1.1 Process performance Level 2: Managed process PA 2.1 Performance management PA 2.2 Work Products management Level 3: Established process PA 3.1 Process definition PA 3.2 Process deployment Level 4: Predictable process PA 4.1 Process measurement PA 4.2 Process control Level 5: Optimizing process PA 5.1 Process innovation PA 5.2 Continuous optimization The process attributes are evaluated on a four point ordinal scale of achievement, as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 and used in the exemplar assessment method. They provide insight into the specific aspects of process capability required to support process improvement and capability determination. C.3 Assessment Indicators C.3.1 Overview The PAM is based on the principle that the capability of a process can be assessed by demonstrating the achievement of process attributes on the basis of evidence related to assessment indicators. AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/2016© 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 57 There are two types of assessment indicators: process capability indicators, which apply to capability levels 1 to 5 and process performance indicators, which apply exclusively to capability level 1. These indicators are defined in subclauses C.3.2 and C.3.3. The process attributes in the capability dimension have a set of process capability indicators that provide an indication of the extent of achievement of the attribute in the instantiated process. These indicators concern significant activities, resources or results associated with the achievement of the attribute purpose by a process. The process capability indicators are:  Generic Practice (GP);  Generic Resource (GR);  Generic Work Product (GWP). As additional indicators for supporting the assessment of a process at Level 1, each process in the process dimension has a set of process performance indicators which is used to measure the degree of achievement of the process performance attribute for the process assessed. The process performance indicators are:  Base Practice (BP);  Work Product (WP). The performance of Base Practices (BPs) provides an indication of the extent of achievement of the process purpose and process outcomes. Work Products (WPs) are either used or produced (or both), when performing the process. The process performance and process capability indicators defined in the PAM represent types of objective evidence that might be found in an instantiation of a process and therefore could be used to judge achievement of capability. Figure C.4 shows how the assessment indicators are related to process performance and process capability. Figure C.4 — Assessment Indicators AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/201658 © 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 C.3.2  Process Capability Indicators The three types of process capability indicators related to levels 1 to 5 are identified in Figure C.5. They are intended to be applicable to all processes. Figure C.5 — Process capability indicators All the process capability indicators relate to the process attributes defined in the capability dimension of the PAM. They represent the type of evidence that would support judgments of the extent to which the attributes are achieved. Evidence of their effective performance or existence supports the judgment of the degree of achievement of the attribute. The generic practices are the principal indicators of process capability. The Generic Practice (GP) indicators are indicators of activities of a generic type and provide guidance on the implementation of the attribute's characteristics. They support the achievement of the process attribute and many of them concern management practices, i.e. practices that are established to support the process performance as it is characterized at level 1. During the evaluation of process capability, the primary focus is on the performance of the generic practices. In general, performance of all generic practices is expected for full achievement of the process attribute. The Generic Resource (GR) indicators are associated resources that may be used when performing the process in order to achieve the attribute. These resources may include human resources, tools, methods and infrastructure. The availability of a resource indicates the potential to fulfil the purpose of a specific attribute. NOTE: The assessor should interpret the generic resources according to the process assessed; e.g. for PA2.1 resources (with identified objectives, responsibilities and authorities), an assessor would look for roles (with identified objectives, responsibilities and authorities) in primary and supporting processes, but for organizational processes would look for governance structures (e.g. mandated committees, positions) with identified objectives, responsibilities and authorities. The Generic Work Product (GWP) indicators are sets of characteristics that would be expected to be evident in work products of generic types as a result of achievement of an attribute. The generic work products form the basis for the classification of the work products defined as process performance indicators; they represent basic types of work products from all types of processes. These three types of indicators help to establish objective evidence of the extent of achievement of the specified process attribute. Capability level 1-5 Process attribute achievement Process Attribute Generic Resources Generic Practice Generic Practice Generic Practice Generic Work Products AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/2016© 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 59 Due to the fact that Level 1 capability of a process is only characterized by the measure of the extent to which the process purpose is achieved, the process performance attribute (PA.1.1) has a single generic practice indicator (GP.1.1.1). In order to support the assessment of PA.1.1 and to amplify the process performance achievement analysis, additional process performance indicators are defined in the PAM. C.3.3 Process Performance Indicators There are two types of process performance indicators: Base Practice (BP) indicators and Work Product (WP) indicators. Process performance indicators relate to individual processes defined in the process dimension of the PAM and are chosen to explicitly address the achievement of the defined process outcomes. Evidence of performance of the base practices, and the presence of work products with their expected characteristics, provide objective evidence of the achievement of the process outcomes. A base practice is an activity that addresses the purpose of a particular process. Consistently performing the base practices associated with a process helps the consistent achievement of its purpose. A coherent set of base practices is associated with each process in the process dimension. The base practices are described at an abstract level, identifying "what" should be done without specifying "how". Implementing the base practices of a process should achieve the basic outcomes that reflect the process purpose. Base practices represent only the first step in building process capability, but the base practices represent the unique, functional activities of the process, even if that performance is not systematic. The performance of a process produces work products that are identifiable and usable in achieving the purpose of the process. In this assessment model, each work product has a defined set of example work product characteristics that may be used when reviewing the work product to assess the effective performance of a process. Work product characteristics may be used to identify the corresponding work product produced/used by the assessed organization. Subclauses C.5.2 to C.5.15 extend the description of the processes contained within the PRM with the inclusion of base practices and the associated work products. Table C.4 contains a list of generic and specific work products together with the work product characteristics. C.4 Measuring process capability The process performance and process capability indicators in this model give examples of evidence that an assessor might obtain, or observe, in the performance of an assessment. The evidence obtained in the assessment, through observation of the implemented process, can be mapped onto the set of indicators to enable correlation between the implemented process and the processes defined in this assessment model. These indicators provide guidance for assessors in accumulating the necessary objective evidence to support judgments of capability. They are not intended to be regarded as a mandatory set of checklists to be followed. An indicator is defined as an objective characteristic of a practice or work product that supports the judgment of the performance or capability of an implemented process. The assessment indicators, and their relationship to process performance and process capability, are shown in Figure C.6. Assessment indicators are used to confirm that certain practices were performed, as shown by observable evidence collected during an assessment. All such evidence comes either from the examination of work products of the processes assessed, or from statements made by the performers and managers of the processes. The existence of base practices, work products, and work product characteristics, provide evidence of the performance of the processes associated with them. Similarly, the existence of process capability indicators provides evidence of process capability. The evidence obtained should be recorded in a form that clearly relates to an associated indicator, so that the support for the assessor’s judgment can be readily confirmed or verified as required by ISO/IEC 15504-2. The output from a process assessment is a set of process profiles, one for each process within the scope of the assessment. A typical process profile is illustrated in ISO/IEC 15504-4. Each process profile consists of a set of the process attribute ratings for an assessed process. Each attribute rating represents a judgment by the assessor of the extent to which the attribute is achieved. To improve the reliability and repeatability of the assessment, the judgments of the assessor are based on a coherent set of recorded objective evidences.AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/15/201660 © 2015 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI/ISO TIR80001-2-7:2014 Figure C.6 — Relationship between assessment indicators and process capability C.5 The process dimension and process performance indicators (Level 1) C.5.1 General This subclause defines the processes and the process performance indicators, also known as the process dimension, of the PAM. The processes in the process dimension can be directly mapped to the processes defined in the PRM. The process purposes, outcomes, the practices, the inputs and outputs of processes are included in this subclause. The individual processes are described in terms of process name, process purpose, and process outcomes as defined in IEC 80001-1 (PRM): In addition, the process dimension of the PAM provides information in the form of:  a set of base practices for the process needed to accomplish the process outcomes; a single base practice is explicitly associated with one or more process outcome;  a number of inputs/outputs associated with each process and their relationship to one or more of its outcomes by numbers in square brackets, (i.e. [n]);  characteristics associated with each input/output. The Work product identifiers and characteristics are contained in Table C.4. The process purposes, outcomes, the base practices and the work products associated with the processes are included in this clause. The work product characteristics are contained in clause C.8 of this Annex. The base practices and work products constitute the set of indicators of process performance. The associated work products listed in this clause may be used when reviewing potential inputs and outputs of an organization's process implementation. The associated work products provide objective guidance for potential inputs and outputs to look for, and objective evidence supporting the assessment of a particular process. A documented assessment process and assessor judgment is needed to ensure that process context (application domain, business purpose, development methodology, size of the organization, etc.) is explicitly considered when using this information. This list should not be considered as a checklist of what each organization must have but rather as an example and starting point for considering whether, given the context, the work products are necessary and contributing to the intended purpose of the process.

C.7 Conformity of the exemplar Process Assessment Model C.7.1 General Annex C sets out a PAM that meets the requirements for conformance defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. This PAM can be used in the performance of assessments that meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504. It may also be used as an example for a PAM developer. This clause serves as the statement of conformance of the PAM to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. For ease of reference, the requirements from Clause 6.3 of ISO/IEC 15504-2 are embedded verbatim in the text of this Clause. They should not be construed as normative elements of this technical report. Since this PAM has been explicitly constructed to be an elaboration of the PRM defined in IEC 80001-1, the conformance claim is relatively simple. For other models, particularly ones with a different architecture, the demonstration of conformance may be more difficult requiring more detail in the mapping. Requirements for PAMs (from ISO/IEC 15504-2) C.7.2 Introduction In order to assure that assessment results are translatable into an ISO/IEC 15504 process profile in a repeatable and reliable manner, PAMs shall adhere to certain requirements. A PAM shall contain a definition of its purpose, scope and elements; its mapping to the Measurement Framework and specified PRM(s); and a mechanism for consistent expression of results. A PAM is considered suitable for the purpose of assessing process capability by conforming to 6.3.2, 6.3.3, and 6.3.4. [ISO/IEC 15504-2, 6.3.1] The purpose of this PAM is to support assessment of process capability in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2 (Refer Clause 1).

NOTE: It would be permissible for a model, for example, to address solely level 1, or to address levels 1, 2 and 3, but it would not be permissible to address levels 2 and 3 without level 1. 6.3.2.3 A PAM shall declare its scope of coverage in the terms of: a)the selected PRM(s);b)the selected processes taken from the PRM(s);c)the capability levels selected from the Measurement Framework.[ISO/IEC 15504-2, 6.3.2] This PAM is based upon the PRM defined in IEC 80001-1(PRM). In the capability dimension of this PAM, the model addresses all of the capability levels defined in the Measurement Framework in ISO/IEC 15504-2, Clause 5. C.7.4 Process Assessment Model elements and indicators A PAM shall be based on a set of indicators that explicitly addresses the purposes and outcomes, as defined in the selected PRM, of all the processes within the scope of the PAM; and that demonstrates the achievement of the process attributes within the capability level scope of the PAM. The indicators focus attention on the implementation of the processes in the scope of the model. [ISO/IEC 15504-2, 6.3.3] The PAM provides a two-dimensional view of process capability for the processes in the PRM, through the inclusion of assessment indicators as shown in Figure 5. The Assessment Indicators used are:  base practices and inputs/outputs; and  generic practices, generic resources and generic inputs/outputs as shown in Figure 5. They support the judgment of the performance and capability of an implemented process. C.7.5 Mapping Process Assessment Models to Process Reference Models A PAM shall provide an explicit mapping from the relevant elements of the model to the processes of the selected PRM and to the relevant process attributes of the Measurement Framework. The mapping shall be complete, clear and unambiguous. The mapping of the indicators within the PAM shall be to: a)the purposes and outcomes of the processes in the specified PRM;b)the process attributes (including all of the results of achievements listed for each process attribute) in theMeasurement Framework. This enables PAMs that are structurally different to be related to the same PRM.

NOTE: The expression of results may involve a direct translation of PAM ratings into a process profile as defined in this international standard, or the conversion of the data collected during the assessment (with the possible inclusion of additional information) through further judgment on the part of the assessor. [ISO/IEC 15504-2, 6.3.5] The processes in this PAM are identical to those defined in the PRM. The Process Attributes and the Process Attributes Rating in this PAM are identical to those defined in the Measurement Framework. As a consequence, results of Assessments based upon this PAM are expressed directly as a set of process attribute ratings for each process within the scope of the assessment. No form of translation or conversion is required. C.8 Work Product characteristics C.8.1 General Characteristics of work products listed in this Clause can be used when reviewing potential inputs and outputs of process implementation. The characteristics are provided as guidance for the attributes to look for to provide objective evidence supporting the assessment of a particular process. A documented process and assessor judgment is needed to ensure that the process context (application domain, business purpose, development methodology, size of the organization, etc.) is considered when using this information. Work products are defined using the schema in Table C.3 Work products and their characteristics should be considered as a starting point for considering whether, given the context, they are contributing to the intended purpose of the process.

Work Product name Provides an example of a typical name associated with the input/output characteristics. This name is provided as an identifier of the type of input/output the practice or process might produce. Organizations may call these input/outputs by different names. The name of the input/output in the organization is not significant. Similarly, organizations may have several equivalent input/outputs which contain the characteristics defined in one input/output type. The formats for the input/outputs can vary. It is up to the assessor and the organizational unit coordinator to map the actual input/outputs produced in their organization to the examples given here. Work Product characteristics Provides examples of the potential characteristics associated with the input/output types. The assessor may look for these in the samples provided by the organizational unit. C.8.2 Generic Work Products The Generic Work Product Indicators are sets of characteristics that would be expected to be evident in work products of a generic type as a result of achievement of an attribute. The generic work products form the basis for the classification of the work products defined as process performance indicators. These work product types are basic input types to process owners of all types of processes. C.8.3 Specific inputs and outputs Specific outputs are typically created by process owners and applied by process deployers in order to satisfy an outcome of a particular process purpose. Table C.4 shows a list of generic outputs (ending 00 e.g. 01-00 Configuration Item) and specific outputs (not ending 00 e.g. 02-01 Responsibility Agreements).

NOTE In order to support incorporating medical devices into an IT network, the medical device manufacturers make available technical information appropriate to the creation of RO Risk Management documentation. Where the process requires information that a medical device manufacturer believes is sensitive in nature, the provision of the information is determined by the RA and can be protected by a confidentiality agreement.

LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES   FOREWORD 1) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. DISCLAIMER This Consolidated version is not an official IEC Standard and has been prepared for user convenience. Only the current versions of the standard and its amendment(s) are to be considered the official documents. This Consolidated version of IEC 62304 bears the edition number 1.1. It consists of the first edition (2006-05) [documents 62A/523/FDIS and 62A/528/RVD] and its amendment 1 (2015-06) [documents 62A/1007/FDIS and 62A/1014/RVD]. The technical content is identical to the base edition and its amendment. In this Redline version, a vertical line in the margin shows where the technical content is modified by amendment 1. Additions and deletions are displayed in red, with deletions being struck through. A separate Final version with all changes accepted is available in this publication. International Standard IEC 62304 has been prepared by a joint working group of subcommittee 62A: Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, of IEC technical Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 5 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  committee 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice and ISO Technical Committee 210, Quality management and corresponding general aspects for MEDICAL DEVICES. Table C.5 was prepared by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, Software and system engineering. It is published as a dual logo standard. This publication has been drafted in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. In this standard the following print types are used: • requirements and definitions: in roman type; • informative material appearing outside of tables, such as notes, examples and references: in smaller type. Normative text of tables is also in a smaller type; • terms used throughout this standard that have been defined in Clause 3 and also given in the index: in small capitals. An asterisk (*) as the first character of a title or at the beginning of a paragraph indicates that there is guidance related to that item in Annex B. The committee has decided that the contents of the base publication and its amendment will remain unchanged until the stability date indicated on the IEC web site under "http://webstore.iec.ch" in the data related to the specific publication. At this date, the publication will be  • reconfirmed, • withdrawn, • replaced by a revised edition, or • amended.  NOTE The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment MANUFACTURERS and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC or ISO publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for mandatory implementation nationally not earlier than 3 years from the date of publication.  IMPORTANT – The 'colour inside' logo on the cover page of this publication indicates that it contains colours which are considered to be useful for the correct understanding of its contents. Users should therefore print this document using a colour printer.

Establishing the SAFETY and effectiveness of a MEDICAL DEVICE containing software requires knowledge of what the software is intended to do and demonstration that the use of the software fulfils those intentions without causing any unacceptable RISKS.  This standard provides a framework of life cycle PROCESSES with ACTIVITIES and TASKS necessary for the safe design and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This standard provides requirements for each life cycle PROCESS. Each life cycle PROCESS is further divided into consists of a set of ACTIVITIES, with most ACTIVITIES further divided into consisting of a set of TASKS. As a basic foundation it is assumed that MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is developed and maintained within a quality management system (see 4.1) and a RISK MANAGEMENT system (see 4.2). The RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS is already very well addressed by the International Standard ISO 14971. Therefore IEC 62304 makes use of this advantage simply by a normative reference to ISO 14971. Some minor additional RISK MANAGEMENT requirements are needed for software, especially in the area of identification of contributing software factors related to HAZARDS. These requirements are summarized and captured in Clause 7 as the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. Whether software is a contributing factor to a HAZARD HAZARDOUS SITUATION is determined during the HAZARD identification ACTIVITY of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. HAZARDS HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that could be indirectly caused by software (for example, by providing misleading information that could cause inappropriate treatment to be administered) need to be considered when determining whether software is a contributing factor. The decision to use software to control RISK is made during the RISK CONTROL ACTIVITY of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS required in this standard has to be embedded in the device RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS according to ISO 14971. The software development PROCESS consists of a number of ACTIVITIES. These ACTIVITIES are shown in Figure 1 and described in Clause 5. Because many incidents in the field are related to service or maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEMS including inappropriate software updates and upgrades, the software maintenance PROCESS is considered to be as important as the software development PROCESS. The software maintenance PROCESS is very similar to the software development PROCESS. It is shown in Figure 2 and described in Clause 6.

This standard does not specify an organizational structure for the MANUFACTURER or which part of the organization is to perform which PROCESS, ACTIVITY, or TASK. This standard requires only that the PROCESS, ACTIVITY, or TASK be completed to establish compliance with this standard. This standard does not prescribe the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation to be produced. This standard requires documentation of TASKS, but the decision of how to package this documentation is left to the user of the standard. This standard does not prescribe a specific life cycle model. The users of this standard are responsible for selecting a life cycle model for the software project and for mapping the PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS in this standard onto that model. Annex A provides rationale for the clauses of this standard. Annex B provides guidance on the provisions of this standard. For the purposes of this standard: • “shall” means that compliance with a requirement is mandatory for compliance with this standard; • “should” means that compliance with a requirement is recommended but is not mandatory for compliance with this standard; • “may” is used to describe a permissible way to achieve compliance with a requirement; • “establish” means to define, document, and implement; and • where this standard uses the term “as appropriate” in conjunction with a required PROCESS, ACTIVITY, TASK or output, the intention is that the MANUFACTURER shall use the PROCESS, ACTIVITY, TASK or output unless the MANUFACTURER can document a justification for not so doing.  INTRODUCTION to Amendment 1 The first edition of IEC 62304 was published in 2006. This amendment is intended to add requirements to deal with LEGACY SOFTWARE, where the software design is prior to the existence of the current version, to assist manufacturers who must show compliance to the standard to meet European Directives. Software safety classification changes needed for this amendment include clarification of requirements and updating of the software safety classification to include a risk-based approach.  Work is continuing in parallel to develop the second edition of IEC 62304.

The set of PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS described in this standard establishes a common framework for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE life cycle PROCESSES. 1.2 * Field of application This standard applies to the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This standard applies to the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE when software is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE or when software is an embedded or integral part of the final MEDICAL DEVICE. NOTE 1 This standard can be used in the development and maintenance of software that is itself a medical device.  However, additional development activities are needed at the system level before this type of software can be placed into service.  These system activities are not covered by this standard, but can be found in IEC 82304-11 [22]. This standard describes PROCESSES that are intended to be applied to software which executes on a processor or which is executed by other software (for example an interpreter) which executes on a processor. This standard applies regardless of the persistent storage device(s) used to store the software (for example: hard disk, optical disk, permanent or flash memory). This standard applies regardless of the method of delivery of the software (for example: transmission by network or email, optical disk, flash memory or EEPROM). The method of software delivery itself is not considered MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This standard does not cover validation and final release of the MEDICAL DEVICE, even when the MEDICAL DEVICE consists entirely of software. NOTE 2 If a medical device incorporates embedded software intended to be executed on a processor, the requirements of this standard apply to the software, including the requirements concerning software of unknown provenance (see 8.1.2). NOTE 3 Validation and other development activities are needed at the system level before the software and medical device can be placed into service.  These system activities are not covered by this standard, but can be found in related product standards (e.g., IEC 60601-1, IEC 82304-1, etc.).  1.3 Relationship to other standards This MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE life cycle standard is to be used together with other appropriate standards when developing a MEDICAL DEVICE. Annex C shows the relationship between this standard and other relevant standards. 1.4 Compliance Compliance with this standard is defined as implementing all of the PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS identified in this standard in accordance with the software safety class. ___________ 1  In preparation.

Compliance is determined by inspection of all documentation required by this standard including the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE, and assessment of the PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES and TASKS required for the software safety class. See Annex D. NOTE 1 This assessment could be carried out by internal or external audit. NOTE 2 Although the specified PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS are performed, flexibility exists in the methods of implementing these PROCESSES and performing these ACTIVITIES and TASKS. NOTE 3 Where any requirements contain “as appropriate” and were not performed, documentation for the justification is necessary for this assessment. NOTE 4 The term “conformance” is used in ISO/IEC 12207 where the term “compliance” is used in this standard. NOTE 5 For compliance of LEGACY SOFTWARE see 4.4. 2 * Normative references The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

Figure 3 – Assigning software safety classification The software safety classes shall initially be assigned based on severity as follows: Class A: No injury or damage to health is possible Class B: Non-SERIOUS INJURY is possible Class C: Death or SERIOUS INJURY is possible If the HAZARD could arise from a failure of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM to behave as specified, the probability of such failure shall be assumed to be 100 percent. If the RISK of death or SERIOUS INJURY arising from a software failure is subsequently reduced to an acceptable level (as defined by ISO 14971) by a hardware RISK CONTROL measure, either by reducing the consequences of the failure or by reducing the probability of death or SERIOUS INJURY arising from that failure, the software safety classification may be reduced from C to B; and if the RISK of non-SERIOUS INJURY arising from a software failure is similarly reduced to an acceptable level by a hardware RISK CONTROL measure, the software safety classification may be reduced from B to A.

The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class B if: – the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is non-SERIOUS INJURY. The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class C if: – the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is death or SERIOUS INJURY. For a SOFTWARE SYSTEM initially classified as software safety class B or C, the MANUFACTURER may implement additional RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM (including revising the system architecture containing the SOFTWARE SYSTEM) and subsequently assign a new software safety classification to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM. NOTE 1 External RISK CONTROL measures can be hardware, an independent SOFTWARE SYSTEM, health care procedures, or other means to minimize that software can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. NOTE 2 See ISO 14971:2007 subclause 3.2, Management Responsibilities, for the definition of risk acceptability. b) The MANUFACTURER shall assign to each SOFTWARE SYSTEM that contributes to the implementation of a RISK CONTROL measure a software safety class based on the possible effects of the HAZARD that the RISK CONTROL measure is controlling.   Not used. c) The MANUFACTURER shall document the software safety class assigned to each SOFTWARE SYSTEM in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. d) When a SOFTWARE SYSTEM is decomposed into SOFTWARE ITEMS, and when a SOFTWARE ITEM is decomposed into further SOFTWARE ITEMS, such SOFTWARE ITEMS shall inherit the software safety classification of the original SOFTWARE ITEM (or SOFTWARE SYSTEM) unless the MANUFACTURER documents a rationale for classification into a different software safety class (software safety classes assigned according to 4.3 a) replacing “SOFTWARE SYSTEM” with “SOFTWARE ITEM”). Such a rationale shall explain how the new SOFTWARE ITEMS are segregated so that they may be classified separately. e) The MANUFACTURER shall document the software safety class of each SOFTWARE ITEM if that class is different from the class of the SOFTWARE ITEM from which it was created by decomposition. f) For compliance with this standard, wherever a PROCESS is required for SOFTWARE ITEMS of a specific classification and the PROCESS is necessarily applied when applying this standard to a group of SOFTWARE ITEMS, the MANUFACTURER shall use the PROCESSES and TASKS which are required by the classification of the highest-classified SOFTWARE ITEM in the group unless the MANUFACTURER documents in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE a rationale for using a lower classification. g) For each SOFTWARE SYSTEM, until a software safety class is assigned, Class C requirements shall apply. NOTE In the requirements clauses and subclauses that follow, the software safety classes that the requirement must be performed for which a specific requirement applies are identified following the requirement in the form [Class . . .].

The minimum DELIVERABLE shall be SOFTWARE SYSTEM test records (see 5.7.5). NOTE Such gap analysis should assure that RISK CONTROL measures, implemented in LEGACY SOFTWARE, are included in the software requirements. 4.4.4 Gap closure activities a) The MANUFACTURER shall establish and execute a plan to generate the identified DELIVERABLES. Where available, objective evidence may be used to generate required DELIVERABLES without performing ACTIVITIES required by 5.2, 5.3, 5.7 and Clause 7.

A.1 Rationale The primary requirement of this standard is that a set of PROCESSES be followed in the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, and that the choice of PROCESSES be appropriate to the RISKS to the patient and other people. This follows from the belief that testing of software is not sufficient to determine that it is safe in operation. The PROCESSES required by this standard fall into two categories: – PROCESSES which are required to determine the RISKS arising from the operation of each SOFTWARE ITEM in the software; – PROCESSES which are required to achieve an appropriately low probability of software failure for each SOFTWARE ITEM, chosen on the basis of these determined RISKS. This standard requires the first category to be performed for all MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE and the second category to be performed for selected SOFTWARE ITEMS. A claim of compliance with this standard should therefore include a documented RISK ANALYSIS that identifies foreseeable sequences of events that include software and that can result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (see ISO 14971). HAZARDS HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that can be indirectly caused by software (for example, by providing misleading information that could cause inappropriate treatment to be administered) should be included in this RISK ANALYSIS. All ACTIVITIES that are required as part of the first category of PROCESSES are identified in the normative text as "[Class A, B, C]", indicating that they are required irrespective of the classification of the software to which they apply. ACTIVITIES are required for all classes A, B, and C for the following reasons: – the ACTIVITY produces a plan relevant to RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY produces an output that is an input to RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY is a part of RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY establishes an administration system, documentation or record-keeping system that supports RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY normally takes place when the classification of the related software is unknown; – the ACTIVITY can cause a change that could invalidate the current software safety classification of the associated software. This includes the discovery and analysis of safety related problems after release. Other PROCESSES are required only for SOFTWARE SYSTEMS or SOFTWARE ITEMS classified in software safety classes B or C. ACTIVITIES required as parts of these PROCESSES are identified in the normative text as "[Class B, C]", or "[Class C]" indicating that they are required selectively depending on the classification of the software to which they apply.

ACTIVITIES are required selectively for software in class C for the following reasons: – the ACTIVITY further enhances the reliability of the software by requiring more detail, or more rigour, or attention to specific issues in the design, testing or other VERIFICATION Note that all PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES defined in this standard are considered valuable in assuring the development and maintenance of high quality software. The omission of many of these PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES as requirements for software in class A that cannot by definition cause a HAZARD should not imply that these PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES would not be of value or are not recommended. Their omission is intended to recognize that software that cannot cause a HAZARD can be easily assured of SAFETY and effectiveness primarily through overall validation ACTIVITY during the design of a MEDICAL DEVICE (which is outside the scope of this standard) and through some simple software life cycle controls.

To accomplish this, the standard identifies the minimum ACTIVITIES and TASKS that need to be accomplished to provide confidence that the software has been developed in a manner that is likely to produce highly reliable and safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. This annex provides guidance for the application of the requirements of this standard.  It does not add to, or otherwise change, the requirements of this standard. This annex can be used to better understand the requirements of this standard. Note that in this standard, ACTIVITIES are subclauses called out within the PROCESSES and TASKS are defined within the ACTIVITIES. For example, the ACTIVITIES defined for the software development PROCESS are software development planning, software requirements analysis, software ARCHITECTURAL design, software detailed design, SOFTWARE UNIT implementation and VERIFICATION, software integration and integration testing, SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing, and software release. The TASKS within these ACTIVITIES are the individual requirements. This standard does not require a particular SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL. However, compliance with this standard does imply dependencies between PROCESSES, because inputs of a PROCESS are generated by another PROCESS. For example, the software safety classification of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM should be completed after the RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS has established what HARM could arise from failure of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM. Because of such logical dependencies between processes, it is easiest to describe the processes in this standard in a sequence, implying a “waterfall” or “once-through” life cycle model. However, other life cycles can also be used. Some development (model) strategies as defined at ISO/IEC 12207 [9] include (see also Table B.1): – Waterfall. The “once-through" strategy, also called “waterfall”, consists of performing the development PROCESS a single time. Simplistically: determine customer needs, define requirements, design the SYSTEM, implement the system, test, fix and deliver. – Incremental: The “incremental” strategy determines customer needs and defines the SYSTEM requirements, then performs the rest of the development in a sequence of builds. The first build incorporates part of the planned capabilities, the next build adds more capabilities, and so on, until the SYSTEM is complete. – Evolutionary: The “evolutionary” strategy also develops a SYSTEM in builds but differs from the incremental strategy in acknowledging that the user need is not fully understood and all requirements cannot be defined up front. In this strategy, customer needs and SYSTEM requirements are partially defined up front, then are refined in each succeeding build.

Multiple development cycles? Distribute interim software? Waterfall   (Once-through) yes no no Incremental (Preplanned product improvement) yes yes maybe Evolutionary no yes yes  Whichever life cycle is chosen it is necessary to maintain the logical dependencies between PROCESS outputs such as specifications, design documents and software. The waterfall life cycle model achieves this by delaying the start of a PROCESS until the inputs for that PROCESS are complete and approved. Other life cycles, particularly evolutionary life cycles, permit PROCESS outputs to be produced before all the inputs for that PROCESS are available. For example, a new SOFTWARE ITEM can be specified, classified, implemented and VERIFIED before the whole software ARCHITECTURE has been finalised. Such life cycles carry the RISK that a change or development in one PROCESS output will invalidate another PROCESS output. All life cycles therefore use a comprehensive configuration management system to ensure that all PROCESS outputs are brought to a consistent state and the dependencies maintained. The following principles are important regardless of the software development life cycle used: – All PROCESS outputs should be maintained in a consistent state; whenever any PROCESS output is created or changed, all related PROCESS outputs should be updated promptly to maintain their consistency with each other and to maintain all dependencies explicitly or implicitly required by this standard; – all PROCESS outputs should be available when needed as input to further work on the software.  – before any MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is released, all PROCESS outputs should be consistent with each other and all dependencies between PROCESS outputs explicitly or implicitly required by this standard should be observed. B.1.2 Field of application This standard applies to the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE as well as the development and maintenance of a MEDICAL DEVICE that includes SOUP. The use of this standard requires the MANUFACTURER to perform MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT that is compliant with ISO 14971. Therefore, when the MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE includes an acquired component (this could be a purchased component or a component of unknown provenance), such as a printer/plotter that includes SOUP, the acquired component becomes the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER and must be included in the RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL DEVICE. It is assumed that through proper performance of MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT, the MANUFACTURER would understand the component and recognize that it includes SOUP. The MANUFACTURER using this standard would invoke the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS as part of the overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. The maintenance of released MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE applies to the post-production experience with the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Software maintenance includes the combination of all technical and administrative means, including supervision actions, to act on problem reports to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function as well as modification requests related to released MEDICAL DEVICE Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 42 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  SOFTWARE PRODUCT(S). For example, this includes problem rectification, regulatory reporting, re-validation and preventive action. See ISO/IEC 14764 [10]. B.2 Normative references ISO/IEC 90003 [15] provides guidance for applying a quality management system to software development. This guidance is not required by this standard but is highly recommended. B.3 Terms and definitions Where possible, terms have been defined using definitions from international standards. This standard chose to use three terms to describe the decomposition of a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (top level). The SOFTWARE SYSTEM can be a subsystem of the MEDICAL DEVICE (see IEC 60601-1-4 [2]) or a MEDICAL DEVICE in its own right, which then becomes a software MEDICAL DEVICE. The lowest level that is not further decomposed for the purposes of testing or software configuration management is the SOFTWARE UNIT. All levels of composition, including the top and bottom levels, can be called SOFTWARE ITEMS. A SOFTWARE SYSTEM, then, is composed of one or more SOFTWARE ITEMS, and each SOFTWARE ITEM is composed of one or more SOFTWARE UNITS or decomposable SOFTWARE ITEMS. The responsibility is left to the MANUFACTURER to provide the definition and granularity of the SOFTWARE ITEMS and SOFTWARE UNITS. Leaving these terms vague allows one to apply them to the many different development methods and types of software used in MEDICAL DEVICES. B.4 General requirements There is no known method to guarantee 100 % SAFETY for any kind of software. There are three major principles which promote SAFETY for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE: – RISK MANAGEMENT; – quality management; – software engineering. For the development and maintenance of safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE it is necessary to establish RISK MANAGEMENT as an integral part of a quality management system as an overall framework for the application of appropriate software engineering methods and techniques. The combination of these three concepts allows a MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER to follow a clearly structured and consistently repeatable decision-making PROCESS to promote SAFETY for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. B.4.1 Quality management system A disciplined and effective set of software PROCESSES includes organizational PROCESSES such as management, infrastructure, improvement, and training. To avoid duplication and to focus this standard on software engineering, these PROCESSES have been omitted from this standard. These PROCESSES are covered by a quality management system. ISO 13485 [8] is an International Standard that is specifically intended for applying the concepts of quality management to MEDICAL DEVICES. Conformance to ISO 13485 quality management system requirements does not automatically constitute conformity with national or regional regulatory requirements. It is the MANUFACTURER’S responsibility to identify and establish compliance with relevant regulatory requirements.

Rather than trying to define an appropriate RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this software engineering standard, it is required that the MANUFACTURER apply a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS that is compliant with  ISO 14971, which deals explicitly with RISK MANAGEMENT for MEDICAL DEVICES. Specific software RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES resulting from HAZARDS HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that have software as a contributing cause are identified in a supporting PROCESS described in Clause 7. B.4.3 Software safety classification The RISK associated with software as a part of a MEDICAL DEVICE, as an accessory to a MEDICAL DEVICE, or as a MEDICAL DEVICE in its own right, is used as the input to a software safety classification scheme, which then determines the PROCESSES to be used during the development and maintenance of software. RISK is considered to be a combination of the severity of injury HARM and the probability of its occurrence. However, there is no consensus on how to determine the probability of occurrence of software failures using traditional statistical methods. In this standard, therefore, SOFTWARE SYSTEM classification is based on the severity of the HAZARD resulting from failure of the software, assuming that the failure will occur. SOFTWARE SYSTEMS that contribute to the implementation of RISK CONTROL measures are classified based on the severity of the HAZARD they are controlling. However, no consensus exists for a method of quantitatively estimating the probability of occurrence of a software failure. When software is present in a sequence or combination of events leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the probability of the software failure occurring cannot be considered in estimating the RISK for the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. In such cases, considering a worst case probability is appropriate, and the probability for the software failure occurring should be set to 1. When it is possible to estimate the probability for the remaining events in the sequence (as it may be if they are not software) that probability can be used for the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring (P1 in Figure B.2). In many cases however, it might not be possible to estimate the probability for the remaining events in the sequence, and the RISK should be EVALUATED on the basis of the nature of the HARM alone (the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring should be set to 1). RISK ESTIMATION in these cases should be focused on the SEVERITY of the HARM resulting from the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Subjective rankings of probability can also be assigned based on clinical knowledge to distinguish failures that a clinician would be likely to detect from those that would not be detected and would be more likely to cause HARM. Estimates of probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION leading to HARM (P2 in Figure B.2) generally require clinical knowledge to distinguish between HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS where clinical practice would be likely to prevent HARM, and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that would be more likely to cause HARM.

It is only possible to determine the RISK associated with failure of a SOFTWARE ITEM: – if a SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and a software ARCHITECTURE define the role of the SOFTWARE ITEM in terms of its purpose and its interfaces with other software and hardware items; – if changes to the SYSTEM are controlled; – after RISK ANALYSIS has been done on the ARCHITECTURE and RISK CONTROL measures specified. This standard requires the minimum number of ACTIVITIES that will achieve the above conditions for all classes of software. The end of the software ARCHITECTURE ACTIVITY is the earliest point in the development when the full set of SOFTWARE ITEMS is defined and the RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY has identified how the SOFTWARE ITEMS relate to SAFETY. This is therefore the earliest point at which SOFTWARE ITEMS can be classified definitively according to their SAFETY role. This point corresponds to the point where RISK CONTROL is begun in ISO 14971. Before this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS identifies ARCHITECTURAL RISK CONTROL measures, for example adding protective subsystems, or reducing the opportunities for software failures to cause HARM. After this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS uses PROCESSES aimed at reducing the probability of failure of SOFTWARE ITEMS. In other words, the classification of a SOFTWARE ITEM specifies PROCESS-based RISK CONTROL measures to be applied to that item.

The software safety classification scheme is not intended to align with the RISK classifications of ISO 14971. Whereas the ISO 14971 scheme classifies RISK according to their severity and likelihood, the software safety classification scheme classifies SOFTWARE SYSTEMS and SOFTWARE ITEMS according to the PROCESSES to be applied in their development and maintenance. As the design evolves, new RISKS might become evident. Therefore, RISK MANAGEMENT should be applied as an integral part of the development PROCESS. This permits the development of an ARCHITECTURAL design that identifies a complete set of SOFTWARE ITEMS, including those that are required to function correctly to assure safe operation and those that prevent faults from causing HARM. The software ARCHITECTURE should promote segregation of software items that are required for safe operation and should describe the methods used to ensure effective segregation of those SOFTWARE ITEMS. Segregation is not restricted to physical (processor or memory partition) separation but includes any mechanism that prevents one SOFTWARE ITEM from negatively affecting another. The adequacy of a segregation is determined based on the RISKS involved and the rationale which is required to be documented. As stated in B.3, this standard chooses to use three terms to describe the decomposition of a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (top level).  Figure B.1 illustrates the possible partitioning for SOFTWARE ITEMS within a SOFTWARE SYSTEM and how the software safety classes would be applied to the group of SOFTWARE ITEMS in the decomposition.

During software ARCHITECTURE design the MANUFACTURER has decided to partition the SYSTEM, as shown, with 3 SOFTWARE ITEMS – X, W and Z. The MANUFACTURER is able to segregate all SOFTWARE SYSTEM contributions to HAZARDS HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS which could result in death or SERIOUS INJURY to SOFTWARE ITEM Z and all remaining SOFTWARE SYSTEM contributions to HAZARDS HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS  which could result in a non-SERIOUS INJURY to SOFTWARE ITEM W. SOFTWARE ITEm W is classified as software safety class B and SOFTWARE ITEM Z is at software safety class C. SOFTWARE ITEM Y therefore must be classified as Class C, per 4.3 d). The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is also at a software safety class C per this requirement. SOFTWARE ITEM X has been classified at a software safety class of A. The MANUFACTURER is able to document a rationale for the segregation between SOFTWARE ITEMS X and Y, as well as SOFTWARE ITEMS W and Z, to assure the integrity of the segregation. If partitioning segregation is not possible between SOFTWARE ITEMS X and Y, then SOFTWARE ITEM X must be classified in software safety class C. B.4.4 LEGACY SOFTWARE Subclause 4.4 establishes a process for application of this standard to LEGACY SOFTWARE. Some geographies may require the MANUFACTURER to show conformity to the standard to obtain regulatory approval of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, even if that software was designed prior to the existence of the current version of the standard (LEGACY SOFTWARE).  In this case, the requirements in 4.4 provide a method for the the MANUFACTURER to demonstrate compliance of LEGACY SOFTWARE to the standard.  A MANUFACTURER may determine that retrospective documentation of an already finished development-lifecycle performed as an isolated activity does not result in the reduction of RISK associated with the use of the product. The process results in the identification of a subset of IEC   724/06 Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 47 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  ACTIVITIES defined in this standard which does result in reduction of RISK. Some additional goals implicit in the process are: – required ACTIVITIES and resulting documentation should rely on and make use of, wherever possible, existing documentation, and – a MANUFACTURER should utilize resources as effectively as possible to effect a reduction of RISK. In addition to a plan identifying the subset of ACTIVITIES to execute, the process also results in objective evidence supporting safe continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE and a summary rationale for this conclusion. The RISKS associated with the planned continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE depend on the context in which the LEGACY SOFTWARE will be used to create a SOFTWARE SYSTEM. The MANUFACTURER will document all identified MEDICAL DEVICE HAZARDS associated with the LEGACY SOFTWARE. Subclause 4.4 requires a comprehensive assessment of available post-production field data obtained for the LEGACY SOFTWARE during the time it has been in production and use. Typical sources of post-production data include: – adverse events attributable to the device, – feedback received from users of the device, and – ANOMALIES discovered by the MANUFACTURER. Though no consensus exists for a method of prospectively estimating quantitatively the probability of occurrence of a software failure, such information may be available for LEGACY SOFTWARE, based on the usage of such software and EVALUATION of post-production data. If it is possible in such cases to quantitatively estimate the probability of events in the sequence, a quantitative value may be used for expressing the probability of the entire sequence of events occurring. If such quantitative estimation is not possible, considering a worst case probability is appropriate, and the probability for the software failure occurring should be assumed to be 1. The MANUFACTURER determination of how the LEGACY SOFTWARE will be used in the overall MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE is input to the assessment of RISK. The RISKS to be considered vary accordingly. – When LEGACY SOFTWARE has been safely and reliably used and the MANUFACTURER wishes to continue use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the rationale for continued use rests primarily on the assessment of RISK based on post-production records. – When LEGACY SOFTWARE is reused to create a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM, the intended use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE might be different from its original intended use. In this case the RISK assessment must take into account the modified set of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS which can arise due to failures of the LEGACY SOFTWARE. – A reused LEGACY SOFTWARE may be used for similar intended use but integrated into a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM.  In this case the RISK assessment should take into account modification of architectural RISK CONTROL measures according to 5.3. When LEGACY SOFTWARE will be changed and used within a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM, the MANUFACTURER should consider how the existing records of safe and reliable operation may be invalidated by the changes. Changes to the LEGACY SOFTWARE should be performed according to Clauses 4 to 9 of this standard, including assessment of impact to RISK CONTROL measures according to 7.4. In the case of LEGACY SOFTWARE, existing RISK CONTROL measures may not be fully documented and special care should be taken to EVALUATE the potential impact of changes, utilizing available documented design records as well as expertise of individuals having knowledge of the system.  Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 48 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  According to 4.4, the MANUFACTURER performs a gap analysis in order to determine the available documentation including objective evidence of performed TASKS done during development of the LEGACY SOFTWARE and compared to 5.2, 5.3, 5.7, and Clause 7. Typical steps to accomplish this gap analysis include a) identification of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, including VERSION, revision and any other means, required for clear identification; b) EVALUATION of existing DELIVERABLES corresponding to the deliverables required by 5.2, 5.3, 5.7, and Clause 7; c) EVALUATION of available objective evidence, documenting the previously applied software development lifecycle model (as appropriate); d) EVALUATION of the adequacy of existing RISK MANAGEMENT documentation, taking ISO 14971 into account. Taking the performed gap analysis into account, the MANUFACTURER will EVALUATE the potential reduction in RISK resulting from the generation of the missing DELIVERABLES and associated ACTIVITIES, and create a plan to perform ACTIVITIES and generate DELIVERABLES to close these gaps. Reduction of RISK should balance the benefit of applying the software development process according to Clause 5 against the possibility that modification of the LEGACY SOFTWARE without full knowledge of its development history could introduce new defects that increase the risk. Some of the elements of Clause 5 may be assessed to have little to no reduction of RISK when done after the fact. For example, detailed design and unit verification reduce RISK primarily during the process of developing new software or refactoring existing software. If these objectives are not planned, performing the ACTIVITIES in isolation may create documentation but lead to no reduction in RISK.   At a minimum, the gap closure plan addresses missing SOFTWARE SYSTEM test records. If these do not exist or are not suitable to support a rationale to continue use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the gap closure plan should include creation of SOFTWARE SYSTEM requirements at a functional level according to 5.2 and tests according to 5.7. The documented rationale for continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE builds on the available objective evidence and analysis obtained in the course of assessing the RISK and creating a gap closure plan appropriate for the context of LEGACY SOFTARE reuse. The rationale makes a positive case for the safe and reliable performace of the LEGACY SOFTWARE in the planned reuse context, taking into account both the post-production records available for the LEGACY SOFTWARE and the RISK CONTROL MEASURES affected by filling process gaps. After LEGACY SOFTWARE has been re-used according to 4.4, those parts of the LEGACY SOFTWARE for which gaps in DELIVERABLES remain, continue to be LEGACY SOFTWARE and may be considered for further re-use again according to 4.4. When gaps in deliverables are closed by changing the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the changes should be performed according to Clauses 4 to 9 of this standard. B.5 Software development PROCESS B.5.1 Software development planning The objective of this ACTIVITY is to plan the software development TASKS to reduce RISKS caused by software, communicate procedures and goals to members of the development team, and ensure that SYSTEM quality requirements for the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE are met. The software development planning ACTIVITY can document TASKS in a single plan or in multiple plans. Some MANUFACTURERS might have established policies and procedures that apply to the Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 49 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  development of all their MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE.  In this case the plan can simply reference the existing policies and procedures. Some MANUFACTURERS might prepare a plan or set of plans specific to the development of each MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCT that spell out in detail specific ACTIVITIES and reference general procedures. Another possibility is that a plan or set of plans is tailored for the development of each MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The planning should be specified at the level of detail necessary to carry out the development PROCESS and should be proportional to the RISK. For example, SYSTEMS or items with higher RISK would be subject to a development PROCESS with more rigor and TASKS should be spelled out in greater detail. Planning is an iterative ACTIVITY that should be re-examined and updated as development progresses. The plan can evolve to incorporate more and better information as more is understood about the SYSTEM and the level of effort needed to develop the SYSTEM. For example, a SYSTEM’s initial software safety classification can change as a result of exercising the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and development of the software ARCHITECTURE. Or it might be decided that a SOUP be incorporated into the SYSTEM. It is important that the plan(s) be updated to reflect current knowledge of the SYSTEM and the level of rigor needed for the SYSTEM or items in the SYSTEM to enable proper control over the development PROCESS. B.5.2 Software requirements analysis This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to establish and verify the software requirements for the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Establishing verifiable requirements is essential for determining what is to be built, for determining that the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE exhibits acceptable behaviour, and for demonstrating that the completed MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is ready for use. To demonstrate that the requirements have been implemented as desired, each requirement should be stated in such a way that objective criteria can be established to determine whether it has been implemented correctly.  If the device RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS imposes requirements on the software to control identified RISKS, these requirements are to be identified in the software requirements in such a way as to make it possible to trace the RISK CONTROL measures to the software requirements.  All software requirements should be identified in such a way as to make it possible to demonstrate TRACEABILITY between the requirement and SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing. If regulatory approval in some countries requires conformance to specific regulations or international standards, this conformance requirement should be documented in the software requirements. Because the software requirements establish what is to be implemented in the software, an evaluation of the requirements is required before the requirements analysis ACTIVITY is complete. An area of frequent confusion is the distinction between customer needs, design inputs, software requirements, software functional specifications, and software design specifications. Design inputs are the interpretation of customer needs into formally documented MEDICAL DEVICE requirements. Software requirements are the formally documented specifications of what the software does to meet the customer needs and the design inputs. Software functional specifications are often included with the software requirements and define in detail what the software does to meet its requirements even though many different alternatives might also meet the requirements. Software design specifications define how the software will be designed and decomposed to implement its requirements and functional specifications. Traditionally, software requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications have been written as a set of one or more documents. It is now feasible to consider this information as data items within a common database. Each item would have one or more attributes that would define its purpose and linkage to other items in the database. This approach allows presentation and printing of different views of the information best suited for each set of intended users (e.g., marketing, MANUFACTURERS, testers, auditors) and supports TRACEABILITY to demonstrate adequate implementation and the extent to which test cases test the requirements. Tools to support this approach can be as simple as a hypertext document using HTML hyperlinks or as complex and capable as computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools and requirements analysis tools. The SYSTEM requirements PROCESS is out of scope of this standard. However, the decision to implement MEDICAL DEVICE functionality with software is normally made during SYSTEM design. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 50 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  Some or all of the SYSTEM requirements are allocated to be implemented in software. The software requirements analysis ACTIVITY consists of analyzing the requirements allocated to software by the SYSTEM requirements PROCESS and deriving a comprehensive set of software requirements that reflect the allocated requirements. To ensure the integrity of the SYSTEM, the MANUFACTURER should provide a mechanism for negotiating changes and clarifications to the SYSTEM requirements to correct impracticalities, inconsistencies or ambiguities in either the parent SYSTEM requirements or the software requirements. The PROCESS of capture and analysis of SYSTEM and software requirements can be iterative. This standard does not intend to require the PROCESSES to be rigidly segregated into two layers. In practice, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and software ARCHITECTURE are often outlined simultaneously and the SYSTEM and software requirements are subsequently documented in a layered form. B.5.3 Software ARCHITECTURAL design This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to define the major structural components of the software and identify their key responsibilities, their externally visible properties, and the relationship among them. If the behaviour of a component can affect other components, that behavior should be described in the software ARCHITECTURE. This description is especially important for behaviour that can affect components of the MEDICAL DEVICE that are outside the software (see 5.3.5 and B.4.3). ARCHITECTURAL decisions are extremely important for implementing RISK CONTROL measures. Without understanding (and documenting) the behaviour of a component that can affect other components, it will be nearly impossible to show that the SYSTEM is safe. A software ARCHITECTURE is necessary to ensure the correct implementation of the software requirements. The software ARCHITECTURE is not complete unless all software requirements can be implemented by the identified SOFTWARE ITEMS. Because the design and implementation of the software is dependent on the ARCHITECTURE, the ARCHITECTURE is VERIFIED to complete this ACTIVITY. VERIFICATION of the ARCHITECTURE is generally done by technical EVALUATION. The software safety classification of SOFTWARE ITEMS during the software ARCHITECTURE ACTIVITY creates a basis for the subsequent choice of software PROCESSES. The records of classification are placed under change control as part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Many subsequent events might invalidate the classification. These include, for example: – changes of SYSTEM specification, software specification or ARCHITECTURE; – discovery of errors in the RISK ANALYSIS, especially unforeseen HAZARDS; and – discovery of the infeasibility of a requirement, especially a RISK CONTROL measure; Therefore, during all ACTIVITIES following the design of the software ARCHITECTURE, the classification of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and SOFTWARE ITEMS should be re-EVALUATED and might need to be revised. This would trigger rework to apply additional PROCESSES to a SOFTWARE ITEM as a result of its upgrading to a higher class. The software configuration management PROCESS (Clause 8) is used to ensure that all necessary rework is identified and completed. B.5.4 Software detailed design This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to refine the SOFTWARE ITEMS and interfaces defined in the ARCHITECTURE to create SOFTWARE UNITS and their interfaces. Although SOFTWARE UNITS are often thought of as being a single function or module, this view is not always appropriate. We have This standard has defined SOFTWARE UNIT to be a SOFTWARE ITEM that is not subdivided into smaller items. SOFTWARE UNITS can be tested separately. The MANUFACTURER should define the level of detail of the SOFTWARE UNIT. Detailed design specifies algorithms, data representations, interfaces among different SOFTWARE UNITS, and interfaces between SOFTWARE UNITS and data structures. Detailed design must also be concerned with the packaging of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. It is necessary to document the design of each SOFTWARE UNIT and its interface so that the SOFTWARE UNIT can be implemented correctly.

It is necessary to define the design of the SOFTWARE UNITS and the interfaces in sufficient detail to permit its SAFETY and effectiveness to be objectively VERIFIED where this can be ensured using other requirements or design documentation. It should be complete enough that the programmer is not required to make ad hoc design decisions. Detailed design must also be concerned with the architecture of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. A SOFTWARE ITEM can be decomposed so that only a few of the new SOFTWARE ITEMS implement the SAFETY-related requirement of the original SOFTWARE ITEM. The remaining SOFTWARE ITEMS do not implement SAFETY-related functions and can be reclassified into a lower software safety class. However, the decision to do this is in itself part of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, and is documented in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Because implementation depends on detailed design, it is necessary to verify the detailed design before the ACTIVITY is complete. VERIFICATION of detailed design is generally done by a technical EVALUATION. Subclause 5.4.4 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the outputs of the detailed design ACTIVITIES. The design specifies how the requirements are to be implemented. VERIFICATION of the design provides assurance that it implements the software ARCHITECTURE and is free from contradiction with the software ARCHITECTURE. If the design contains defects, the code will not implement the requirements correctly. When present in the design, the MANUFACTURER should verify design characteristics which the MANUFACTURER believes are important for SAFETY. Examples of these characteristics include: – implementation of the intended events, inputs, outputs, interfaces, logic flow, allocation of CPU, allocation of memory resources, error and exception definition, error and exception isolation, and error recovery; – definition of the default state, in which all faults that can result in a hazardous situation are addressed, with events and transitions; – initialization of variables, memory management; and – cold and warm resets, standby, and other state changes that can affect the RISK CONTROL measures. B.5.5 SOFTWARE UNIT implementation and verification This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to write and verify the code for the SOFTWARE UNITS. The detailed design is to be translated into source code. Coding represents the point where decomposition of the specifications ends and composition of the executable software begins. To consistently achieve the desirable code characteristics, coding standards should be used to specify a preferred coding style. Examples of coding standards include requirements for understandability, language usage rules or restrictions, and complexity management. The code for each unit is VERIFIED to ensure that it functions as specified by the detailed design and that it complies with the specified coding standards. Subclause 5.5.5 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the code. If the code does not implement the design correctly, the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE will not perform as intended. B.5.6 Software integration and integration testing This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to plan and execute integration of SOFTWARE UNITS into aggregate SOFTWARE ITEMS as well as integration of SOFTWARE ITEMS into higher aggregated SOFTWARE ITEMS and to verify that the resulting SOFTWARE ITEMS behave as intended. The approach to integration can range from non-incremental integration to any form of incremental integration. The properties of the SOFTWARE ITEM being assembled dictate the chosen method of integration. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 52 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  Software integration testing focuses on the transfer of data and control across a SOFTWARE ITEM’s internal and external interfaces. External interfaces are those with other software, including operating system software, and MEDICAL DEVICE hardware. The rigor of integration testing and the level of detail of the documentation associated with integration testing should be commensurate with the RISK associated with the device, the device’s dependence on software for potentially hazardous functions, and the role of specific SOFTWARE ITEMS in higher RISK device functions. For example, although all SOFTWARE ITEMS should be tested, items that have an effect on SAFETY should be subject to more direct, thorough, and detailed tests. As applicable, integration testing demonstrates program behaviour at the boundaries of its input and output domains and confirms program responses to invalid, unexpected, and special inputs. The program’s actions are revealed when given combinations of inputs or unexpected sequences of inputs, or when defined timing requirements are violated. The test requirements in the plan should include, as appropriate, the types of white box testing to be performed as part of integration testing. White box testing, also known as glass box, structural, clear box and open box testing, is a testing technique where explicit knowledge of the internal workings of the SOFTWARE ITEM being tested are used to select the test data. White box testing uses specific knowledge of the SOFTWARE ITEM to examine outputs. The test is accurate only if the tester knows what the SOFTWARE ITEM is supposed to do. The tester can then see if the SOFTWARE ITEM diverges from its intended goal. White box testing cannot guarantee that the complete specification has been implemented since it is focused on testing the implementation of the SOFTWARE ITEM. Black box testing, also known as behavioural, functional, opaque-box, and closed-box testing, is focused on testing the functional specification and it cannot guarantee that all parts of the implementation have been tested. Thus black box testing is testing against the specification and will discover faults of omission, indicating that part of the specification has not been fulfilled. White box testing is testing against the implementation and will discover faults of commission, indicating that part of the implementation is faulty. In order to fully test a MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCT both black and white box testing might be required. The plans and test documentation identified in 5.6 and 5.7 can be individual documents tied to specific phases of development or evolutionary prototypes. They also might be combined so a single document or set of documents covers the requirements of multiple subsections. All or portions of the documents could be incorporated into higher level project documents such as a software or project quality assurance plan or a comprehensive test plan that addresses all aspects of testing for hardware and software. In these cases, a cross reference should be created that identifies how the various project documents relate to each of the software integration TASKS. Software integration testing can be performed in a simulated environment, on actual target hardware, or on the full MEDICAL DEVICE. Subclause 5.6.2 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the output of the software integration ACTIVITY.  The output of the software integration ACTIVITY is the integrated SOFTWARE ITEMS. These integrated SOFTWARE ITEMS must function properly for the entire MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE to function correctly and safely. B.5.7 SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the software’s functionality by verifying that the requirements for the software have been successfully implemented. SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing demonstrates that the specified functionality exists. This testing VERIFIES the functionality and performance of the program as built with respect to the requirements for the software. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 53 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing focuses on functional (black box) testing, although it might be desirable to use white box (see previous section) methods to more efficiently accomplish certain tests, initiate stress conditions or faults, or increase code coverage of the qualification tests. The organization of testing by types and test stage is flexible, but coverage of requirements, RISK CONTROL, usability, and test types (e.g., fault, installation, stress) should be demonstrated and documented. SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing tests the integrated software and can be performed in a simulated environment, on actual target hardware, or on the full MEDICAL DEVICE. When a change is made to a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (even a small change), the degree of REGRESSION TESTING (not just the testing of the individual change) should be determined to ensure that no unintended side effects have been introduced. This REGRESSION TESTING (and the rationale for not fully repeating SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing) should be planned and documented. (See B.6.3). SOFTWARE SYSTEM test responsibilities can be dispersed, occurring at different locations and being conducted by different organizations. However, regardless of the distribution of TASKS, contractual relations, source of components, or development environment, the device MANUFACTURER retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the software functions properly for its intended use. If ANOMALIES uncovered during testing can be repeated, but a decision has been made not to fix them, then these ANOMALIES need to be EVALUATED in relation to the HAZARD RISK analysis to verify that they do not affect the SAFETY of the device. The root cause and symptoms of the ANOMALIES should be understood, and the rationale for not fixing them should be documented. Subclause 5.7.4 requires the results of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing be EVALUATED to ensure that the expected results were obtained. B.5.8 Software release This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to document the VERSION of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE being released, specify how it was created, and follow appropriate procedures for release of the software.  The MANUFACTURER should be able to show that the software that was developed using the development PROCESS is the software that is being released. The MANUFACTURER should also be able to retrieve the software and the tools used for its generation in case it is needed in the future and should store, package, and deliver the software in a manner that minimizes the software from being damaged or misused. Defined procedures should be established to ensure that these TASKS are performed appropriately and with consistent results. B.6 Software maintenance PROCESS B.6.1 Establish software maintenance plan The software maintenance PROCESS differs from the software development PROCESS in two ways: – The MANUFACTURER is permitted to use a smaller PROCESS than the full software development PROCESS to implement rapid changes in response to urgent problems. – In responding to software PROBLEMS REPORTS relating to released product, the MANUFACTURER not only addresses the problem but also satisfies local regulations (typically by running a pro-active surveillance scheme for collecting problem data from the field and communicating with users and regulators about the problem). Subclause 6.1 requires these PROCESSES to be established in a maintenance plan. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 54 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to create or identify procedures for implementing maintenance ACTIVITIES and TASKS. To implement corrective actions, control changes during maintenance, and manage release of revised software, the MANUFACTURER should document and resolve reported problems and requests from users, as well as manage modifications to the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This PROCESS is activated when the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE undergoes modifications to code and associated documentation because of either a problem or the need for improvement or adaptation. The objective is to modify released MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE while preserving its integrity.  This PROCESS includes migration of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE to environments or platforms for which it was not originally released. The ACTIVITIES provided in this clause are specific to the maintenance PROCESS; however, the maintenance PROCESS might use other PROCESSES in this standard. The MANUFACTURER needs to plan how the ACTIVITIES and TASKS of the maintenance PROCESS will be performed. B.6.2 Problem and modification analysis  This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to analyze feedback for its effect; verify reported problems; and consider, select, and obtain approval for implementing a modification option. Problems and other requests for changes can affect the performance, SAFETY, or regulatory clearance of a MEDICAL DEVICE. An analysis is necessary to determine whether any effects exist because of a PROBLEM REPORT or whether any effects will result from a modification to correct a problem or implement a request. It is especially important to verify through trace or regression analysis that the RISK CONTROL measures built into the device are not adversely changed or modified by the software change that is being implemented as part of the software maintenance ACTIVITY. It is also important to verify that the modified software does not cause a HAZARD HAZARDOUS SITUATION or mitigate a RISK in software that previously did not cause a HAZARD HAZARDOUS SITUATION or mitigate RISKS. The software safety classification of a SOFTWARE ITEM might have changed if the software modification now can cause a HAZARD or mitigate a RISK. It is important to distinguish between software maintenance (Clause 6) and software problem resolution (Clause 9). The focus of the software maintenance PROCESS is an adequate response to feedback arising after release of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. As part of a MEDICAL DEVICE, the software maintenance PROCESS needs to ensure that: – SAFETY-related PROBLEM REPORTS are addressed and reported to appropriate regulatory authorities and affected users; – MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS are is re-validated and re-released after modification with formal controls that ensure the rectification of the problem and the avoidance of further problems; – the MANUFACTURER considers what other MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS might be affected and takes appropriate action. The focus of software problem resolution is the operation of a comprehensive control system that: • analyses PROBLEM REPORTS and identifies all the implications of the problem; • decides on a number of changes and identifies all their side-effects; • implements the changes while maintaining the consistency of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS including the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE; • VERIFIES the implementation of the changes. The software maintenance PROCESS uses the software problem resolution PROCESS. The software maintenance PROCESS handles the high-level decisions about the PROBLEM REPORT (whether a problem exists, whether it has a significant effect on SAFETY, what changes are needed and when to implement them), and uses the software problem resolution PROCESS to analyse the PROBLEM REPORT to discover all the implications and to generate possible CHANGE Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 55 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  REQUESTS which identify all the CONFIGURATION ITEMS that need to be changed and all the VERIFICATION steps that are necessary.  B.6.3 Modification implementation This ACTIVITY requires that the MANUFACTURER use an established PROCESS to make the modification. If a maintenance PROCESS has not been defined, the appropriate development PROCESS TASKS can be used to make the modification. The MANUFACTURER should also ensure that the modification does not cause a negative effect on other parts of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Unless the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is treated as a new development, analysis of the effect of a modification on the entire MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is necessary. Regression analysis and testing are employed to provide assurance that a change has not created problems elsewhere in the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Regression analysis is the determination of the impact of a change based on review of the relevant documentation (e.g., software requirements specification, software design specification, source code, test plans, test cases, test scripts, etc.) in order to identify the necessary regression tests to be run. Regression testing is the rerunning of test cases that a program has previously executed correctly and comparing the current result to the previous result in order to detect unintended effects of a software change. A rationale must be made that justifies the amount of REGRESSION TESTING that will be performed to ensure that the portions of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE not being modified still perform as they did before the modification was made. B.7 Software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Software RISK MANAGEMENT is a part of overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT and cannot be adequately addressed in isolation. This standard requires the use of a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS that is compliant with ISO 14971. RISK MANAGEMENT as defined in ISO 14971 deals specifically with a framework for effective management of the RISKS associated with the use of MEDICAL DEVICES. One portion of ISO 14971 pertains to control of identified RISKS associated with each HAZARD identified during the RISK ANALYSIS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this standard is intended to provide additional requirements for RISK CONTROL for software, including software that has been identified during the RISK ANALYSIS as potentially contributing to a hazardous situation, or software that is used to control MEDICAL DEVICE RISKS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS is included in this standard for two reasons. a) the intended audience of this standard needs to understand minimum requirements for RISK CONTROL measures in their area of responsibility—software; b) the general RISK MANAGEMENT standard, ISO 14971, provided as a normative reference in this standard, does not specifically address the RISK CONTROL of software and the placement of RISK CONTROL in the software development life cycle. Software RISK MANAGEMENT is a part of overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT. Plans, procedures, and documentation required for the software RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES can be a series of separate documents or a single document, or they can be integrated with the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES and documentation as long as all requirements in this standard are met. B.7.1 Analysis of software contributing to hazardous situations It is expected that the device HAZARD analysis will identify hazardous situations and corresponding RISK CONTROL measures to reduce the probability and/or severity of those hazardous situations to an acceptable level. It is also expected that the RISK CONTROL measures will be assigned to software functions that are expected to implement those RISK CONTROL measures.

At that time it is known how software functions will be implemented in software components, and the practicality of the RISK CONTROL measures assigned to software functions can be EVALUATED. At that time the device HAZARD analysis should be revised to include: • revised hazardous situations; • revised RISK CONTROL measures and software requirements; • new hazardous situations arising from software, for example hazardous situations related to human factors. The software ARCHITECTURE should include credible strategies for segregating software components so that they do not interact in unsafe ways. B.8 Software configuration management PROCESS The software configuration management PROCESS is a PROCESS of applying administrative and technical procedures throughout the software life cycle to identify and define SOFTWARE ITEMS, including documentation, in a SYSTEM; control modifications and releases of the items; and document and report the status of the items and CHANGE REQUESTS. Software configuration management is necessary to recreate a SOFTWARE ITEM, to identify its constituent parts, and to provide a history of the changes that have been made to it. B.8.1 Configuration identification This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to uniquely identify software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and their VERSIONS. This identification is necessary to identify the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and the VERSIONS that are included in the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. B.8.2 Change control This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to control changes of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and to document information identifying CHANGE REQUESTS and providing documentation about their disposition. This ACTIVITY is necessary to ensure that unauthorized or unintended changes are not made to the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and to ensure that approved CHANGE REQUESTS are implemented fully and verified. CHANGE REQUESTS can be approved by a change control board or by a manager or technical lead according to the software configuration management plan. Approved CHANGE REQUESTS are made traceable to the actual modification and VERIFICATION of the software. The requirement is that each actual change be linked to a CHANGE REQUEST and that documentation exists to show that the CHANGE REQUEST was approved. The documentation might be change control board minutes, an approval signature, or a record in a database. B.8.3 Configuration status accounting  This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to maintain records of the history of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS. This ACTIVITY is necessary to determine when and why changes were made.  Access to this information is necessary to ensure that software CONFIGURATION ITEMS contain only authorized modifications. B.9 Software problem resolution PROCESS The software problem resolution PROCESS is a PROCESS for analyzing and resolving the problems (including non-conformances), whatever their nature or source, including those discovered during the execution of development, maintenance, or other PROCESSES. The objective is to provide a timely, responsible, and documented means to ensure that discovered problems are analyzed and resolved and that trends are recognized.

It is called “problem resolution” in ISO/IEC 12207 [9] and IEC 60601-1-4 [2], Amendment 1. We have chosen to call it “software problem resolution” in this standard. This ACTIVITY requires that the MANUFACTURER use the software problem resolution PROCESS when a problem or non-conformance is identified. This ACTIVITY is necessary to ensure that discovered problems are analyzed and EVALUATED for possible relevance to SAFETY (as specified in ISO 14971). Software development plan(s) or procedures, as required in 5.1, are to address how problems or non-conformances will be handled. This includes specifying at each stage of the life cycle the aspects of the software problem resolution PROCESS that will be formal and documented as well as when problems and nonconformities are to be entered into the software problem resolution PROCESS.

The software is considered a subsystem of the MEDICAL DEVICE or is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE. This standard is to be used together with other appropriate standards when developing a MEDICAL DEVICE. MEDICAL DEVICE management standards such as ISO 13485 [8] (see C.2 and Annex D) and ISO 14971 (see Annex C.3) provide a management environment that lays a foundation for an organization to develop products. Safety standards such as IEC 60601-1 [1] (see Annex C.4) and IEC 61010-1 [5] (see Annex C.5) give specific direction for creating safe MEDICAL DEVICES. When software is a part of these MEDICAL DEVICES, IEC 62304 provides more detailed direction on what is required to develop and maintain safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Many other standards such as ISO/IEC 12207 [9] (see Annex C.6), IEC 61508-3 [4] (see Annex C.7) and ISO/IEC 90003 [15] can be looked to as a source of methods, tools and techniques that can be used to implement the requirements in IEC 62304. Figure C.1 shows the relationship of these standards. Where clauses or requirements from other standards are quoted, defined terms in the quoted items are terms that are defined in the other standard, not defined terms in this standard.

This standard identifies requirements for software which are in addition to, but not incompatible with, the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005 /AMD1:2012 [1] for PEMS. Because PEMS include elements that are not software, not all of the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 for PEMS are addressed in this standard. With the publication of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005 /AMD1:2012, IEC 62304 is now a normative reference of IEC 60601-1 and compliance with Clause 14 of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 (and thus compliance with the standard) requires compliance with parts of IEC 62304 (not with the whole of IEC 62304 because IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 does not require compliance with post-production and maintenance requirements of IEC 62304). Finally, it is important to remember that IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 is only used if the software is part of a PEMS and not if the software is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE. C.4.2 Software relationship to PEMS development By using the V-model illustrated in Figure C.2 to describe what occurs during a PEMS development, it can be seen that the requirements of this software standard apply at the PEMS component level, from the specification of the software requirements to the integration of the SOFTWARE ITEMS into a SOFTWARE SYSTEM. This SOFTWARE SYSTEM is a part of a programmable electrical subsystem (PESS), which is a part of a PEMS.

These requirements relate to the PEMS requirements in IEC 60601-1 for development life cycle, requirement specification, ARCHITECTURE, design and implementation, and VERIFICATION. The requirements in this standard provide greater detail about software development than those in IEC 60601-1. C.4.4 Maintenance PROCESS Compliance with the software maintenance PROCESS of this standard (Clause 6) requires that procedures be established and followed when changes to software are made. These require-ments correspond to the requirement in IEC 60601-1 for modification of a PEMS. The requirements in this standard for software maintenance provide greater detail about what must be done for software maintenance than the requirements for PEMS modification in IEC 60601-1. C.4.5 Other PROCESSES The other PROCESSES in this standard specify additional requirements for software beyond the similar requirements for PEMS in IEC 60601-1. In most cases, there is a general requirement for PEMS in IEC 60601-1, which the PROCESSES in this standard expand upon. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this standard corresponds to the additional RISK MANAGEMENT requirements identified for PEMS in IEC 60601-1.

The requirements in 14.13 are applicable to any PEMS intended to be incorporated into an  IT-NETWORK whether or not the requirements in 14.2 to 14.12 apply. When the requirements in 14.2 to 14.13 apply, the requirements in subclause 4.3, Clause 5, Clause 7, Clause 8 and Clause 9 of IEC 62304:2006 shall also apply to the development or modification of software for each PESS. 4.3 Software safety classification The PEMS requirements of IEC 60601-1 would only apply to software safety classes B and C. This standard includes some requirements for software safety class A.           The software development PROCESS required for compliance with IEC 60601-1 does not include the post production monitoring and maintenance required by Clause 6 of IEC 62304:2006. 14.2 Documentation In addition to the records and documents required by ISO 14971, the documents produced from application of Clause 14 shall be maintained and shall form part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.2 RISK MANAGEMENT  The documents required by Clause 14 shall be reviewed, approved, issued and changed in accordance with a formal document control procedure. 5.1 Software development planning In addition to the specific requirements in the software development planning ACTIVITY, documents that are part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE are required to be maintained by ISO 14971. In addition, for documents that are required by the quality system, ISO 13485 [8] requires control of the documents. 14.3 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN The RISK MANAGEMENT plan required by 3.5 of ISO 14971 4.2.2 shall also include a reference to the PEMS VALIDATION plan (see 14.11).  Not specifically required. There is no specific software validation plan. The PEMS validation plan is at the SYSTEM level and thus is outside the scope of this software standard.  This standard does require TRACEABILITY from HAZARD to specific software cause to RISK CONTROL measure to VERIFICATION of the RISK CONTROL measure (see 7.3)  14.4 PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE A PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall be documented. 5.1 Software development planning 5.1.1 Software development plan The items addressed by the software development plan constitute a SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE. The PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall contain a set of defined milestones.  At each milestone, the ACTIVITIES to be completed and the VERIFICATION methods to be applied to those activities shall be defined. 5.1.6 Software VERIFICATION planning  VERIFICATION TASKS, milestones and acceptance criteria must be planned. Each activity shall be defined including its inputs and outputs. 5.1.1 Software development plan ACTIVITIES are defined in this standard.  Documentation to be produced is defined in each ACTIVITY. Each milestone shall identify the RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES that must be completed before that milestone.  The PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall be tailored for a specific development by making plans which detail ACTIVITIES, milestones and schedules. 5.1.1 Software development plan This standard allows the development life cycle to be documented in the development plan. This means the development plan contains a tailored development life cycle.

C.5 Relationship to IEC 61010-1 The scope of IEC 61010-1 [4 5] covers electrical test and measuring equipment, electrical control equipment and electrical laboratory equipment. Only part of the laboratory equipment is used in a medical environment or as in vitro diagnostic equipment (IVD).  Due to legal regulations or normative references, IVD equipment is allocated to MEDICAL DEVICES without, however, falling within the scope of IEC 60601-1 [1]. This is attributable not only to the fact that, strictly speaking, IVD instruments are not MEDICAL DEVICES which come into direct contact with patients, but also to the fact that such products are manufactured for many different applications in various laboratories. Use as an IVD instrument or as an accessory for an IVD instrument is then rare. If laboratory equipment is used as IVD equipment, the measured results obtained must be EVALUATED in accordance with medical criteria. The application of ISO 14971 is required for RISK MANAGEMENT. If such products also contain software that can lead to a HAZARD HAZARDOUS SITUATION, for example failure caused by the software which results in an unwanted change of medical data (measuring results), IEC 62304 must be taken into account. IEC 61010-1:2010 has a general requirement for risk assessment in Clause 17, which is more streamlined than the full risk management requirements of ISO 14971. Applying IEC 61010-1 Clause 17 alone does not meet the required criteria for risk management of IEC 62304, which is based on full ISO 14971 risk management requirements. With this in mind, it is expected by this standard that when an IVD medical device has software-related risks, its risk management process is performed following ISO 14971 instead of only Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1. Compliance with Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1 will be achieved, as detailed in the Note to Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1: NOTE One RISK assessment procedure is outlined in Annex J. Other RISK assessment procedures are contained in ISO 14971, SEMI S10-1296, IEC 61508, ISO 14121-1, and ANSI B11.TR3. Other established procedures which implement similar steps can also be used.

This standard differs from ISO/IEC 12207 mainly with respect to the following. It: • excludes SYSTEM aspects, such as SYSTEM requirements, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and validation; • omits some PROCESSES seen as duplicating ACTIVITIES documented elsewhere for MEDICAL DEVICES; • adds the (SAFETY) RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and the software release PROCESS; • incorporates the documentation and the VERIFICATION supporting PROCESSES into the development and maintenance PROCESSES; • merges the PROCESS implementation and planning ACTIVITIES of each PROCESS into a single ACTIVITY in the development and maintenance PROCESSES; • classifies the requirements with respect to SAFETY needs; and • does not explicitly classify PROCESSES as primary or supporting, nor group PROCESSES as ISO/IEC 12207 does. Most of these changes were driven by the desire to tailor the standard to the need of the MEDICAL DEVICE sector by: • focusing on SAFETY aspects and the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT standard ISO 14971; • selecting the appropriate PROCESSES useful in a regulated environment; • taking into account that software development is embedded in a quality system (which covers some of the PROCESSES and requirements of ISO/IEC 12207); and • lowering the level of abstraction to make it easier to use. This standard is not contradictory to ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/IEC 12207 can be useful as an aide in setting up a well structured SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL that includes the requirements of this standard.

The approach to safety in IEC 62304 is fundamentally different than the one in IEC 61508. IEC 62304 takes into account that the effectiveness of medical devices justifies residual risks related to their use. The following explains the stance of this standard.  IEC 61508 addresses 3 main issues: 1) RISK MANAGEMENT life cycle and life cycle PROCESSES; 2) definition of Safety Integrity Levels; 3) recommendation of techniques, tools and methods for software development and levels of independence of personnel responsible for performing different TASKS. Issue 1) is covered in this standard by a normative reference to ISO 14971 (the MEDICAL DEVICE sector standard for RISK MANAGEMENT). The effect of this reference is to adopt ISO 14971’s approach to RISK MANAGEMENT as an integral part of the software PROCESS for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. For issue 2), this standard takes a simpler approach than IEC 61508. The latter classifies software into 4 “Safety Integrity Levels” defined in terms of reliability objectives. The reliability objectives are identified after RISK ANALYSIS, which quantifies both the severity and the probability of HARM caused by a failure of the software.

Classification into 3 software safety classes is based only on the severity of that HARM caused by a failure.  After classification, different PROCESSES are required for different software safety classes: the intention is to further reduce the probability (and/or the severity) of failure of the software. Issue 3) is not addressed by this standard. Readers of the standard are encouraged to use IEC 61508 as a source for good software methods, techniques and tools, while recognising that other approaches, both present and future, can provide equally good results. This standard makes no recommendation concerning independence of people responsible for one software ACTIVITY (for example VERIFICATION) from those responsible for another (for example design). In particular, this standard makes no requirement for an independent safety assessor, since this is a matter for ISO 14971.

It also considers that other standards like ISO 13485 [8] require adequate and comparable PROCESSES. D.2 Quality management system For MANUFACTURERS of MEDICAL DEVICES, including MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE in the context of this standard, the establishment of a quality management system (QMS) is required in 4.1. This standard does not require that the QMS necessarily has to be certified. D.3 EVALUATE quality management PROCESSES It is recommended to EVALUATE how well the established and documented PROCESSES of the QMS already cover the PROCESSES of the software life cycle, by means of audits, inspections, or analyses under the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER.  Any identified gaps can be accommodated by extending the QM PROCESSES, or can be separately described. If the MANUFACTURER already has PROCESS descriptions available which regulate the development, VERIFICATION and validation of software, then these should also be EVALUATED to determine how well they agree with this standard. D.4 Integrating requirements of this standard into the MANUFACTURER’S quality management PROCESSES This standard can be implemented by adapting or extending the PROCESSES already installed in the QMS system, or integrating new PROCESSES. This standard does not specify how this is to be done; the MANUFACTURER is free to do this in any suitable way. The MANUFACTURER is responsible for ensuring that the PROCESSES described in this standard are suitably put into action when the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is developed by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or sub-contractors not having their own documented QMS. D.5 Checklist for small MANUFACTURERS without a certified QMS The MANUFACTURER should determine the highest software safety classification (A, B or C) of the software. Table D.1 lists all ACTIVITIES described in this standard. The reference to ISO 13485 should help to define the place in the QMS. Based on the required software safety class, the MANUFACTURER should assess each required ACTIVITY against the existing PROCESSES. If the requirement is already covered, a reference to the relevant PROCESS descriptions should be given. If there is discrepancy, an action is needed to improve the PROCESS. The list can also be used for an EVALUATION of the PROCESSES after the action has been performed.

DEVICE SOFTWARE –  SOFTWARE LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES   FOREWORD 1) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. DISCLAIMER This Consolidated version is not an official IEC Standard and has been prepared for user convenience. Only the current versions of the standard and its amendment(s) are to be considered the official documents. This Consolidated version of IEC 62304 bears the edition number 1.1. It consists of the first edition (2006-05) [documents 62A/523/FDIS and 62A/528/RVD] and its amendment 1 (2015-06) [documents 62A/1007/FDIS and 62A/1014/RVD]. The technical content is identical to the base edition and its amendment. This Final version does not show where the technical content is modified by  amendment 1. A separate Redline version with all changes highlighted is available in this publication.

Table C.5 was prepared by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, Software and system engineering. It is published as a dual logo standard. This publication has been drafted in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. In this standard the following print types are used: • requirements and definitions: in roman type; • informative material appearing outside of tables, such as notes, examples and references: in smaller type. Normative text of tables is also in a smaller type; • terms used throughout this standard that have been defined in Clause 3 and also given in the index: in small capitals.

Establishing the SAFETY and effectiveness of a MEDICAL DEVICE containing software requires knowledge of what the software is intended to do and demonstration that the use of the software fulfils those intentions without causing any unacceptable RISKS.  This standard provides a framework of life cycle PROCESSES with ACTIVITIES and TASKS necessary for the safe design and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This standard provides requirements for each life cycle PROCESS. Each life cycle PROCESS consists of a set of ACTIVITIES, with most ACTIVITIES consisting of a set of TASKS. As a basic foundation it is assumed that MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is developed and maintained within a quality management system (see 4.1) and a RISK MANAGEMENT system (see 4.2). The RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS is already very well addressed by the International Standard ISO 14971. Therefore IEC 62304 makes use of this advantage simply by a normative reference to ISO 14971. Some minor additional RISK MANAGEMENT requirements are needed for software, especially in the area of identification of contributing software factors related to HAZARDS. These requirements are summarized and captured in Clause 7 as the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. Whether software is a contributing factor to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION is determined during the HAZARD identification ACTIVITY of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that could be indirectly caused by software (for example, by providing misleading information that could cause inappropriate treatment to be administered) need to be considered when determining whether software is a contributing factor. The decision to use software to control RISK is made during the RISK CONTROL ACTIVITY of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS required in this standard has to be embedded in the device RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS according to ISO 14971. The software development PROCESS consists of a number of ACTIVITIES. These ACTIVITIES are shown in Figure 1 and described in Clause 5. Because many incidents in the field are related to service or maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEMS including inappropriate software updates and upgrades, the software maintenance PROCESS is considered to be as important as the software development PROCESS. The software maintenance PROCESS is very similar to the software development PROCESS. It is shown in Figure 2 and described in Clause 6.

This standard does not specify an organizational structure for the MANUFACTURER or which part of the organization is to perform which PROCESS, ACTIVITY, or TASK. This standard requires only that the PROCESS, ACTIVITY, or TASK be completed to establish compliance with this standard. This standard does not prescribe the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation to be produced. This standard requires documentation of TASKS, but the decision of how to package this documentation is left to the user of the standard. This standard does not prescribe a specific life cycle model. The users of this standard are responsible for selecting a life cycle model for the software project and for mapping the PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS in this standard onto that model. Annex A provides rationale for the clauses of this standard. Annex B provides guidance on the provisions of this standard. For the purposes of this standard: • “shall” means that compliance with a requirement is mandatory for compliance with this standard; • “should” means that compliance with a requirement is recommended but is not mandatory for compliance with this standard; • “may” is used to describe a permissible way to achieve compliance with a requirement; • “establish” means to define, document, and implement; and • where this standard uses the term “as appropriate” in conjunction with a required PROCESS, ACTIVITY, TASK or output, the intention is that the MANUFACTURER shall use the PROCESS, ACTIVITY, TASK or output unless the MANUFACTURER can document a justification for not so doing.  INTRODUCTION to Amendment 1 The first edition of IEC 62304 was published in 2006. This amendment is intended to add requirements to deal with LEGACY SOFTWARE, where the software design is prior to the existence of the current version, to assist manufacturers who must show compliance to the standard to meet European Directives. Software safety classification changes needed for this amendment include clarification of requirements and updating of the software safety classification to include a risk-based approach.  Work is continuing in parallel to develop the second edition of IEC 62304.

The set of PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS described in this standard establishes a common framework for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE life cycle PROCESSES. 1.2 * Field of application This standard applies to the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE when software is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE or when software is an embedded or integral part of the final MEDICAL DEVICE. NOTE 1 This standard can be used in the development and maintenance of software that is itself a medical device.  However, additional development activities are needed at the system level before this type of software can be placed into service.  These system activities are not covered by this standard, but can be found in IEC 82304-11 [22]. This standard describes PROCESSES that are intended to be applied to software which executes on a processor or which is executed by other software (for example an interpreter) which executes on a processor. This standard applies regardless of the persistent storage device(s) used to store the software (for example: hard disk, optical disk, permanent or flash memory). This standard applies regardless of the method of delivery of the software (for example: transmission by network or email, optical disk, flash memory or EEPROM). The method of software delivery itself is not considered MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This standard does not cover validation and final release of the MEDICAL DEVICE, even when the MEDICAL DEVICE consists entirely of software. NOTE 2 If a medical device incorporates embedded software intended to be executed on a processor, the requirements of this standard apply to the software, including the requirements concerning software of unknown provenance (see 8.1.2). NOTE 3 Validation and other development activities are needed at the system level before the software and medical device can be placed into service.  These system activities are not covered by this standard, but can be found in related product standards (e.g., IEC 60601-1, IEC 82304-1, etc.).  1.3 Relationship to other standards This MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE life cycle standard is to be used together with other appropriate standards when developing a MEDICAL DEVICE. Annex C shows the relationship between this standard and other relevant standards. 1.4 Compliance Compliance with this standard is defined as implementing all of the PROCESSES, ACTIVITIES, and TASKS identified in this standard in accordance with the software safety class. NOTE  The software safety classes assigned to each requirement are identified in the normative text following the requirement. ___________ 1  In preparation.

The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class B if: – the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is non-SERIOUS INJURY. The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class C if: – the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is death or SERIOUS INJURY. For a SOFTWARE SYSTEM initially classified as software safety class B or C, the MANUFACTURER may implement additional RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM (including revising the system architecture containing the SOFTWARE SYSTEM) and subsequently assign a new software safety classification to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM.

A.1 Rationale The primary requirement of this standard is that a set of PROCESSES be followed in the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, and that the choice of PROCESSES be appropriate to the RISKS to the patient and other people. This follows from the belief that testing of software is not sufficient to determine that it is safe in operation. The PROCESSES required by this standard fall into two categories: – PROCESSES which are required to determine the RISKS arising from the operation of each SOFTWARE ITEM in the software; – PROCESSES which are required to achieve an appropriately low probability of software failure for each SOFTWARE ITEM, chosen on the basis of these determined RISKS. This standard requires the first category to be performed for all MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE and the second category to be performed for selected SOFTWARE ITEMS. A claim of compliance with this standard should therefore include a documented RISK ANALYSIS that identifies foreseeable sequences of events that include software and that can result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (see ISO 14971). HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that can be indirectly caused by software (for example, by providing misleading information that could cause inappropriate treatment to be administered) should be included in this RISK ANALYSIS. All ACTIVITIES that are required as part of the first category of PROCESSES are identified in the normative text as "[Class A, B, C]", indicating that they are required irrespective of the classification of the software to which they apply. ACTIVITIES are required for all classes A, B, and C for the following reasons: – the ACTIVITY produces a plan relevant to RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY produces an output that is an input to RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY is a part of RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY establishes an administration system, documentation or record-keeping system that supports RISK MANAGEMENT or software safety classification; – the ACTIVITY normally takes place when the classification of the related software is unknown; – the ACTIVITY can cause a change that could invalidate the current software safety classification of the associated software. This includes the discovery and analysis of safety related problems after release. Other PROCESSES are required only for SOFTWARE SYSTEMS or SOFTWARE ITEMS classified in software safety classes B or C. ACTIVITIES required as parts of these PROCESSES are identified in the normative text as "[Class B, C]", or "[Class C]" indicating that they are required selectively depending on the classification of the software to which they apply.

ACTIVITIES are required selectively for software in class C for the following reasons: – the ACTIVITY further enhances the reliability of the software by requiring more detail, or more rigour, or attention to specific issues in the design, testing or other VERIFICATION Note that all PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES defined in this standard are considered valuable in assuring the development and maintenance of high quality software. The omission of many of these PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES as requirements for software in class A should not imply that these PROCESSES and ACTIVITIES would not be of value or are not recommended. Their omission is intended to recognize that software that cannot cause a HAZARD can be assured of SAFETY and effectiveness primarily through overall validation ACTIVITY during the design of a MEDICAL DEVICE (which is outside the scope of this standard) and through some simple software life cycle controls.

To accomplish this, the standard identifies the minimum ACTIVITIES and TASKS that need to be accomplished to provide confidence that the software has been developed in a manner that is likely to produce highly reliable and safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This annex provides guidance for the application of the requirements of this standard.  It does not add to, or otherwise change, the requirements of this standard. This annex can be used to better understand the requirements of this standard. Note that in this standard, ACTIVITIES are subclauses called out within the PROCESSES and TASKS are defined within the ACTIVITIES. For example, the ACTIVITIES defined for the software development PROCESS are software development planning, software requirements analysis, software ARCHITECTURAL design, software detailed design, SOFTWARE UNIT implementation and VERIFICATION, software integration and integration testing, SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing, and software release. The TASKS within these ACTIVITIES are the individual requirements. This standard does not require a particular SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL. However, compliance with this standard does imply dependencies between PROCESSES, because inputs of a PROCESS are generated by another PROCESS. For example, the software safety classification of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM should be completed after the RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS has established what HARM could arise from failure of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM. Because of such logical dependencies between processes, it is easiest to describe the processes in this standard in a sequence, implying a “waterfall” or “once-through” life cycle model. However, other life cycles can also be used. Some development (model) strategies as defined at ISO/IEC 12207 [9] include (see also Table B.1): – Waterfall. The “once-through" strategy, also called “waterfall”, consists of performing the development PROCESS a single time. Simplistically: determine customer needs, define requirements, design the SYSTEM, implement the system, test, fix and deliver. – Incremental: The “incremental” strategy determines customer needs and defines the SYSTEM requirements, then performs the rest of the development in a sequence of builds. The first build incorporates part of the planned capabilities, the next build adds more capabilities, and so on, until the SYSTEM is complete. – Evolutionary: The “evolutionary” strategy also develops a SYSTEM in builds but differs from the incremental strategy in acknowledging that the user need is not fully understood and all requirements cannot be defined up front. In this strategy, customer needs and SYSTEM requirements are partially defined up front, then are refined in each succeeding build.

Multiple development cycles? Distribute interim software? Waterfall   (Once-through) yes no no Incremental (Preplanned product improvement) yes yes maybe Evolutionary no yes yes  Whichever life cycle is chosen it is necessary to maintain the logical dependencies between PROCESS outputs such as specifications, design documents and software. The waterfall life cycle model achieves this by delaying the start of a PROCESS until the inputs for that PROCESS are complete and approved. Other life cycles, particularly evolutionary life cycles, permit PROCESS outputs to be produced before all the inputs for that PROCESS are available. For example, a new SOFTWARE ITEM can be specified, classified, implemented and VERIFIED before the whole software ARCHITECTURE has been finalised. Such life cycles carry the RISK that a change or development in one PROCESS output will invalidate another PROCESS output. All life cycles therefore use a comprehensive configuration management system to ensure that all PROCESS outputs are brought to a consistent state and the dependencies maintained. The following principles are important regardless of the software development life cycle used: – All PROCESS outputs should be maintained in a consistent state; whenever any PROCESS output is created or changed, all related PROCESS outputs should be updated promptly to maintain their consistency with each other and to maintain all dependencies explicitly or implicitly required by this standard; – all PROCESS outputs should be available when needed as input to further work on the software.  – before any MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is released, all PROCESS outputs should be consistent with each other and all dependencies between PROCESS outputs explicitly or implicitly required by this standard should be observed. B.1.2 Field of application This standard applies to the development and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE as well as the development and maintenance of a MEDICAL DEVICE that includes SOUP. The use of this standard requires the MANUFACTURER to perform MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT that is compliant with ISO 14971. Therefore, when the MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE includes an acquired component (this could be a purchased component or a component of unknown provenance), such as a printer/plotter that includes SOUP, the acquired component becomes the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER and must be included in the RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL DEVICE. It is assumed that through proper performance of MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT, the MANUFACTURER would understand the component and recognize that it includes SOUP. The MANUFACTURER using this standard would invoke the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS as part of the overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. The maintenance of released MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE applies to the post-production experience with the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Software maintenance includes the combination of all technical and administrative means, including supervision actions, to act on problem reports to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function as well as modification requests related to released MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. For example, this includes problem rectification, regulatory reporting, re-validation and preventive action. See ISO/IEC 14764 [10].

This guidance is not required by this standard but is highly recommended. B.3 Terms and definitions Where possible, terms have been defined using definitions from international standards. This standard chose to use three terms to describe the decomposition of a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (top level). The SOFTWARE SYSTEM can be a subsystem of the MEDICAL DEVICE (see IEC 60601-1-4 [2]) or a MEDICAL DEVICE in its own right, which then becomes a software MEDICAL DEVICE. The lowest level that is not further decomposed for the purposes of testing or software configuration management is the SOFTWARE UNIT. All levels of composition, including the top and bottom levels, can be called SOFTWARE ITEMS. A SOFTWARE SYSTEM, then, is composed of one or more SOFTWARE ITEMS, and each SOFTWARE ITEM is composed of one or more SOFTWARE UNITS or decomposable SOFTWARE ITEMS. The responsibility is left to the MANUFACTURER to provide the definition and granularity of the SOFTWARE ITEMS and SOFTWARE UNITS. Leaving these terms vague allows one to apply them to the many different development methods and types of software used in MEDICAL DEVICES. B.4 General requirements There is no known method to guarantee 100 % SAFETY for any kind of software. There are three major principles which promote SAFETY for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE: – RISK MANAGEMENT; – quality management; – software engineering. For the development and maintenance of safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE it is necessary to establish RISK MANAGEMENT as an integral part of a quality management system as an overall framework for the application of appropriate software engineering methods and techniques. The combination of these three concepts allows a MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER to follow a clearly structured and consistently repeatable decision-making PROCESS to promote SAFETY for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. B.4.1 Quality management system A disciplined and effective set of software PROCESSES includes organizational PROCESSES such as management, infrastructure, improvement, and training. To avoid duplication and to focus this standard on software engineering, these PROCESSES have been omitted from this standard. These PROCESSES are covered by a quality management system. ISO 13485 [8] is an International Standard that is specifically intended for applying the concepts of quality management to MEDICAL DEVICES. Conformance to ISO 13485 quality management system requirements does not automatically constitute conformity with national or regional regulatory requirements. It is the MANUFACTURER’S responsibility to identify and establish compliance with relevant regulatory requirements.  B.4.2 RISK MANAGEMENT Software development participates in RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES sufficiently to ensure that all reasonably foreseeable RISKS associated with the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE are considered. Rather than trying to define an appropriate RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this software engineering standard, it is required that the MANUFACTURER apply a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 41 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  that is compliant with  ISO 14971, which deals explicitly with RISK MANAGEMENT for MEDICAL DEVICES. Specific software RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES resulting from HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that have software as a contributing cause are identified in a supporting PROCESS described in Clause 7. B.4.3 Software safety classification The RISK associated with software as a part of a MEDICAL DEVICE, as an accessory to a MEDICAL DEVICE, or as a MEDICAL DEVICE in its own right, is used as the input to a software safety classification scheme, which then determines the PROCESSES to be used during the development and maintenance of software. RISK is considered to be a combination of the severity of HARM and the probability of its occurrence. However, no consensus exists for a method of quantitatively estimating the probability of occurrence of a software failure. When software is present in a sequence or combination of events leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the probability of the software failure occurring cannot be considered in estimating the RISK for the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. In such cases, considering a worst case probability is appropriate, and the probability for the software failure occurring should be set to 1. When it is possible to estimate the probability for the remaining events in the sequence (as it may be if they are not software) that probability can be used for the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring (P1 in Figure B.2). In many cases however, it might not be possible to estimate the probability for the remaining events in the sequence, and the RISK should be EVALUATED on the basis of the nature of the HARM alone (the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring should be set to 1). RISK ESTIMATION in these cases should be focused on the SEVERITY of the HARM resulting from the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Subjective rankings of probability can also be assigned based on clinical knowledge to distinguish failures that a clinician would be likely to detect from those that would not be detected and would be more likely to cause HARM. Estimates of probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION leading to HARM (P2 in Figure B.2) generally require clinical knowledge to distinguish between HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS where clinical practice would be likely to prevent HARM, and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that would be more likely to cause HARM.

It is only possible to determine the RISK associated with failure of a SOFTWARE ITEM: – if a SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and a software ARCHITECTURE define the role of the SOFTWARE ITEM in terms of its purpose and its interfaces with other software and hardware items; – if changes to the SYSTEM are controlled; – after RISK ANALYSIS has been done on the ARCHITECTURE and RISK CONTROL measures specified. This standard requires the minimum number of ACTIVITIES that will achieve the above conditions for all classes of software. The end of the software ARCHITECTURE ACTIVITY is the earliest point in the development when the full set of SOFTWARE ITEMS is defined and the RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY has identified how the SOFTWARE ITEMS relate to SAFETY. This is therefore the earliest point at which SOFTWARE ITEMS can be classified definitively according to their SAFETY role. This point corresponds to the point where RISK CONTROL is begun in ISO 14971. Before this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS identifies ARCHITECTURAL RISK CONTROL measures, for example adding protective subsystems, or reducing the opportunities for software failures to cause HARM. After this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS uses PROCESSES aimed at reducing the probability of failure of SOFTWARE ITEMS. In other words, the classification of a SOFTWARE ITEM specifies PROCESS-based RISK CONTROL measures to be applied to that item.

The software safety classification scheme is not intended to align with the RISK classifications of ISO 14971. Whereas the ISO 14971 scheme classifies RISK according to their severity and likelihood, the software safety classification scheme classifies SOFTWARE SYSTEMS and SOFTWARE ITEMS according to the PROCESSES to be applied in their development and maintenance. As the design evolves, new RISKS might become evident. Therefore, RISK MANAGEMENT should be applied as an integral part of the development PROCESS. This permits the development of an ARCHITECTURAL design that identifies a complete set of SOFTWARE ITEMS, including those that are required to function correctly to assure safe operation and those that prevent faults from causing HARM. The software ARCHITECTURE should promote segregation of software items that are required for safe operation and should describe the methods used to ensure effective segregation of those SOFTWARE ITEMS. Segregation is not restricted to physical (processor or memory partition) separation but includes any mechanism that prevents one SOFTWARE ITEM from negatively affecting another. The adequacy of a segregation is determined based on the RISKS involved and the rationale which is required to be documented. As stated in B.3, this standard chooses to use three terms to describe the decomposition of a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (top level).  Figure B.1 illustrates the possible partitioning for SOFTWARE ITEMS within a SOFTWARE SYSTEM and how the software safety classes would be applied to the group of SOFTWARE ITEMS in the decomposition.

The MANUFACTURER is able to segregate all SOFTWARE SYSTEM contributions to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS which could result in death or SERIOUS INJURY to SOFTWARE ITEM Z and all remaining SOFTWARE SYSTEM contributions to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS  which could result in a non-SERIOUS INJURY to SOFTWARE ITEM W. SOFTWARE ITEm W is classified as software safety class B and SOFTWARE ITEM Z is at software safety class C. SOFTWARE ITEM Y therefore must be classified as Class C, per 4.3 d). The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is also at a software safety class C per this requirement. SOFTWARE ITEM X has been classified at a software safety class of A. The MANUFACTURER is able to document a rationale for the segregation between SOFTWARE ITEMS X and Y, as well as SOFTWARE ITEMS W and Z, to assure the integrity of the segregation. If segregation is not possible between SOFTWARE ITEMS X and Y, then SOFTWARE ITEM X must be classified in software safety class C. B.4.4 LEGACY SOFTWARE Subclause 4.4 establishes a process for application of this standard to LEGACY SOFTWARE. Some geographies may require the MANUFACTURER to show conformity to the standard to obtain regulatory approval of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, even if that software was designed prior to the existence of the current version of the standard (LEGACY SOFTWARE).  In this case, the requirements in 4.4 provide a method for the the MANUFACTURER to demonstrate compliance of LEGACY SOFTWARE to the standard.  A MANUFACTURER may determine that retrospective documentation of an already finished development-lifecycle performed as an isolated activity does not result in the reduction of RISK associated with the use of the product. The process results in the identification of a subset of IEC   724/06 Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 45 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  ACTIVITIES defined in this standard which does result in reduction of RISK. Some additional goals implicit in the process are: – required ACTIVITIES and resulting documentation should rely on and make use of, wherever possible, existing documentation, and – a MANUFACTURER should utilize resources as effectively as possible to effect a reduction of RISK. In addition to a plan identifying the subset of ACTIVITIES to execute, the process also results in objective evidence supporting safe continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE and a summary rationale for this conclusion. The RISKS associated with the planned continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE depend on the context in which the LEGACY SOFTWARE will be used to create a SOFTWARE SYSTEM. The MANUFACTURER will document all identified MEDICAL DEVICE HAZARDS associated with the LEGACY SOFTWARE. Subclause 4.4 requires a comprehensive assessment of available post-production field data obtained for the LEGACY SOFTWARE during the time it has been in production and use. Typical sources of post-production data include: – adverse events attributable to the device, – feedback received from users of the device, and – ANOMALIES discovered by the MANUFACTURER. Though no consensus exists for a method of prospectively estimating quantitatively the probability of occurrence of a software failure, such information may be available for LEGACY SOFTWARE, based on the usage of such software and EVALUATION of post-production data. If it is possible in such cases to quantitatively estimate the probability of events in the sequence, a quantitative value may be used for expressing the probability of the entire sequence of events occurring. If such quantitative estimation is not possible, considering a worst case probability is appropriate, and the probability for the software failure occurring should be assumed to be 1. The MANUFACTURER determination of how the LEGACY SOFTWARE will be used in the overall MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE is input to the assessment of RISK. The RISKS to be considered vary accordingly. – When LEGACY SOFTWARE has been safely and reliably used and the MANUFACTURER wishes to continue use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the rationale for continued use rests primarily on the assessment of RISK based on post-production records. – When LEGACY SOFTWARE is reused to create a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM, the intended use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE might be different from its original intended use. In this case the RISK assessment must take into account the modified set of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS which can arise due to failures of the LEGACY SOFTWARE. – A reused LEGACY SOFTWARE may be used for similar intended use but integrated into a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM.  In this case the RISK assessment should take into account modification of architectural RISK CONTROL measures according to 5.3. When LEGACY SOFTWARE will be changed and used within a new SOFTWARE SYSTEM, the MANUFACTURER should consider how the existing records of safe and reliable operation may be invalidated by the changes. Changes to the LEGACY SOFTWARE should be performed according to Clauses 4 to 9 of this standard, including assessment of impact to RISK CONTROL measures according to 7.4. In the case of LEGACY SOFTWARE, existing RISK CONTROL measures may not be fully documented and special care should be taken to EVALUATE the potential impact of changes, utilizing available documented design records as well as expertise of individuals having knowledge of the system.  Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 46 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  According to 4.4, the MANUFACTURER performs a gap analysis in order to determine the available documentation including objective evidence of performed TASKS done during development of the LEGACY SOFTWARE and compared to 5.2, 5.3, 5.7, and Clause 7. Typical steps to accomplish this gap analysis include a) identification of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, including VERSION, revision and any other means, required for clear identification; b) EVALUATION of existing DELIVERABLES corresponding to the deliverables required by 5.2, 5.3, 5.7, and Clause 7; c) EVALUATION of available objective evidence, documenting the previously applied software development lifecycle model (as appropriate); d) EVALUATION of the adequacy of existing RISK MANAGEMENT documentation, taking ISO 14971 into account. Taking the performed gap analysis into account, the MANUFACTURER will EVALUATE the potential reduction in RISK resulting from the generation of the missing DELIVERABLES and associated ACTIVITIES, and create a plan to perform ACTIVITIES and generate DELIVERABLES to close these gaps. Reduction of RISK should balance the benefit of applying the software development process according to Clause 5 against the possibility that modification of the LEGACY SOFTWARE without full knowledge of its development history could introduce new defects that increase the risk. Some of the elements of Clause 5 may be assessed to have little to no reduction of RISK when done after the fact. For example, detailed design and unit verification reduce RISK primarily during the process of developing new software or refactoring existing software. If these objectives are not planned, performing the ACTIVITIES in isolation may create documentation but lead to no reduction in RISK.   At a minimum, the gap closure plan addresses missing SOFTWARE SYSTEM test records. If these do not exist or are not suitable to support a rationale to continue use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the gap closure plan should include creation of SOFTWARE SYSTEM requirements at a functional level according to 5.2 and tests according to 5.7. The documented rationale for continued use of the LEGACY SOFTWARE builds on the available objective evidence and analysis obtained in the course of assessing the RISK and creating a gap closure plan appropriate for the context of LEGACY SOFTARE reuse. The rationale makes a positive case for the safe and reliable performace of the LEGACY SOFTWARE in the planned reuse context, taking into account both the post-production records available for the LEGACY SOFTWARE and the RISK CONTROL MEASURES affected by filling process gaps. After LEGACY SOFTWARE has been re-used according to 4.4, those parts of the LEGACY SOFTWARE for which gaps in DELIVERABLES remain, continue to be LEGACY SOFTWARE and may be considered for further re-use again according to 4.4. When gaps in deliverables are closed by changing the LEGACY SOFTWARE, the changes should be performed according to Clauses 4 to 9 of this standard. B.5 Software development PROCESS B.5.1 Software development planning The objective of this ACTIVITY is to plan the software development TASKS to reduce RISKS caused by software, communicate procedures and goals to members of the development team, and ensure that SYSTEM quality requirements for the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE are met. The software development planning ACTIVITY can document TASKS in a single plan or in multiple plans. Some MANUFACTURERS might have established policies and procedures that apply to the Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 47 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  development of all their MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE.  In this case the plan can simply reference the existing policies and procedures. Some MANUFACTURERS might prepare a plan or set of plans specific to the development of each MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE that spell out in detail specific ACTIVITIES and reference general procedures. Another possibility is that a plan or set of plans is tailored for the development of each MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. The planning should be specified at the level of detail necessary to carry out the development PROCESS and should be proportional to the RISK. For example, SYSTEMS or items with higher RISK would be subject to a development PROCESS with more rigor and TASKS should be spelled out in greater detail. Planning is an iterative ACTIVITY that should be re-examined and updated as development progresses. The plan can evolve to incorporate more and better information as more is understood about the SYSTEM and the level of effort needed to develop the SYSTEM. For example, a SYSTEM’s initial software safety classification can change as a result of exercising the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and development of the software ARCHITECTURE. Or it might be decided that a SOUP be incorporated into the SYSTEM. It is important that the plan(s) be updated to reflect current knowledge of the SYSTEM and the level of rigor needed for the SYSTEM or items in the SYSTEM to enable proper control over the development PROCESS. B.5.2 Software requirements analysis This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to establish and verify the software requirements for the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Establishing verifiable requirements is essential for determining what is to be built, for determining that the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE exhibits acceptable behaviour, and for demonstrating that the completed MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is ready for use. To demonstrate that the requirements have been implemented as desired, each requirement should be stated in such a way that objective criteria can be established to determine whether it has been implemented correctly.  If the device RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS imposes requirements on the software to control identified RISKS, these requirements are to be identified in the software requirements in such a way as to make it possible to trace the RISK CONTROL measures to the software requirements.  All software requirements should be identified in such a way as to make it possible to demonstrate TRACEABILITY between the requirement and SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing. If regulatory approval in some countries requires conformance to specific regulations or international standards, this conformance requirement should be documented in the software requirements. Because the software requirements establish what is to be implemented in the software, an evaluation of the requirements is required before the requirements analysis ACTIVITY is complete. An area of frequent confusion is the distinction between customer needs, design inputs, software requirements, software functional specifications, and software design specifications. Design inputs are the interpretation of customer needs into formally documented MEDICAL DEVICE requirements. Software requirements are the formally documented specifications of what the software does to meet the customer needs and the design inputs. Software functional specifications are often included with the software requirements and define in detail what the software does to meet its requirements even though many different alternatives might also meet the requirements. Software design specifications define how the software will be designed and decomposed to implement its requirements and functional specifications. Traditionally, software requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications have been written as a set of one or more documents. It is now feasible to consider this information as data items within a common database. Each item would have one or more attributes that would define its purpose and linkage to other items in the database. This approach allows presentation and printing of different views of the information best suited for each set of intended users (e.g., marketing, MANUFACTURERS, testers, auditors) and supports TRACEABILITY to demonstrate adequate implementation and the extent to which test cases test the requirements. Tools to support this approach can be as simple as a hypertext document using HTML hyperlinks or as complex and capable as computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools and requirements analysis tools. The SYSTEM requirements PROCESS is out of scope of this standard. However, the decision to implement MEDICAL DEVICE functionality with software is normally made during SYSTEM design. Some or all of the SYSTEM requirements are allocated to be implemented in software. The Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 48 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  software requirements analysis ACTIVITY consists of analyzing the requirements allocated to software by the SYSTEM requirements PROCESS and deriving a comprehensive set of software requirements that reflect the allocated requirements. To ensure the integrity of the SYSTEM, the MANUFACTURER should provide a mechanism for negotiating changes and clarifications to the SYSTEM requirements to correct impracticalities, inconsistencies or ambiguities in either the parent SYSTEM requirements or the software requirements. The PROCESS of capture and analysis of SYSTEM and software requirements can be iterative. This standard does not intend to require the PROCESSES to be rigidly segregated into two layers. In practice, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and software ARCHITECTURE are often outlined simultaneously and the SYSTEM and software requirements are subsequently documented in a layered form. B.5.3 Software ARCHITECTURAL design This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to define the major structural components of the software and identify their key responsibilities, their externally visible properties, and the relationship among them. If the behaviour of a component can affect other components, that behavior should be described in the software ARCHITECTURE. This description is especially important for behaviour that can affect components of the MEDICAL DEVICE that are outside the software (see 5.3.5 and B.4.3). ARCHITECTURAL decisions are extremely important for implementing RISK CONTROL measures. Without understanding (and documenting) the behaviour of a component that can affect other components, it will be nearly impossible to show that the SYSTEM is safe. A software ARCHITECTURE is necessary to ensure the correct implementation of the software requirements. The software ARCHITECTURE is not complete unless all software requirements can be implemented by the identified SOFTWARE ITEMS. Because the design and implementation of the software is dependent on the ARCHITECTURE, the ARCHITECTURE is VERIFIED to complete this ACTIVITY. VERIFICATION of the ARCHITECTURE is generally done by technical EVALUATION. The software safety classification of SOFTWARE ITEMS during the software ARCHITECTURE ACTIVITY creates a basis for the subsequent choice of software PROCESSES. The records of classification are placed under change control as part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Many subsequent events might invalidate the classification. These include, for example: – changes of SYSTEM specification, software specification or ARCHITECTURE; – discovery of errors in the RISK ANALYSIS, especially unforeseen HAZARDS; and – discovery of the infeasibility of a requirement, especially a RISK CONTROL measure; Therefore, during all ACTIVITIES following the design of the software ARCHITECTURE, the classification of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and SOFTWARE ITEMS should be re-EVALUATED and might need to be revised. This would trigger rework to apply additional PROCESSES to a SOFTWARE ITEM as a result of its upgrading to a higher class. The software configuration management PROCESS (Clause 8) is used to ensure that all necessary rework is identified and completed. B.5.4 Software detailed design This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to refine the SOFTWARE ITEMS and interfaces defined in the ARCHITECTURE to create SOFTWARE UNITS and their interfaces. Although SOFTWARE UNITS are often thought of as being a single function or module, this view is not always appropriate. This standard has defined SOFTWARE UNIT to be a SOFTWARE ITEM that is not subdivided into smaller items. SOFTWARE UNITS can be tested separately. The MANUFACTURER should define the level of detail of the SOFTWARE UNIT. Detailed design specifies algorithms, data representations, interfaces among different SOFTWARE UNITS, and interfaces between SOFTWARE UNITS and data structures. Detailed design must also be concerned with the packaging of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. It is necessary to define the design of the SOFTWARE UNITS and the interfaces in sufficient detail to permit its SAFETY and effectiveness to be objectively VERIFIED where this can be ensured using other requirements or design documentation. It should be complete enough Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 49 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  that the programmer is not required to make ad hoc design decisions. Detailed design must also be concerned with the architecture of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. A SOFTWARE ITEM can be decomposed so that only a few of the new SOFTWARE ITEMS implement the SAFETY-related requirement of the original SOFTWARE ITEM. The remaining SOFTWARE ITEMS do not implement SAFETY-related functions and can be reclassified into a lower software safety class. However, the decision to do this is in itself part of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, and is documented in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Because implementation depends on detailed design, it is necessary to verify the detailed design before the ACTIVITY is complete. VERIFICATION of detailed design is generally done by a technical EVALUATION. Subclause 5.4.4 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the outputs of the detailed design ACTIVITIES. The design specifies how the requirements are to be implemented. VERIFICATION of the design provides assurance that it implements the software ARCHITECTURE and is free from contradiction with the software ARCHITECTURE. If the design contains defects, the code will not implement the requirements correctly. When present in the design, the MANUFACTURER should verify design characteristics which the MANUFACTURER believes are important for SAFETY. Examples of these characteristics include: – implementation of the intended events, inputs, outputs, interfaces, logic flow, allocation of CPU, allocation of memory resources, error and exception definition, error and exception isolation, and error recovery; – definition of the default state, in which all faults that can result in a hazardous situation are addressed, with events and transitions; – initialization of variables, memory management; and – cold and warm resets, standby, and other state changes that can affect the RISK CONTROL measures. B.5.5 SOFTWARE UNIT implementation and verification This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to write and verify the code for the SOFTWARE UNITS. The detailed design is to be translated into source code. Coding represents the point where decomposition of the specifications ends and composition of the executable software begins. To consistently achieve the desirable code characteristics, coding standards should be used to specify a preferred coding style. Examples of coding standards include requirements for understandability, language usage rules or restrictions, and complexity management. The code for each unit is VERIFIED to ensure that it functions as specified by the detailed design and that it complies with the specified coding standards. Subclause 5.5.5 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the code. If the code does not implement the design correctly, the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE will not perform as intended. B.5.6 Software integration and integration testing This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to plan and execute integration of SOFTWARE UNITS into aggregate SOFTWARE ITEMS as well as integration of SOFTWARE ITEMS into higher aggregated SOFTWARE ITEMS and to verify that the resulting SOFTWARE ITEMS behave as intended. The approach to integration can range from non-incremental integration to any form of incremental integration. The properties of the SOFTWARE ITEM being assembled dictate the chosen method of integration. Software integration testing focuses on the transfer of data and control across a SOFTWARE ITEM’s internal and external interfaces. External interfaces are those with other software, including operating system software, and MEDICAL DEVICE hardware. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 50 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  The rigor of integration testing and the level of detail of the documentation associated with integration testing should be commensurate with the RISK associated with the device, the device’s dependence on software for potentially hazardous functions, and the role of specific SOFTWARE ITEMS in higher RISK device functions. For example, although all SOFTWARE ITEMS should be tested, items that have an effect on SAFETY should be subject to more direct, thorough, and detailed tests. As applicable, integration testing demonstrates program behaviour at the boundaries of its input and output domains and confirms program responses to invalid, unexpected, and special inputs. The program’s actions are revealed when given combinations of inputs or unexpected sequences of inputs, or when defined timing requirements are violated. The test requirements in the plan should include, as appropriate, the types of white box testing to be performed as part of integration testing. White box testing, also known as glass box, structural, clear box and open box testing, is a testing technique where explicit knowledge of the internal workings of the SOFTWARE ITEM being tested are used to select the test data. White box testing uses specific knowledge of the SOFTWARE ITEM to examine outputs. The test is accurate only if the tester knows what the SOFTWARE ITEM is supposed to do. The tester can then see if the SOFTWARE ITEM diverges from its intended goal. White box testing cannot guarantee that the complete specification has been implemented since it is focused on testing the implementation of the SOFTWARE ITEM. Black box testing, also known as behavioural, functional, opaque-box, and closed-box testing, is focused on testing the functional specification and it cannot guarantee that all parts of the implementation have been tested. Thus black box testing is testing against the specification and will discover faults of omission, indicating that part of the specification has not been fulfilled. White box testing is testing against the implementation and will discover faults of commission, indicating that part of the implementation is faulty. In order to fully test MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE both black and white box testing might be required. The plans and test documentation identified in 5.6 and 5.7 can be individual documents tied to specific phases of development or evolutionary prototypes. They also might be combined so a single document or set of documents covers the requirements of multiple subsections. All or portions of the documents could be incorporated into higher level project documents such as a software or project quality assurance plan or a comprehensive test plan that addresses all aspects of testing for hardware and software. In these cases, a cross reference should be created that identifies how the various project documents relate to each of the software integration TASKS. Software integration testing can be performed in a simulated environment, on actual target hardware, or on the full MEDICAL DEVICE. Subclause 5.6.2 requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the output of the software integration ACTIVITY.  The output of the software integration ACTIVITY is the integrated SOFTWARE ITEMS. These integrated SOFTWARE ITEMS must function properly for the entire MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE to function correctly and safely. B.5.7 SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the software’s functionality by verifying that the requirements for the software have been successfully implemented. SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing demonstrates that the specified functionality exists. This testing VERIFIES the functionality and performance of the program as built with respect to the requirements for the software. SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing focuses on functional (black box) testing, although it might be desirable to use white box (see previous section) methods to more efficiently accomplish certain tests, initiate stress conditions or faults, or increase code coverage of the qualification tests. The organization of testing by types and test stage is flexible, but coverage of Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---IEC 62304:2006 – 51 – +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  requirements, RISK CONTROL, usability, and test types (e.g., fault, installation, stress) should be demonstrated and documented. SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing tests the integrated software and can be performed in a simulated environment, on actual target hardware, or on the full MEDICAL DEVICE. When a change is made to a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (even a small change), the degree of REGRESSION TESTING (not just the testing of the individual change) should be determined to ensure that no unintended side effects have been introduced. This REGRESSION TESTING (and the rationale for not fully repeating SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing) should be planned and documented. (See B.6.3). SOFTWARE SYSTEM test responsibilities can be dispersed, occurring at different locations and being conducted by different organizations. However, regardless of the distribution of TASKS, contractual relations, source of components, or development environment, the device MANUFACTURER retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the software functions properly for its intended use. If ANOMALIES uncovered during testing can be repeated, but a decision has been made not to fix them, then these ANOMALIES need to be EVALUATED in relation to the RISK analysis to verify that they do not affect the SAFETY of the device. The root cause and symptoms of the ANOMALIES should be understood, and the rationale for not fixing them should be documented. Subclause 5.7.4 requires the results of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing be EVALUATED to ensure that the expected results were obtained. B.5.8 Software release This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to document the VERSION of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE being released, specify how it was created, and follow appropriate procedures for release of the software.  The MANUFACTURER should be able to show that the software that was developed using the development PROCESS is the software that is being released. The MANUFACTURER should also be able to retrieve the software and the tools used for its generation in case it is needed in the future and should store, package, and deliver the software in a manner that minimizes the software from being damaged or misused. Defined procedures should be established to ensure that these TASKS are performed appropriately and with consistent results. B.6 Software maintenance PROCESS B.6.1 Establish software maintenance plan The software maintenance PROCESS differs from the software development PROCESS in two ways: – The MANUFACTURER is permitted to use a smaller PROCESS than the full software development PROCESS to implement rapid changes in response to urgent problems. – In responding to software PROBLEMS REPORTS relating to released product, the MANUFACTURER not only addresses the problem but also satisfies local regulations (typically by running a pro-active surveillance scheme for collecting problem data from the field and communicating with users and regulators about the problem). Subclause 6.1 requires these PROCESSES to be established in a maintenance plan. This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to create or identify procedures for implementing maintenance ACTIVITIES and TASKS. To implement corrective actions, control changes during maintenance, and manage release of revised software, the MANUFACTURER should document and resolve reported problems and requests from users, as well as manage modifications to Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 52 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. This PROCESS is activated when the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE undergoes modifications to code and associated documentation because of either a problem or the need for improvement or adaptation. The objective is to modify released MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE while preserving its integrity.  This PROCESS includes migration of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE to environments or platforms for which it was not originally released. The ACTIVITIES provided in this clause are specific to the maintenance PROCESS; however, the maintenance PROCESS might use other PROCESSES in this standard. The MANUFACTURER needs to plan how the ACTIVITIES and TASKS of the maintenance PROCESS will be performed. B.6.2 Problem and modification analysis  This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to analyze feedback for its effect; verify reported problems; and consider, select, and obtain approval for implementing a modification option. Problems and other requests for changes can affect the performance, SAFETY, or regulatory clearance of a MEDICAL DEVICE. An analysis is necessary to determine whether any effects exist because of a PROBLEM REPORT or whether any effects will result from a modification to correct a problem or implement a request. It is especially important to verify through trace or regression analysis that the RISK CONTROL measures built into the device are not adversely changed or modified by the software change that is being implemented as part of the software maintenance ACTIVITY. It is also important to verify that the modified software does not cause a HAZARDOUS SITUATION or mitigate a RISK in software that previously did not cause a HAZARDOUS SITUATION or mitigate RISKS. The software safety classification of a SOFTWARE ITEM might have changed if the software modification now can cause a HAZARD or mitigate a RISK. It is important to distinguish between software maintenance (Clause 6) and software problem resolution (Clause 9). The focus of the software maintenance PROCESS is an adequate response to feedback arising after release of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. As part of a MEDICAL DEVICE, the software maintenance PROCESS needs to ensure that: – SAFETY-related PROBLEM REPORTS are addressed and reported to appropriate regulatory authorities and affected users; – MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is re-validated and re-released after modification with formal controls that ensure the rectification of the problem and the avoidance of further problems; – the MANUFACTURER considers what other MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE might be affected and takes appropriate action. The focus of software problem resolution is the operation of a comprehensive control system that: • analyses PROBLEM REPORTS and identifies all the implications of the problem; • decides on a number of changes and identifies all their side-effects; • implements the changes while maintaining the consistency of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS including the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE; • VERIFIES the implementation of the changes. The software maintenance PROCESS uses the software problem resolution PROCESS. The software maintenance PROCESS handles the high-level decisions about the PROBLEM REPORT (whether a problem exists, whether it has a significant effect on SAFETY, what changes are needed and when to implement them), and uses the software problem resolution PROCESS to analyse the PROBLEM REPORT to discover all the implications and to generate possible CHANGE REQUESTS which identify all the CONFIGURATION ITEMS that need to be changed and all the VERIFICATION steps that are necessary.

If a maintenance PROCESS has not been defined, the appropriate development PROCESS TASKS can be used to make the modification. The MANUFACTURER should also ensure that the modification does not cause a negative effect on other parts of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Unless the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is treated as a new development, analysis of the effect of a modification on the entire MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is necessary. Regression analysis and testing are employed to provide assurance that a change has not created problems elsewhere in the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Regression analysis is the determination of the impact of a change based on review of the relevant documentation (e.g., software requirements specification, software design specification, source code, test plans, test cases, test scripts, etc.) in order to identify the necessary regression tests to be run. Regression testing is the rerunning of test cases that a program has previously executed correctly and comparing the current result to the previous result in order to detect unintended effects of a software change. A rationale must be made that justifies the amount of REGRESSION TESTING that will be performed to ensure that the portions of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE not being modified still perform as they did before the modification was made. B.7 Software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Software RISK MANAGEMENT is a part of overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT and cannot be adequately addressed in isolation. This standard requires the use of a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS that is compliant with ISO 14971. RISK MANAGEMENT as defined in ISO 14971 deals specifically with a framework for effective management of the RISKS associated with the use of MEDICAL DEVICES. One portion of ISO 14971 pertains to control of identified RISKS associated with each HAZARD identified during the RISK ANALYSIS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this standard is intended to provide additional requirements for RISK CONTROL for software, including software that has been identified during the RISK ANALYSIS as potentially contributing to a hazardous situation, or software that is used to control MEDICAL DEVICE RISKS. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS is included in this standard for two reasons. a) the intended audience of this standard needs to understand minimum requirements for RISK CONTROL measures in their area of responsibility—software; b) the general RISK MANAGEMENT standard, ISO 14971, provided as a normative reference in this standard, does not specifically address the RISK CONTROL of software and the placement of RISK CONTROL in the software development life cycle. Software RISK MANAGEMENT is a part of overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT. Plans, procedures, and documentation required for the software RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES can be a series of separate documents or a single document, or they can be integrated with the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES and documentation as long as all requirements in this standard are met. B.7.1 Analysis of software contributing to hazardous situations It is expected that the device HAZARD analysis will identify hazardous situations and corresponding RISK CONTROL measures to reduce the probability and/or severity of those hazardous situations to an acceptable level. It is also expected that the RISK CONTROL measures will be assigned to software functions that are expected to implement those RISK CONTROL measures.

At that time it is known how software functions will be implemented in software components, and the practicality of the RISK CONTROL measures assigned to software functions can be EVALUATED. At that time the device HAZARD analysis should be revised to include: • revised hazardous situations; • revised RISK CONTROL measures and software requirements; • new hazardous situations arising from software, for example hazardous situations related to human factors. The software ARCHITECTURE should include credible strategies for segregating software components so that they do not interact in unsafe ways. B.8 Software configuration management PROCESS The software configuration management PROCESS is a PROCESS of applying administrative and technical procedures throughout the software life cycle to identify and define SOFTWARE ITEMS, including documentation, in a SYSTEM; control modifications and releases of the items; and document and report the status of the items and CHANGE REQUESTS. Software configuration management is necessary to recreate a SOFTWARE ITEM, to identify its constituent parts, and to provide a history of the changes that have been made to it. B.8.1 Configuration identification This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to uniquely identify software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and their VERSIONS. This identification is necessary to identify the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and the VERSIONS that are included in the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. B.8.2 Change control This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to control changes of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and to document information identifying CHANGE REQUESTS and providing documentation about their disposition. This ACTIVITY is necessary to ensure that unauthorized or unintended changes are not made to the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS and to ensure that approved CHANGE REQUESTS are implemented fully and verified. CHANGE REQUESTS can be approved by a change control board or by a manager or technical lead according to the software configuration management plan. Approved CHANGE REQUESTS are made traceable to the actual modification and VERIFICATION of the software. The requirement is that each actual change be linked to a CHANGE REQUEST and that documentation exists to show that the CHANGE REQUEST was approved. The documentation might be change control board minutes, an approval signature, or a record in a database. B.8.3 Configuration status accounting  This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to maintain records of the history of the software CONFIGURATION ITEMS. This ACTIVITY is necessary to determine when and why changes were made.  Access to this information is necessary to ensure that software CONFIGURATION ITEMS contain only authorized modifications. B.9 Software problem resolution PROCESS The software problem resolution PROCESS is a PROCESS for analyzing and resolving the problems (including non-conformances), whatever their nature or source, including those discovered during the execution of development, maintenance, or other PROCESSES. The objective is to provide a timely, responsible, and documented means to ensure that discovered problems are analyzed and resolved and that trends are recognized.

It is called “problem resolution” in ISO/IEC 12207 [9] and IEC 60601-1-4 [2], Amendment 1. We have chosen to call it “software problem resolution” in this standard. This ACTIVITY requires that the MANUFACTURER use the software problem resolution PROCESS when a problem or non-conformance is identified. This ACTIVITY is necessary to ensure that discovered problems are analyzed and EVALUATED for possible relevance to SAFETY (as specified in ISO 14971). Software development plan(s) or procedures, as required in 5.1, are to address how problems or non-conformances will be handled. This includes specifying at each stage of the life cycle the aspects of the software problem resolution PROCESS that will be formal and documented as well as when problems and nonconformities are to be entered into the software problem resolution PROCESS.

The software is considered a subsystem of the MEDICAL DEVICE or is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE. This standard is to be used together with other appropriate standards when developing a MEDICAL DEVICE. MEDICAL DEVICE management standards such as ISO 13485 [8] (see C.2 and Annex D) and ISO 14971 (see Annex C.3) provide a management environment that lays a foundation for an organization to develop products. Safety standards such as IEC 60601-1 [1] (see Annex C.4) and IEC 61010-1 [5] (see Annex C.5) give specific direction for creating safe MEDICAL DEVICES. When software is a part of these MEDICAL DEVICES, IEC 62304 provides more detailed direction on what is required to develop and maintain safe MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. Many other standards such as ISO/IEC 12207 [9] (see Annex C.6), IEC 61508-3 [4] (see Annex C.7) and ISO/IEC 90003 [15] can be looked to as a source of methods, tools and techniques that can be used to implement the requirements in IEC 62304. Figure C.1 shows the relationship of these standards. Where clauses or requirements from other standards are quoted, defined terms in the quoted items are terms that are defined in the other standard, not defined terms in this standard.

This standard identifies requirements for software which are in addition to, but not incompatible with, the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005 /AMD1:2012 [1] for PEMS. Because PEMS include elements that are not software, not all of the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 for PEMS are addressed in this standard. With the publication of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005 /AMD1:2012, IEC 62304 is now a normative reference of IEC 60601-1 and compliance with Clause 14 of IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 (and thus compliance with the standard) requires compliance with parts of IEC 62304 (not with the whole of IEC 62304 because IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 does not require compliance with post-production and maintenance requirements of IEC 62304). Finally, it is important to remember that IEC 60601-1:2005 + IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 is only used if the software is part of a PEMS and not if the software is itself a MEDICAL DEVICE. C.4.2 Software relationship to PEMS development By using the V-model illustrated in Figure C.2 to describe what occurs during a PEMS development, it can be seen that the requirements of this software standard apply at the PEMS component level, from the specification of the software requirements to the integration of the SOFTWARE ITEMS into a SOFTWARE SYSTEM. This SOFTWARE SYSTEM is a part of a programmable electrical subsystem (PESS), which is a part of a PEMS.

These requirements relate to the PEMS requirements in IEC 60601-1 for development life cycle, requirement specification, ARCHITECTURE, design and implementation, and VERIFICATION. The requirements in this standard provide greater detail about software development than those in IEC 60601-1. C.4.4 Maintenance PROCESS Compliance with the software maintenance PROCESS of this standard (Clause 6) requires that procedures be established and followed when changes to software are made. These require-ments correspond to the requirement in IEC 60601-1 for modification of a PEMS. The requirements in this standard for software maintenance provide greater detail about what must be done for software maintenance than the requirements for PEMS modification in IEC 60601-1. C.4.5 Other PROCESSES The other PROCESSES in this standard specify additional requirements for software beyond the similar requirements for PEMS in IEC 60601-1. In most cases, there is a general requirement for PEMS in IEC 60601-1, which the PROCESSES in this standard expand upon. The software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS in this standard corresponds to the additional RISK MANAGEMENT requirements identified for PEMS in IEC 60601-1.

The requirements in 14.13 are applicable to any PEMS intended to be incorporated into an  IT-NETWORK whether or not the requirements in 14.2 to 14.12 apply. When the requirements in 14.2 to 14.13 apply, the requirements in subclause 4.3, Clause 5, Clause 7, Clause 8 and Clause 9 of IEC 62304:2006 shall also apply to the development or modification of software for each PESS. 4.3 Software safety classification The PEMS requirements of IEC 60601-1 would only apply to software safety classes B and C. This standard includes some requirements for software safety class A.           The software development PROCESS required for compliance with IEC 60601-1 does not include the post production monitoring and maintenance required by Clause 6 of IEC 62304:2006. 14.2 Documentation The documents required by Clause 14 shall be reviewed, approved, issued and changed in accordance with a formal document control procedure. 5.1 Software development planning In addition to the specific requirements in the software development planning ACTIVITY, documents that are part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE are required to be maintained by ISO 14971. In addition, for documents that are required by the quality system, ISO 13485 [8] requires control of the documents. 14.3 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN The RISK MANAGEMENT plan required by 4.2.2 shall also include a reference to the PEMS VALIDATION plan (see 14.11).  Not specifically required. There is no specific software validation plan. The PEMS validation plan is at the SYSTEM level and thus is outside the scope of this software standard.  This standard does require TRACEABILITY from HAZARD to specific software cause to RISK CONTROL measure to VERIFICATION of the RISK CONTROL measure (see 7.3)  14.4 PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE A PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall be documented. 5.1 Software development planning 5.1.1 Software development plan The items addressed by the software development plan constitute a SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE. The PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall contain a set of defined milestones.  At each milestone, the ACTIVITIES to be completed and the VERIFICATION methods to be applied to those activities shall be defined. 5.1.6 Software VERIFICATION planning  VERIFICATION TASKS, milestones and acceptance criteria must be planned. Each activity shall be defined including its inputs and outputs. 5.1.1 Software development plan ACTIVITIES are defined in this standard.  Documentation to be produced is defined in each ACTIVITY. Each milestone shall identify the RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES that must be completed before that milestone.  The PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE shall be tailored for a specific development by making plans which detail ACTIVITIES, milestones and schedules. 5.1.1 Software development plan This standard allows the development life cycle to be documented in the development plan. This means the development plan contains a tailored development life cycle.

These tools and PROCEDURES shall be appropriate to assure that each RISK CONTROL measure satisfactorily reduces the identified RISK(S). 5.1.4 Software development standards, methods and tools planning  This standard requires the identification of specific tools and methods to be used for development in general, not for each RISK CONTROL measure.   14.7 Requirements specification  For the PEMS and each of its subsystems (e.g. for a PESS) there shall be a documented requirement specification. 5.2 Software requirements analysis  This standard deals only with the software subsystems of a PEMS. The requirement specification for a system or subsystem shall include and distinguish any ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE and any RISK CONTROL measures implemented by that system or subsystem. 5.2.1 Define and document software requirements from SYSTEM requirements.  5.2.2 Software requirements content 5.2.3 Include RISK CONTROL measures in software requirements This standard does not require that the requirements related to essential performance and RISK CONTROL measures be distinguished from other requirements, but it does require that all requirements be uniquely identified.

C.4.7 Relationship to requirements in IEC 60601-1-4 IEC 60601-1-4 has been withdrawn. C.5 Relationship to IEC 61010-1 The scope of IEC 61010-1 [5] covers electrical test and measuring equipment, electrical control equipment and electrical laboratory equipment. Only part of the laboratory equipment is used in a medical environment or as in vitro diagnostic equipment (IVD).  Due to legal regulations or normative references, IVD equipment is allocated to MEDICAL DEVICES without, however, falling within the scope of IEC 60601-1 [1]. This is attributable not only to the fact that, strictly speaking, IVD instruments are not MEDICAL DEVICES which come into direct contact with patients, but also to the fact that such products are manufactured for many different applications in various laboratories. Use as an IVD instrument or as an accessory for an IVD instrument is then rare. If laboratory equipment is used as IVD equipment, the measured results obtained must be EVALUATED in accordance with medical criteria. The application of ISO 14971 is required for RISK MANAGEMENT. If such products also contain software that can lead to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, for example failure caused by the software which results in an unwanted change of medical data (measuring results), IEC 62304 must be taken into account. IEC 61010-1:2010 has a general requirement for risk assessment in Clause 17, which is more streamlined than the full risk management requirements of ISO 14971. Applying IEC 61010-1 Clause 17 alone does not meet the required criteria for risk management of IEC 62304, which is based on full ISO 14971 risk management requirements. With this in mind, it is expected by this standard that when an IVD medical device has software-related risks, its risk management process is performed following ISO 14971 instead of only Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1. Compliance with Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1 will be achieved, as detailed in the Note to Clause 17 of IEC 61010-1: NOTE One RISK assessment procedure is outlined in Annex J. Other RISK assessment procedures are contained in ISO 14971, SEMI S10-1296, IEC 61508, ISO 14121-1, and ANSI B11.TR3. Other established procedures which implement similar steps can also be used.

This standard differs from ISO/IEC 12207 mainly with respect to the following. It: • excludes SYSTEM aspects, such as SYSTEM requirements, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE and validation; • omits some PROCESSES seen as duplicating ACTIVITIES documented elsewhere for MEDICAL DEVICES; • adds the (SAFETY) RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and the software release PROCESS; • incorporates the documentation and the VERIFICATION supporting PROCESSES into the development and maintenance PROCESSES; • merges the PROCESS implementation and planning ACTIVITIES of each PROCESS into a single ACTIVITY in the development and maintenance PROCESSES; • classifies the requirements with respect to SAFETY needs; and • does not explicitly classify PROCESSES as primary or supporting, nor group PROCESSES as ISO/IEC 12207 does. Most of these changes were driven by the desire to tailor the standard to the need of the MEDICAL DEVICE sector by: • focusing on SAFETY aspects and the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT standard ISO 14971; • selecting the appropriate PROCESSES useful in a regulated environment; • taking into account that software development is embedded in a quality system (which covers some of the PROCESSES and requirements of ISO/IEC 12207); and • lowering the level of abstraction to make it easier to use. This standard is not contradictory to ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/IEC 12207 can be useful as an aide in setting up a well structured SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL that includes the requirements of this standard.

The approach to safety in IEC 62304 is fundamentally different than the one in IEC 61508. IEC 62304 takes into account that the effectiveness of medical devices justifies residual risks related to their use. The following explains the stance of this standard.  IEC 61508 addresses 3 main issues: 1) RISK MANAGEMENT life cycle and life cycle PROCESSES; 2) definition of Safety Integrity Levels; 3) recommendation of techniques, tools and methods for software development and levels of independence of personnel responsible for performing different TASKS. Issue 1) is covered in this standard by a normative reference to ISO 14971 (the MEDICAL DEVICE sector standard for RISK MANAGEMENT). The effect of this reference is to adopt ISO 14971’s approach to RISK MANAGEMENT as an integral part of the software PROCESS for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. For issue 2), this standard takes a simpler approach than IEC 61508. The latter classifies software into 4 “Safety Integrity Levels” defined in terms of reliability objectives. The reliability objectives are identified after RISK ANALYSIS, which quantifies both the severity and the probability of HARM caused by a failure of the software. This standard simplifies issue 2) by defining the classification into 3 software safety classes based on the RISK caused by a failure.  After classification, different PROCESSES are required for different software safety classes: the intention is to further reduce the probability (and/or the severity) of failure of the software. Issue 3) is not addressed by this standard. Readers of the standard are encouraged to use IEC 61508 as a source for good software methods, techniques and tools, while recognising Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 01/30/2017 10:06:16 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,````,,`,``,`,````,,`,``,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 74 – IEC 62304:2006    +AMD1:2015 CSV  IEC 2015  that other approaches, both present and future, can provide equally good results. This standard makes no recommendation concerning independence of people responsible for one software ACTIVITY (for example VERIFICATION) from those responsible for another (for example design). In particular, this standard makes no requirement for an independent safety assessor, since this is a matter for ISO 14971.

It also considers that other standards like ISO 13485 [8] require adequate and comparable PROCESSES. D.2 Quality management system For MANUFACTURERS of MEDICAL DEVICES, including MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE in the context of this standard, the establishment of a quality management system (QMS) is required in 4.1. This standard does not require that the QMS necessarily has to be certified. D.3 EVALUATE quality management PROCESSES It is recommended to EVALUATE how well the established and documented PROCESSES of the QMS already cover the PROCESSES of the software life cycle, by means of audits, inspections, or analyses under the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER.  Any identified gaps can be accommodated by extending the QM PROCESSES, or can be separately described. If the MANUFACTURER already has PROCESS descriptions available which regulate the development, VERIFICATION and validation of software, then these should also be EVALUATED to determine how well they agree with this standard. D.4 Integrating requirements of this standard into the MANUFACTURER’S quality management PROCESSES This standard can be implemented by adapting or extending the PROCESSES already installed in the QMS system, or integrating new PROCESSES. This standard does not specify how this is to be done; the MANUFACTURER is free to do this in any suitable way. The MANUFACTURER is responsible for ensuring that the PROCESSES described in this standard are suitably put into action when the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is developed by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or sub-contractors not having their own documented QMS. D.5 Checklist for small MANUFACTURERS without a certified QMS The MANUFACTURER should determine the highest software safety classification (A, B or C) of the software. Table D.1 lists all ACTIVITIES described in this standard. The reference to ISO 13485 should help to define the place in the QMS. Based on the required software safety class, the MANUFACTURER should assess each required ACTIVITY against the existing PROCESSES. If the requirement is already covered, a reference to the relevant PROCESS descriptions should be given. If there is discrepancy, an action is needed to improve the PROCESS.

ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.                            Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                    A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ PAGE iii Authority This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347.  NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.  This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.  Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130, Appendix III. Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority.  Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.  This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.  Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.    NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 1, 93 pages  (February 2010)                        National Institute of Standards and Technology Attn: Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory 100 Bureau Drive (Mail Stop 8930) Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8930 Electronic mail: sec-cert@nist.gov  Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately.  Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.  There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities.  The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications.  Thus, until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative.  For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new publications by NIST.   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback to NIST.  All NIST publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                    A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ PAGE iv Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to federal information systems.  The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of federal information systems.  Standards prescribed shall include information security standards that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve the security of federal information and information systems.  • Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA.  FIPS are compulsory and binding for federal agencies.2  FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use. • Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and guidance documents.  For other than national security programs and systems, federal agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information Processing Standard.  FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as amended.  In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications.3 • Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities.  These publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB. • Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by OMB in policies, directives, or memoranda (e.g., annual FISMA Reporting Guidance).                                                   1 The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States.  Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets. 2 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy. 3 While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance.  Federal agencies apply the security concepts and principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions, business functions, and environment of operation.  Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems.  Given the high priority of information sharing and transparency within the federal government, agencies also consider reciprocity in developing their information security solutions.  When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators, auditors, and assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business responsibilities, operational environment, and unique organizational conditions. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                    A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ PAGE v Acknowledgements This publication was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group with representatives from the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities in an ongoing effort to produce a unified information security framework for the federal government.

In addition to its comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal government.  A common foundation for information security will provide the Intelligence, Defense, and Civil sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more uniform and consistent ways to manage the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation that results from the operation and use of information systems.  A common foundation for information security will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of security authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing.  NIST is also working with public and private sector entities to establish specific mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001, Information Security Management System (ISMS).  Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                    A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ PAGE vii  Table of Contents CHAPTER ONE   INTRODUCTION .......................................................................................... 1 1.1   BACKGROUND ........................................................................................................................ 1 1.2   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY .................................................................................................. 2 1.3   TARGET AUDIENCE .................................................................................................................. 3 1.4   ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION .......................................................................... 4 CHAPTER TWO   THE FUNDAMENTALS .................................................................................. 5 2.1   INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT .............................................................. 5 2.2   SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE ......................................................................................... 9 2.3   INFORMATION SYSTEM BOUNDARIES ...................................................................................... 10 2.4   SECURITY CONTROL ALLOCATION .......................................................................................... 16 CHAPTER THREE   THE PROCESS ...................................................................................... 18 3.1   RMF STEP 1 – CATEGORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM ................................................................. 21 3.2   RMF STEP 2 – SELECT SECURITY CONTROLS .......................................................................... 24 3.3   RMF STEP 3 – IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS ..................................................................... 28 3.4   RMF STEP 4 – ASSESS SECURITY CONTROLS .......................................................................... 30 3.5   RMF STEP 5 – AUTHORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM ................................................................... 34 3.6   RMF STEP 6 – MONITOR SECURITY CONTROLS ........................................................................ 38 APPENDIX A   REFERENCES ............................................................................................

Information systems can include as constituent components, a range of diverse computing platforms from high-end supercomputers to personal digital assistants and cellular telephones.  Information systems can also include very specialized systems and devices (e.g., telecommunications systems, industrial/process control systems, testing and calibration devices, weapons systems, command and control systems, and environmental control systems).  Federal information and information systems6 are subject to serious threats that can have adverse impacts on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation7 by compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.  Threats to information and information systems include environmental disruptions, human or machine errors, and purposeful attacks.  Cyber attacks on information systems today are often aggressive, disciplined, well-organized, well-funded, and in a growing number of documented cases, very sophisticated.  Successful attacks on public and private sector information systems can result in serious or grave damage to the national and economic security interests of the United States.  Given the significant and growing danger of these threats, it is imperative that leaders at all levels of an organization understand their responsibilities for achieving adequate information security and for managing information system-related security risks.8 1.1   BACKGROUND NIST in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), has developed a common information security framework for the federal government and its contractors.  The intent of this common framework is to improve information security, strengthen risk management processes, and encourage reciprocity among federal agencies.  This publication, developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group, transforms the traditional Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process into the six-step Risk Management Framework (RMF).  The revised process emphasizes: (i) building information security capabilities into federal information systems through the application of state-of-the-practice management, operational, and technical security controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the                                                  4 The term organization is used in this publication to describe an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements). 5 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. 6 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. 7 Adverse impacts to the Nation include, for example, compromises to information systems that support critical infrastructure applications or are paramount to government continuity of operations as defined by the Department of Homeland Security. 8 Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. O Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 1  PAGE 2 security state of information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring processes; and (iii) providing essential information to senior leaders to facilitate decisions regarding the acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the operation and use of information systems. The RMF has the following characteristics: • Promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes; • Encourages the use of automation to provide senior leaders the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information systems supporting their core missions and business functions; • Integrates information security into the enterprise architecture and system development life cycle; • Provides emphasis on the selection, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of security controls, and the authorization of information systems; • Links risk management processes at the information system level to risk management processes at the organization level through a risk executive (function); and • Establishes responsibility and accountability for security controls deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls). The risk management process described in this publication changes the traditional focus of C&A as a static, procedural activity to a more dynamic approach that provides the capability to more effectively manage information system-related security risks in highly diverse environments of complex and sophisticated cyber threats, ever-increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly changing missions. 1.2   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework to federal information systems to include conducting the activities of security categorization,9 security control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization,10 and security control monitoring.  The guidelines have been developed: • To ensure that managing information system-related security risks is consistent with the organization’s mission/business objectives and overall risk strategy established by the senior leadership through the risk executive (function); • To ensure that information security requirements, including necessary security controls, are integrated into the organization’s enterprise architecture and system development life cycle processes;                                                  9 FIPS 199 provides security categorization guidance for nonnational security systems.  CNSS Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national security systems. 10 Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 1  PAGE 3 • To support consistent, well-informed, and ongoing security authorization decisions (through continuous monitoring), transparency of security and risk management-related information, and reciprocity;11 and • To achieve more secure information and information systems within the federal government through the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies. This publication satisfies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information security requirements established for executive agencies12 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources.  The guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542.  The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.  State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.13 1.3   TARGET AUDIENCE This publication serves individuals associated with the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and disposition of federal information systems including: • Individuals with mission/business ownership responsibilities or fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., heads of federal agencies, chief executive officers, chief financial officers); • Individuals with information system development and integration responsibilities (e.g., program managers, information technology product developers, information system developers, information systems integrators, enterprise architects, information security architects); • Individuals with information system and/or security management/oversight responsibilities (e.g., senior leaders, risk executives, authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers14);                                                  11 Reciprocity is the mutual agreement among participating organizations to accept each other’s security assessments in order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept each other’s assessed security posture in order to share information.  Reciprocity is best achieved by promoting the concept of transparency (i.e., making sufficient evidence regarding the security state of an information system available, so that an authorizing official from another organization can use that evidence to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding the operation and use of that system or the information it processes, stores, or transmits). 12 An executive agency is: (i) an executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 101; (ii) a military department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 102; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1); and (iv) a wholly owned government corporation fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91.  In this publication, the term executive agency is synonymous with the term federal agency. 13 In accordance with the provisions of FISMA and OMB policy, whenever the interconnection of federal information systems to information systems operated by state/local/tribal governments, contractors, or grantees involves the processing, storage, or transmission of federal information, the information security standards and guidelines described in this publication apply.  Specific information security requirements and the terms and conditions of the system interconnections, are expressed in the Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnection Security Agreements established by participating organizations. 14 At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer.  Organizations also refer to this position as the Chief Information Security Officer. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 1  PAGE 4 • Individuals with information system and security control assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., system evaluators, assessors/assessment teams, independent verification and validation assessors, auditors, or information system owners); and • Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g., information system owners, common control providers, information owners/stewards, mission/business owners, information security architects, information system security engineers/officers). 1.4   ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows: • Chapter Two describes the fundamental concepts associated with managing information system-related security risks including: (i) an organization-wide view of risk management and the application of the Risk Management Framework; (ii) the integration of information security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iii) the establishment of information system boundaries; and (iv) the allocation of security controls to organizational information systems as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls. • Chapter Three describes the tasks required to apply the Risk Management Framework to information systems including: (i) the categorization of information and information systems; (ii) the selection of security controls; (iii) the implementation of security controls; (iv) the assessment of security control effectiveness; (v) the authorization of the information system; and (vi) the ongoing monitoring of security controls and the security state of the information system. • Supporting appendices provide additional information regarding the application of the Risk Management Framework to information systems including: (i) references; (ii) glossary; (iii) acronyms; (iv) roles and responsibilities; (v) summary of Risk Management Framework tasks; (vi) security authorization of information systems; (vii) monitoring the security state of information systems; (viii) operational scenarios; and (ix) security controls in external environments.   Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 5 CHAPTER TWO THE FUNDAMENTALS MANAGING INFORMATION SYSTEM-RELATED SECURITY RISKS his chapter describes the basic concepts associated with managing information system-related security risks.  These concepts include: (i) incorporating risk management principles and best practices into organization-wide strategic planning considerations, core missions and business processes, and supporting organizational information systems; (ii) integrating information security requirements into system development life cycle processes; (iii) establishing practical and meaningful boundaries for organizational information systems; and (iv) allocating security controls to organizational information systems as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls. 2.1   INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT Managing information system-related security risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires the involvement of the entire organization—from senior leaders providing the strategic vision and top-level goals and objectives for the organization, to mid-level leaders planning and managing projects, to individuals on the front lines developing, implementing, and operating the systems supporting the organization’s core missions and business processes.  Risk management can be viewed as a holistic activity that is fully integrated into every aspect of the organization.  Figure 2-1 illustrates a three-tiered approach to risk management that addresses risk-related concerns at: (i) the organization level; (ii) the mission and business process level; and (iii) the information system level.15            FIGURE 2-1:  TIERED RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH                                                  15 NIST Special Publication 800-39, Integrated Enterprise-Wide Risk Management: Organization, Mission, and Information System View (projected for publication in 2010), will provide guidance on the holistic approach to risk management.

As part of the overall governance structure established by the organization, the risk management strategy is propagated to organizational officials and contractors with programmatic, planning, developmental, acquisition, operational, and oversight responsibilities, including for example: (i) authorizing officials; (ii) chief information officers; (iii) senior information security officers; (iv) enterprise/information security architects; (v) information system owners/program managers; (vi) information owners/stewards; (vii) information system security officers; (viii) information system security engineers; (ix) information system developers and integrators; (x) system administrators; (xi) contracting officers; and (xii) users.   Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is guided by the risk decisions at Tier 1.  Tier 2 activities are closely associated with enterprise architecture17 and include: (i) defining the core missions and business processes for the organization (including any derivative or related missions and business processes carried out by subordinate organizations); (ii) prioritizing missions and business processes with respect to the goals and objectives of the organization; (iii) defining the types of information that the organization needs to successfully execute the stated missions and business processes and the information flows both internal and external to the organization; (iv) developing an organization-wide information protection strategy and incorporating high-level information security requirements18 into the core missions and business processes; and (v) specifying the degree of autonomy for subordinate organizations (i.e., organizations within the parent organization) that the parent organization permits for assessing, evaluating, mitigating, accepting, and monitoring risk. Because subordinate organizations responsible for carrying out derivative or related missions and business processes may have already invested in their own methods of assessing, evaluating, mitigating, accepting and monitoring risk, parent organizations may allow a greater degree of autonomy within parts of the organization or across the entire organization in order to minimize costs.  When a diversity of risk assessment methods is allowed, organizations may choose to employ when feasible, some means of translation and/or synthesis of the risk-related information to ensure that the output of the different risk assessment activities can be correlated in a meaningful manner.                                                  16 Types of risk include, for example: (i) program/acquisition risk (cost, schedule, performance); (ii) compliance and regulatory risk; (iii) financial risk; (iv) legal risk; (v) operational (mission/business) risk; (vi) political risk; (vii) project risk; (viii) reputational risk; (ix) safety risk; (x) strategic planning risk; and (xi) supply chain risk. 17 Federal Enterprise Architecture Reference Models and Segment and Solution Architectures are defined in the OMB Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Program, FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3, October 2003 and OMB Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM), January 2009, respectively. 18 Information security requirements can be obtained from a variety of sources (e.g., legislation, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and organizational mission/business/operational requirements).  Organization-level security requirements are documented in the information security program plan or equivalent document. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 7 Tier 3 addresses risk from an information system perspective and is guided by the risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2.  Risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2 impact the ultimate selection and deployment of needed safeguards and countermeasures (i.e., security controls) at the information system level.  Information security requirements are satisfied by the selection of appropriate management, operational, and technical security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53.19  The security controls are subsequently allocated to the various components of the information system as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls in accordance with the information security architecture developed by the organization.20  Security controls are typically traceable to the security requirements established by the organization to ensure that the requirements are fully addressed during design, development, and implementation of the information system.  Security controls can be provided by the organization or by an external provider.  Relationships with external providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements.21 Risk management tasks begin early in the system development life cycle and are important in shaping the security capabilities of the information system.  If these tasks are not adequately performed during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases of the system development life cycle, the tasks will, by necessity, be undertaken later in the life cycle and be more costly to implement.  In either situation, all tasks are completed prior to placing the information system into operation or continuing its operation to ensure that: (i) information system-related security risks are being adequately addressed on an ongoing basis; and (ii) the authorizing official explicitly understands and accepts the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of a defined set of security controls and the current security state of the information system. The Risk Management Framework (RMF), illustrated in Figure 2-2, provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle.  The RMF operates primarily at Tier 3 in the risk management hierarchy but can also have interactions at Tiers 1 and 2 (e.g., providing feedback from ongoing authorization decisions to the risk executive [function], dissemination of updated threat and risk information to authorizing officials and information system owners).  The RMF steps include: • Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis.22 • Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions.23                                                   19 The RMF categorization step, including consideration of legislation, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and organizational mission/business/operational requirements, facilitates the identification of security requirements. 20 The allocation of security controls can take place at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy.  For example, security controls that are identified as common controls may be allocated at the organization, mission/business process, or information system level.  See Section 2.4 for additional information on security control allocation. 21 Appendix I provides additional guidance regarding external service providers and the provision of security controls in external environments. 22 FIPS 199 provides security categorization guidance for nonnational security systems.  CNSS Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national security systems. 23 NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides security control selection guidance for nonnational security systems.  CNSS Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national security systems. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 8 • Implement the security controls and describe how the controls are employed within the information system and its environment of operation.   • Assess the security controls using appropriate assessment procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.  • Authorize information system operation based on a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable.  • Monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis including assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to designated organizational officials. Chapter Three provides a detailed description of each of the specific tasks necessary to carry out the six steps in the RMF.                                    FIGURE 2-2:  RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK In summary, there is a significant degree of flexibility in how organizations employ the risk management processes described above.  While it is convenient to portray the risk management approach in Figure 2-1 as hierarchical, the reality of project and organization dynamics can be much more complex.

For risk management to succeed at all levels of the organization, the organization must have a consistent and effective approach to risk management that is applied to all risk management processes and procedures.  Organizational officials identify the resources necessary to complete the risk management tasks described in this publication and ensure that those resources are made available to appropriate personnel.  Resource allocation includes both funding to carry out the risk management tasks and assigning qualified personnel needed to accomplish the tasks.24 2.2   SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE All federal information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, and systems undergoing modification or upgrade, are in some phase of a system development life cycle.25  Requirements definition is a critical part of any system development process and begins very early in the life cycle, typically in the initiation phase.26  Security requirements are a subset of the overall functional and nonfunctional (e.g., quality, assurance) requirements levied on an information system and are incorporated into the system development life cycle simultaneously with the functional and nonfunctional requirements.  Without the early integration of security requirements, significant expense may be incurred by the organization later in the life cycle to address security considerations that could have been included in the initial design.  When security requirements are considered as an integral subset of other information system requirements, the resulting system has fewer weaknesses and deficiencies, and therefore, fewer vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the future. Early integration of information security requirements into the system development life cycle is the most cost-effective and efficient method for an organization to ensure that its protection strategy is implemented.  It also ensures that information security processes are not isolated from the other routine management processes employed by the organization to develop, implement, operate, and maintain information systems supporting ongoing missions and business functions.  In addition to incorporating information security requirements into the system development life cycle, security requirements are also integrated into the program, planning, and budgeting activities within the organization to ensure that resources are available when needed and program/project milestones are completed.  The enterprise architecture provides a central record of this integration within an organization. Ensuring that information security requirements are integrated into the organization’s system development life cycle processes regardless of the type of life cycle processes employed, helps facilitate development and implementation of more resilient information systems to reduce risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  This can be accomplished using the well-established concept of integrated project teams.27 A responsible organizational official (e.g., agency head, mission or business owner, integrated project team leader, program manager, information system owner, authorizing official) ensures that security professionals are an integral part of any information system development activities from the                                                  24 Resource requirements include funding for training organizational personnel to ensure that they can effectively carry out their assigned responsibilities. 25 There are typically five phases in a generic system development life cycle including: (i) initiation; (ii) development/ acquisition; (iii) implementation; (iv) operation/maintenance; and (v) disposal. 26 Organizations may employ a variety of system development life cycle processes including, for example, waterfall, spiral, or agile development. 27 Integrated project teams are multidisciplinary entities consisting of a number of individuals with a range of skills and roles to help facilitate the development of information systems that meet the requirements of the organization. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 10 initial definition of information security requirements at Tier 1 and Tier 2 to the selection of security controls at Tier 3.  Such consideration is used to foster close cooperation among personnel responsible for the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and disposition of information systems and the information security professionals advising the senior leadership on appropriate security controls needed to adequately mitigate risk and protect critical missions and business functions. Finally, organizations maximize the use of security-relevant information (e.g., assessment results, information system documentation, and other artifacts) generated during the system development life cycle to satisfy requirements for similar information needed for information security-related purposes.  Similar security-relevant information concerning common controls, including security controls provided by external providers, is factored into the organization’s risk management process.  The judicious reuse of security-relevant information by organizations is an effective method to help eliminate duplication of effort, reduce documentation, promote reciprocity, and avoid unnecessary costs that may result when security activities are conducted independently of system development life cycle processes.  In addition, reuse promotes greater consistency of information used in the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and disposition of an information system including security-related considerations. 2.3   INFORMATION SYSTEM BOUNDARIES One of the most challenging problems for information system owners, authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers, and information security architects is identifying appropriate boundaries for organizational information systems.28  Well-defined boundaries establish the scope of protection for organizational information systems (i.e., what the organization agrees to protect under its direct management control or within the scope of its responsibilities) and include the people, processes, and information technologies that are part of the systems supporting the organization’s missions and business processes.  Information system boundaries are established in coordination with the security categorization process and before the development of security plans.  Information system boundaries that are too expansive (i.e., too many system components and/or unnecessary architectural complexity) make the risk management process extremely unwieldy and complex.  Boundaries that are too limited increase the number of information systems that must be separately managed and as a consequence, unnecessarily inflate the total information security costs for the organization.  The following sections provide general guidelines to assist organizations in establishing appropriate system boundaries to achieve cost-effective solutions for managing information security-related risks from the operation and use of information systems. 2.3.1   Establishing Information System Boundaries The set of information resources29 allocated to an information system defines the boundary for that system.  Organizations have significant flexibility in determining what constitutes an information system and its associated boundary.  If a set of information resources is identified as an information system, the resources are generally under the same direct management control.30                                                   28 With regard to the risk management process and information security, the term information system boundary is synonymous with authorization boundary. 29 Information resources consist of information and related resources including personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology. 30 For information systems, direct management control involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and associated responsibility and accountability. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 11 Direct management control does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening management.  It is also possible for multiple information systems to be considered as independent subsystems31 of a more complex information system.  This situation may arise in many organizations when smaller information systems are coalesced for purposes of risk management into a larger, more comprehensive system.  On a larger scale, an organization may develop a system of systems involving multiple independent information systems (possibly distributed across a widespread geographic area) supporting a set of common missions and/or business functions.32 In addition to consideration of direct management control, it may also be helpful for organizations to determine if the information resources being identified as an information system: • Support the same mission/business objectives or functions and essentially the same operating characteristics and information security requirements; and • Reside in the same general operating environment (or in the case of a distributed information system, reside in various locations with similar operating environments).33 Since commonality can change over time, this determination is revisited periodically as part of a continuous monitoring process carried out by the organization (see Section 3.6).  While the above considerations may be useful to organizations in determining information system boundaries for purposes of risk management, they are not viewed as limiting the organization’s flexibility in establishing commonsense boundaries that promote effective information security within the available resources of the organization.  Information system owners consult with authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers, information security architects, and the risk executive (function)34 when establishing or changing system boundaries.  The process of establishing information system boundaries and the associated risk management implications is an organization-wide activity that includes careful negotiation among all key participants—taking into account mission and business requirements, technical considerations with respect to information security, and programmatic costs to the organization. Software applications (e.g., database applications, Web applications) hosted by an information system are included in the risk management process since application security is critical to the overall security of the system.35  Software applications depend on the resources provided by the hosting information system and as such, can take advantage of (i.e., leverage) the security controls provided by the system to help provide a foundational level of protection for the hosted applications, when this type of inheritance is applicable.  Additional application-level security controls are provided by the respective software applications, as needed.  Organizations ensure that all security controls, including application-level controls employed in separate software applications, are managed and tracked on an ongoing basis.  Application owners coordinate with information system owners to ensure that information security and risk management activities are carried out as seamlessly as possible among applications and hosting systems.  This coordination includes, for example, consideration for: (i) the selection, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of security controls for hosted applications; (ii) the effects of changes to hosted                                                  31 A subsystem is a major subdivision of an information system consisting of information, information technology, and personnel that perform one or more specific functions. 32 The National Airspace System (NAS) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is an example of a system of systems. 33 Similarity of operating environments includes, for example, consideration of threat, policy, and management. 34 The roles and responsibilities of the risk executive (function) are described in Appendix D. 35 Software applications and information systems hosting the applications may be owned by different organizations. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 12 applications on the overall security state of the information system and the missions and business processes supported by that system; and (iii) the effects of changes to the information system on hosted applications.  Employing strong configuration management and control processes within software applications and the hosting information system, and reusing security control assessment results helps to provide the necessary protection for applications. Security controls provided by the hosted software application are documented in the security plan for the hosting information system and assessed for effectiveness during the risk management process (i.e., during the initial authorization of the information system and subsequently, during the continuous monitoring process).  Application-level security controls are also assessed for effectiveness if the applications are added after the hosting information system is authorized to operate.  Information system owners take appropriate measures to ensure that hosted applications do not affect the security state of the hosting system and obtain the necessary information from application owners to conduct security impact analyses, when needed. 2.3.2   Boundaries for Complex Information Systems The application of security controls within a complex information system can present significant challenges to an organization.  From a centralized development, implementation, and operations perspective, the information system owner, in collaboration with the authorizing official, senior information security officer, information security architect, and information system security engineer, examines the purpose of the information system and considers the feasibility of decomposing the complex system into more manageable subsystems.  From a distributed development, implementation, and operations perspective, the organization recognizes that multiple entities, possibly operating under different policies, may be contributing to the development, implementation, and/or operations of the subsystems that compose the complex information system.  In such a scenario, the organization is responsible for ensuring that these separate subsystems can work together in both a secure and functional manner.  Treating an information system as multiple subsystems, each with its own subsystem boundary, facilitates a more targeted application of security controls to achieve adequate security and a more cost-effective risk management process.  Knowledge of the security properties of individual subsystems does not necessarily provide the complete knowledge of the security properties of the complex information system.  The organization applies best practices in systems and security engineering and documents the decomposition of the information system in the security plan.   Information security architecture plays a key part in the security control selection and allocation process for a complex information system.  This includes monitoring and controlling communications at key internal boundaries among subsystems and providing system-wide common controls (see Section 2.4) that meet or exceed the requirements of the constituent subsystems inheriting those system-wide common controls.  One approach to security control selection and allocation is to categorize each identified subsystem (including dynamic subsystems as described in Section 2.3.3).  Separately categorizing each subsystem does not change the overall categorization of the information system.  Rather, it allows the subsystems to receive a separate and more targeted allocation of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 instead of deploying higher-impact controls across every subsystem.  Another approach is to bundle smaller subsystems into larger subsystems within the overall complex information system, categorize each of the aggregated subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as needed.  While subsystems within complex information systems may exist as complete systems, the subsystems are, in most cases, not treated as independent entities because they are typically interdependent and interconnected. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 13 When the results of security categorizations for the identified subsystems are different, the organization carefully examines the interfaces, information flows, and security-relevant dependencies36 among subsystems and selects security controls for the interconnection of the subsystems to eliminate or reduce potential vulnerabilities in this area.  This helps to ensure that the information system is adequately protected.37  Security controls for the interconnection of subsystems are also employed when the subsystems implement different security policies or are administered by different authorities.  The extent to which the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the complex information system, can be determined by combining security control assessments at the subsystem level and adding system-level considerations addressing interface issues among subsystems.  This approach facilitates a more targeted and cost-effective risk management process by scaling the level of effort of the assessment in accordance with the subsystem security categorization and allowing for reuse of assessment results at the information system level.  Figure 2-3 illustrates the concept of decomposition for a complex information system.          FIGURE 2-3:   DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEM  In the above example, an information system contains a system guard that monitors the flow of information between two local area networks.  The information system can be partitioned into multiple subsystems: (i) local area network one; (ii) local area network two; (iii) the system guard separating the two networks; and (iv) several dynamic subsystems that become part of the system at various points in time (see Section 2.3.3).  Each subsystem within the information system may                                                  36 Subsystem interfaces include ports and protocols.  Information flows address information transmitted between subsystems.  Security-relevant dependencies refer to security functions/services (e.g., encryption, auditing), performed by one subsystem that are required by one or more of the other subsystems. 37 The types of interfaces and couplings among subsystems may introduce inadvertent weaknesses and vulnerabilities in a complex information system.  For example, if a large organizational intranet is decomposed by enterprise services into smaller subsystems (e.g., severable subsystems such as local area network segments) and subsequently categorized individually, the specific protections at the subsystem level may allow a vector of attack against the intranet by erroneously selecting and implementing security controls that are not sufficiently strong with respect to the rest of the system.  To avoid this situation, organizations carefully examine the interfaces among subsystems and take appropriate actions to eliminate potential vulnerabilities in this area, thus helping to ensure that the information system is adequately protected. Information System Boundary SUBSYSTEM LAN TWO Subsystem Boundary SUBSYSTEM GUARD Subsystem Boundary SUBSYSTEM LAN ONE Subsystem Boundary DYNAMIC SUBSYSTEM Subsystem Boundary DYNAMIC SUBSYSTEM Subsystem Boundary Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 14 be categorized individually.  The security categorization of the information system as a whole is not changed by taking into consideration all of the individual subsystem categorizations.  When all subsystems within the complex information system have completed an initial security control assessment, the organization takes additional measures to ensure that: (i) security controls not included in the subsystem assessments are assessed for effectiveness; and (ii) the subsystems work together in a manner that meets the security requirements of the information system.38 2.3.3   Changing Technologies and the Effect on Information System Boundaries Changes to current information technologies and computing paradigms add complications to the traditional tasks of establishing information system boundaries and protecting the missions and business processes supported by organizational information systems.  In particular, net-centric architectures39 (e.g., service-oriented architectures [SOAs], cloud computing) introduce two important concepts: (i) dynamic subsystems; and (ii) external subsystems.  While the concepts of dynamic subsystems and external subsystems (described in the following sections) are not new, the pervasiveness and frequency of their invocation in net-centric architectures can present organizations with significant new challenges. Dynamic Subsystems For many information systems, the determination of subsystems is established at system initiation and maintained throughout the life cycle of the system.  However, there are some instances, most notably in net-centric architectures, where the subsystems that compose the system may not be present at all stages of the life cycle.  Some subsystems may not become part of an information system until sometime after system initiation, while other subsystems may leave the system sometime prior to system termination.  Generally, this will not impact the external boundary of the information system if the dynamic subsystems are in the system design and the appropriate security controls are reflected in the security plan.  But it does impact the subsystems that exist within the boundary at any given point in time. Dynamic subsystems that become part of an organizational information system at various points in time may or may not be under the direct control of the organization.  These subsystems may be provided by external providers (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements).  Regardless of whether the subsystem is or is not controlled by the organization, the expectations of its capabilities have to be considered.  The dynamic inclusion or exclusion of the subsystems may or may not require reassessment of the information system as a whole.  This is determined based on constraints and assumptions (e.g., functions the subsystems perform, connections to other subsystems and other information systems) imposed upon the subsystems at system design and incorporated in the security plan.  So long as the subsystems conform to the identified constraints and assumptions, they can be dynamically added or removed from the information system without requiring reassessments of the entire system.                                                   38 The organization can: (i) issue a single authorization for the entire complex information system (to include bundling assessment results from individual subsystem assessments and any additional assessment results at the system level); or (ii) implement a strategy for managing the risk associated with connecting separately authorized information systems when viewed as a system of systems. 39 A net-centric architecture is a complex system of systems comprised of subsystems and services that are part of a continuously evolving, complex community of people, devices, information, and services interconnected by a network that enhances information sharing and collaboration.  A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an example of a net-centric architecture. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 15 As noted above, the assumptions and constraints on the dynamic subsystems are reflected in the information system design and the security plan.  The determination as to whether the subsystems conform to the assumptions and constraints is addressed during the continuous monitoring phase of the risk management process.  Depending upon the nature of the subsystems (including the functions, connections, and relative trust relationships established with the subsystem providers), the determination of conformance may be performed in a manual or automated manner, and may occur prior to, or during the subsystem connecting/disconnecting to the information system. External Subsystems Another characteristic often apparent in net-centric architectures is that some of the subsystems (or components of subsystems)40 are outside of the direct control of the organization that owns the information system and authorizes its operation.  The nature of such external subsystems can vary from organizations employing external cloud computing services to process, store, and transmit information to organizations allowing platforms under their control to host applications/services developed by some external entity.   As noted in Appendix I (Security Controls in External Environments), FISMA and OMB policy require external providers handling federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same security requirements as federal agencies.  These security requirements also apply to external subsystems storing, processing, or transmitting federal information and any services provided by or associated with the subsystem.  Appendix I further notes that the assurance or confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that the organization places in the external service provider.  In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the organization is able to exert on the external service provider with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of the service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.  In other instances, trust may be based on other factors, such as the experience the organization has with the external service provider, and the confidence (trust) the organization has in the provider taking the correct actions.  There are a variety of factors that can complicate the level of trust issue in the case of net-centric architectures to include: • The delineation between what is owned by the external entity and the organization may be somewhat blurred (e.g., organization-owned platform executing external entity-developed service/application software or firmware); • The degree of control the organization has over the external entity providing/supporting the subsystems/services may be very limited; • The nature and content of the subsystems may be subject to rapid change; and • The subsystems/services may be of such critical nature that they need to be incorporated into organizational information systems very rapidly.  The consequence of the factors above is that some of the more traditional means of verifying the correct functioning of a subsystem and the effectiveness of security controls (e.g., clearly defined requirements, design analysis, testing and evaluation before deployment) may not be feasible for a net-centric subsystem/service. As a result, organizations may be left to depend upon the nature of the trust relationships with the suppliers of the net-centric subsystems/services as the basis for determining whether or not to allow/include the subsystems/services (e.g., use of GSA list of                                                  40 In this context, the term subsystem includes the services provided by or associated with that subsystem. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 16 approved providers).  Alternatively, organizations may allow such subsystems/services to be used only in those instances where they have constrained the nature of information or process flow such that the organization believes that any potential adverse impact is manageable.  Ultimately, when the level of trust in the external provider of subsystems/services is below expectations, the organization: (i) employs compensating controls; (ii) accepts a greater degree of risk; or (iii) does not obtain the service (i.e., performs its core missions and business operations with reduced levels of functionality or possibly no functionality at all). 2.4   SECURITY CONTROL ALLOCATION There are three types of security controls for information systems that can be employed by an organization: (i) system-specific controls (i.e., controls that provide a security capability for a particular information system only); (ii) common controls (i.e., controls that provide a security capability for multiple information systems); or (iii) hybrid controls (i.e., controls that have both system-specific and common characteristics).41  The organization allocates security controls to an information system consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.42  This activity is carried out as an organization-wide activity involving authorizing officials, information system owners, chief information security officer, senior information security officer, enterprise architect, information security architect, information system security officers, common control providers, and risk executive (function). As part of the information security architecture, organizations are encouraged to identify and implement security controls that can support multiple information systems efficiently and effectively as a common capability (i.e., common controls).  When these controls are used to support a specific information system, they are referenced by that specific system as inherited controls.  Common controls promote more cost-effective and consistent information security across the organization and can also simplify risk management activities.  By allocating security controls to an information system as system-specific controls, hybrid controls, or common controls, the organization assigns responsibility and accountability to specific organizational entities for the overall development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of those controls. The organization has significant flexibility in deciding which families of security controls or specific controls from selected families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are appropriate for the different types of allocations.  Since the security control allocation process involves the assignment and provision of security capabilities derived from security controls, the organization ensures that there is effective communication among all entities either receiving or providing such capabilities.  This communication includes, for example, ensuring that common control authorization results and continuous monitoring information are readily available to those organizational entities inheriting common controls, and that any changes to common controls are effectively communicated to those affected by such changes.43  Figure 2-4 illustrates security                                                  41 NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides additional guidance on security controls for information systems. 42 Allocation is a term used to describe the process an organization employs: (i) to determine whether security controls are defined as system-specific, hybrid, or common; and (ii) to assign security controls to specific information system components responsible for providing a particular security capability (e.g., router, server, remote sensor).  43 Communication regarding the security status of common (inherited) controls is essential irrespective of whether the common control provider is internal or external to the organization.  Appendix I provides guidance for organizations relying on security controls in external environments including the types of contractual agreements and arrangements that are necessary to ensure appropriate security-relevant information is conveyed to the organization from external providers. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 2  PAGE 17 control allocation within an organization and using the RMF to produce information for senior leaders (including authorizing officials) on the ongoing security state of organizational information systems and the missions and business processes supported by those systems.

Whenever possible and consistent with core missions/business processes, organizations align risk management roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the system development life cycle.  RMF tasks are executed concurrently with or as part of system development life cycle processes, taking into account appropriate dependencies.  This helps to ensure that organizations are effectively integrating the process of managing information system-related security risks with system development life cycle processes. Each RMF task description includes the individual or group with the primary responsibility for carrying out the task, the supporting roles that may be called upon to assist in completing the task, the system development life cycle phase most closely associated with the task, supplemental guidance to help explain how the task is executed, and appropriate references for publications or Web sites with information related to the task.46  To summarize the key risk management-related activities to be carried out by the organization, a milestone checkpoint is provided for each step in the RMF.  The milestone checkpoints contain a series of questions for the organization to help ensure that important activities described in a particular step in the RMF have been completed prior to proceeding to the next step. The process of implementing the RMF tasks (i.e., the order and manner in which the tasks occur and are executed, the names of primary/supporting roles, the names and format of artifacts) may vary from organization to organization.  The RMF tasks can be applied at appropriate phases in the system development life cycle.  While the tasks appear in sequential order, there can be many points in the risk management process that require divergence from the sequential order including the need for iterative cycles between tasks and revisiting tasks.  For example, the results from security control assessments can trigger remediation actions on the part of an information system                                                  44 The process for managing risk described in this publication can be tailored to meet the needs of many communities of interest within the federal government including, for example, the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities.  Tailoring provides flexibility in applying the risk management concepts associated with the RMF in a manner that is most suitable for the organizations and the information systems involved. 45 Appendix D describes the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an organization’s risk management process.   46 A reference is included in the RMF task list if: (i) the reference is generally applicable to both national security systems and nonnational security systems; (ii) the reference for nonnational security systems has an equivalent or supporting reference for national security systems; or (iii) the reference relates to specific national security community guidance regarding the implementation of certain NIST standards or guidelines.  T Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 19 owner, which can in turn require the reassessment of selected controls.  Monitoring the security controls in an information system can also generate a potential cycle of tracking changes to the system and its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses, taking remediation actions, reassessing security controls, and reporting the security status of the system.  There may also be other opportunities to diverge from the sequential nature of the tasks when it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so.  For example, while the security control assessment tasks are listed after the security control implementation tasks, some organizations may choose to begin the assessment of certain controls as soon as they are implemented but prior to the complete implementation of all controls described in the security plan.  This may result in the organization assessing the physical and environmental protection controls within a facility prior to assessing the security controls employed in the hardware and software components of the information system (which may be implemented at a later time).  Regardless of the task ordering, the last step before an information system is placed into operation is the explicit acceptance of risk by the authorizing official.   RMF steps and associated tasks can be applied to both new development and legacy information systems.  For legacy systems, organizations can use RMF Steps 1 through 3 to confirm that the security categorization has been completed and is appropriate and that the requisite security controls have been selected and allocated.  Applying the first three steps in the RMF to legacy systems can be viewed as a gap analysis to determine if the necessary and sufficient security controls (i.e., system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) have been appropriately selected and allocated.  Security control weaknesses and deficiencies, if discovered, can be subsequently addressed in RMF Steps 3 through 6 similar to new development systems.  If no weaknesses or deficiencies are discovered in the security controls during the gap analysis and there is a current security authorization in effect, the organization can move directly to the last step in the RMF, continuous monitoring.  If a current security authorization is not in place, the organization continues with RMF Steps 4 through 6. The security categorization process influences the level of effort expended when implementing the RMF tasks.  Information systems supporting the most critical and/or sensitive operations and assets within the organization as indicated by the security categorization, demand the greatest level of attention and effort to ensure that appropriate information security and risk mitigation are achieved.  Most RMF tasks can be carried out by external providers with appropriate contractual agreements or other arrangements in place (see Appendix I).  A summary table of the RMF tasks is provided in Appendix E.    Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 20   APPLICATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK The Risk Management Framework and associated RMF tasks apply to both information system owners and common control providers.  In addition to supporting the authorization of information systems, the RMF tasks support the selection, development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and ongoing monitoring of common controls inherited by organizational information systems.  Execution of the RMF tasks by common control providers, both internal and external to the organization, helps to ensure that the security capabilities provided by the common controls can be inherited by information system owners with a degree of assurance appropriate for their information protection needs.  This approach recognizes the importance of security control effectiveness within information systems and the infrastructure supporting those systems. Since the tasks in the RMF are described in a sequential manner, organizations may choose to deviate from that sequential structure in order to be consistent with their established management and system development life cycle processes or to achieve more cost-effective and efficient solutions with regard to the execution of the tasks.  Regardless of the task ordering, the last step before an information system is placed into operation is the explicit acceptance of risk by the authorizing official.  Organizations may also execute certain RMF tasks in an iterative manner or in different phases of the system development life cycle.  For example, security control assessments may be carried out during system development, system implementation, and system operation/maintenance (as part of continuous monitoring). Organizations may also choose to expend a greater level of effort on certain RMF tasks and commit fewer resources to other tasks based on the level of maturity of selected processes and activities within the organization.  Since the RMF is life cycle-based, there will be a need to revisit various tasks over time depending on how the organization manages changes to the information systems and the environments in which those systems operate.  Managing information security-related risks for an information system is viewed as part of a larger organization-wide risk management activity carried out by senior leaders.  The RMF must simultaneously provide a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks from the operation and use of organizational information systems and the flexibility and agility to support the core missions and business operations of the organization in highly dynamic environments of operation. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 21 3.1   RMF STEP 1 – CATEGORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY CATEGORIZATION TASK 1-1:  Categorize the information system and document the results of the security categorization in the security plan. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner; Information Owner/Steward. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  The security categorization process is carried out by the information system owner and information owner/steward in cooperation and collaboration with appropriate organizational officials (i.e., senior leaders with mission/business function and/or risk management responsibilities).  The security categorization process is conducted as an organization-wide activity taking into consideration the enterprise architecture and the information security architecture.  This helps to ensure that individual information systems are categorized based on the mission and business objectives of the organization.  The results of the security categorization process influence the selection of appropriate security controls for the information system and also, where applicable, the minimum assurance requirements for that system.  The organization may consider decomposing the information system into multiple subsystems to more efficiently and effectively allocate security controls to the system.  One approach is to categorize each identified subsystem (including dynamic subsystems).  Separately categorizing each subsystem does not change the overall categorization of the information system.  Rather, it allows the constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 instead of deploying higher-impact controls across every subsystem.  Another approach is to bundle smaller subsystems into larger subsystems within the information system, categorize each of the aggregated subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as appropriate.  Security categorization information is documented in the system identification section of the security plan or included as an attachment to the plan. The risk executive (function) provides guidance and relevant information to authorizing officials concerning the risk management strategy for the organization (e.g., risk assessment methodologies employed by the organization, evaluation of risks determined, risk mitigation approaches, organizational risk tolerance, approaches for monitoring risk over time, known existing aggregated risks from current information systems, and other sources of risk).  Security categorization determinations consider potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

INFORMATION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION TASK 1-2:  Describe the information system (including system boundary) and document the description in the security plan. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  Descriptive information about the information system is documented in the system identification section of the security plan, included in attachments to the plan, or referenced in other standard sources for information generated as part of the system development life cycle.  Duplication of information is avoided, whenever possible.  The level of detail provided in the security plan is determined by the organization and is typically commensurate with the security categorization of the information system.  Information may be added to the system description as it becomes available during the system development life cycle and execution of the RMF tasks.  A system description may include, for example: - Full descriptive name of the information system including associated acronym; - Unique information system identifier (typically a number or code); - Information system owner and authorizing official including contact information; - Parent or governing organization that manages, owns, and/or controls the information system; - Location of the information system and environment in which the system operates; - Version or release number of the information system; Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 22 - Purpose, functions, and capabilities of the information system and missions/business processes supported; - How the information system is integrated into the enterprise architecture and information security architecture; - Status of the information system with respect to acquisition and/or system development life cycle; - Results of the security categorization process for the information and information system; - Types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system; - Boundary of the information system for risk management and security authorization purposes; - Applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, or standards affecting the security of the information system; - Architectural description of the information system including network topology; - Hardware and firmware devices included within the information system; - System and applications software resident on the information system; - Hardware, software, and system interfaces (internal and external); - Subsystems (static and dynamic) associated with the information system; - Information flows and paths (including inputs and outputs) within the information system; - Cross domain devices/requirements; - Network connection rules for communicating with external information systems; - Interconnected information systems and identifiers for those systems; - Encryption techniques used for information processing, transmission, and storage; - Cryptographic key management information (public key infrastructures, certificate authorities, etc.); - Information system users (including organizational affiliations, access rights, privileges, citizenship, if applicable); - Ownership/operation of information system (e.g., government-owned, government-operated; government-owned, contractor-operated; contractor-owned, contractor-operated; nonfederal [state and local governments, grantees]); - Security authorization date and authorization termination date; - Incident response points of contact; and - Other information as required by the organization.

Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner. Supporting Roles:  Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  The registration process begins by identifying the information system (and subsystems, if appropriate) in the system inventory and establishes a relationship between the information system and the parent or governing organization that owns, manages, and/or controls the system.  Information system registration, in accordance with organizational policy, uses information in the system identification section of the security plan to inform the parent or governing organization of: (i) the existence of the information system; (ii) the key characteristics of the system; and (iii) any security implications for the organization due to the ongoing operation of the system.  Information system registration provides organizations with an effective management/tracking tool that is necessary for security status reporting in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidance, or regulations.  Those subsystems that are more dynamic in nature (e.g., subsystems in net-centric architectures) may not be present throughout all phases of the system development life cycle.  Such subsystems are registered either as a subset of a well-defined information system or a method of registration for dynamic subsystems is implemented that includes as much information as feasible.  Some information about dynamic subsystems is known prior to the subsystem manifesting itself in the information system (e.g., assumptions and constraints specified in the security plan).  However, more detailed information may not be known until the subsystem manifests itself.

Primary Responsibility:  Chief Information Officer or Senior Information Security Officer; Information Security Architect; Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information System Owner; Information System Security Engineer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  Common controls are security controls that are inherited by one or more organizational information systems.  Common controls are identified by the chief information officer and/or senior information security officer in collaboration with the information security architect and assigned to specific organizational entities (designated as common control providers) for development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring.  Common control providers may also be information system owners when the common controls are resident within an information system.  The organization consults information system owners when identifying common controls to ensure that the security capability provided by the inherited controls is sufficient to deliver adequate protection.  When the common controls provided by the organization are not sufficient for information systems inheriting the controls, the system owners supplement the common controls with system-specific or hybrid controls to achieve the required protection for the system and/or accept greater risk.  Information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the security plans of the common control providers.  Organizations may choose to defer common control identification and security control selection until a later phase in the system development life cycle.  When common controls are not resident within an information system (e.g., physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls), the organization selects one or more senior organizational officials or executives to serve as authorizing officials for those controls.  These authorizing officials are responsible for accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the deployment of the security controls provided by common control providers and inherited by organizational information systems.  Common control providers are responsible for: (i) documenting common controls in a security plan (or equivalent document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that common controls are developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness by qualified assessors with a level of independence required by the organization; (iii) documenting assessment findings in a security assessment report; (iv) producing a plan of action and milestones for all common controls deemed less than effective (i.e., having unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls); (v) receiving authorization for the common controls from the designated authorizing official; and (vi) monitoring common control effectiveness on an ongoing basis. Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (whose systems are inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or executive responsible and accountable for the controls.  The organization ensures that common control providers keep this information current since the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems.  Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls are used by authorizing officials within the organization to make risk-based decisions in the security authorization process for their information systems.  The use of common controls is documented within the security plans for information systems inheriting those controls.  Organizations ensure that common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast changes in the status of common controls that adversely affect the protections being provided by and expected of the common controls.  Common control providers are able to quickly inform information system owners when problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an assessment or reassessment of a common control indicates the control is flawed in some manner, when a new threat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting against the new threat or attack method).  Organizations are encouraged, when feasible, to employ automated management systems to maintain records of the specific common controls used in each organizational information system to enhance the ability of common control providers to rapidly communicate with information system owners.  If common controls are provided to the organization (and its information systems) by entities external to the organization (e.g., shared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared service providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed controls.  Information obtained from external organizations regarding the effectiveness of common controls is factored into authorization decisions.

Primary Responsibility:  Information Security Architect; Information System Owner. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  The security controls are selected based on the security categorization of the information system.  The security control selection process includes, as appropriate: (i) choosing a set of baseline security controls; (ii) tailoring the baseline security controls by applying scoping, parameterization, and compensating control guidance; (iii) supplementing the tailored baseline security controls, if necessary, with additional controls and/or control enhancements to address unique organizational needs based on a risk assessment (either formal or informal) and local conditions including environment of operation, organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances; and (iv) specifying minimum assurance requirements, as appropriate.  Organizations document in the security plan, the decisions (e.g., tailoring, supplementation, etc.) taken during the security control selection process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions.  The security plan contains an overview of the security requirements for the information system in sufficient detail to determine that the security controls selected would meet those requirements.  The security plan, in addition to the list of security controls to be implemented, describes the intended application of each control in the context of the information system with sufficient detail to enable a compliant implementation of the control.  During the security control selection process organizations may begin planning for the continuous monitoring process by developing a monitoring strategy.  The strategy can include, for example, monitoring criteria such as the volatility of specific security controls and the appropriate frequency of monitoring specific controls.  Organizations may choose to address security control volatility and frequency of monitoring during control selection as inputs to the continuous monitoring process.  The monitoring strategy can be included in the security plan to support the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing authorization (see Task 2-3).  Information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the security plans of the common control providers (see Task 2-1).  Information system owners can refer to the security authorization packages prepared by common control providers when making determinations regarding the adequacy of common controls inherited by their respective systems. For net-centric architectures where subsystems may be added or removed from an information system dynamically, the organization includes in the security plan for the system: (i) descriptions of the functions of the dynamic subsystems; (ii) the security controls employed in the subsystems; (iii) constraints/assumptions regarding the functions of the dynamic subsystems and the associated security controls in the subsystems; (iv) dependencies of other subsystems on the proper functioning of the security controls of the dynamic subsystems; (v) procedures for determining that the dynamic subsystems conform to the security plan, assumptions, and constraints; and (vi) the impact of the dynamic subsystems and associated security controls on existing security controls in the information system.  While inclusion of a dynamic subsystem may impact the information system or some of the currently identified subsystems, it does not necessarily mean the subsystem will impact the security of the system or other subsystems.  That is, not all subsystems are security relevant.  Changes in the net-centric architectures that exceed the anticipated limits of the security plan may not be allowed or may require reassessment prior to being approved.  When security controls are designated as common controls, the organization ensures that sufficient information is available to information system owners and authorizing officials to support the risk management process.  When security services are provided by external providers (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization: (i) defines the external services provided to the organization; (ii) describes how the external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the organization; and (iii) obtains the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable.  The organization also considers that replicated subsystems within a complex information system may exhibit common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a common threat source, thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied upon as a risk mitigation measure.  The impact due to a security incident against one constituent subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.

Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Initiation (concept/requirements definition). Supplemental Guidance:  A critical aspect of risk management is the ongoing monitoring of security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.  An effective monitoring strategy is developed early in the system development life cycle (i.e., during system design or COTS procurement decision) and can be included in the security plan.  The implementation of a robust continuous monitoring program allows an organization to understand the security state of the information system over time and maintain the initial security authorization in a highly dynamic environment of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business functions.  The ongoing monitoring of security controls using automated tools and supporting databases facilitates near real-time risk management for the information system.  An effective monitoring program includes: (i) configuration management and control processes; (ii) security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of operation; (iii) assessment of selected security controls employed within and inherited by the information system (including controls in dynamic subsystems); and (iv) security status reporting to appropriate organizational officials.  The continuous monitoring strategy for the information system identifies the security controls to be monitored, the frequency of monitoring, and the control assessment approach.  The strategy defines how changes to the information system will be monitored, how security impact analyses will be conducted, and the security status reporting requirements including recipients of the status reports. The criteria for selecting security controls to be monitored post deployment and for determining the frequency of such monitoring is established by the information system owner or common control provider in collaboration with selected organizational officials including, for example, the authorizing official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, and risk executive (function).  The selection criteria reflect the priorities and importance of the information system to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  Security controls that are volatile (i.e., most likely to change over time), critical to certain aspects of the organization’s protection strategy, or identified in current plans of action and milestones are assessed as frequently as necessary consistent with the criticality of the function and capability of the monitoring tools.  The use of automation facilitates a greater frequency and volume of security control assessments. Determining the frequency for assessing security controls inherited by the information system (i.e., common controls) includes the organization’s determination of the trustworthiness of the common control provider.  An organizational assessment of risk (either formal or informal) can also be used to guide the selection of specific security controls to be monitored and the frequency of such monitoring.  The approach to security control assessments during continuous monitoring may include detection of the status of information system components and analysis of historical, operational data, as well as the reuse of assessment procedures and results that supported the initial authorization decision. The authorizing official or designated representative approve the monitoring strategy including the set of security controls that are to be monitored on an ongoing basis as well as the frequency of the monitoring activities.  The approval of the monitoring strategy can be obtained in conjunction with the security plan approval.  The monitoring of security controls continues throughout the system development life cycle.  For security controls employed in information systems with dynamic subsystems, the monitoring strategy accounts for subsystems that did not exist at the beginning of the system development life cycle.  An effective monitoring strategy for dynamic subsystems achieves an appropriate balance with regard to risk by: (i) not placing unnecessary or unrealistic burdens on the organization by requiring reauthorization of the information system each time a new subsystem is added or removed; and (ii) not compromising the accepted security posture of the overall system.

Primary Responsibility:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative.   Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 27 Supplemental Guidance:  The independent review of the security plan by the authorizing official or designated representative with support from the senior information security officer, chief information officer, and risk executive (function), helps determine if the plan is complete, consistent, and satisfies the stated security requirements for the information system.  The security plan review also helps to determine, to the greatest extent possible with available planning or operational documents, if the security plan correctly and effectively identifies the potential risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, that would be incurred if the controls identified in the plan were implemented as intended.  Based on the results of this independent review and analysis, the authorizing official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, or risk executive (function) may recommend changes to the security plan.  If the security plan is deemed unacceptable, the authorizing official or designated representative sends the plan back to the information system owner (or common control provider) for appropriate action.  If the security plan is deemed acceptable, the authorizing official or designated representative approves the plan.  The acceptance of the security plan represents an important milestone in both the risk management process and the system development life cycle. The authorizing official or designated representative, by approving the security plan, agrees to the set of security controls (system-specific, hybrid, and/or common controls) proposed to meet the security requirements for the information system.  This approval allows the risk management process to advance to the next step in the RMF (i.e., the implementation of the security controls).  The approval of the security plan also establishes the level of effort required to successfully complete the remainder of the steps in the RMF and provides the basis of the security specification for the acquisition of the information system, subsystems, or components.

Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  Security control implementation is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.  The information security architecture serves as a resource to allocate security controls (including, for example, security mechanisms and services) to an information system and any organization-defined subsystems.  Security controls targeted for deployment within the information system (including subsystems) are allocated to specific system components responsible for providing a particular security capability.  Not all security controls need to be allocated to every subsystem.  Categorization of subsystems, information security architecture, and allocation of security controls work together to help achieve a suitable balance.  Allocating some security controls as common controls or hybrid controls is part of this architectural process.  Organizations use best practices when implementing the security controls within the information system including system and software engineering methodologies, security engineering principles, and secure coding techniques.  In addition, organizations ensure that mandatory configuration settings are established and implemented on information technology products in accordance with federal and organizational policies (e.g., Federal Desktop Core Configuration).  Information system security engineers with support from information system security officers employ a sound security engineering process that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures the integration of those requirements into information technology products and systems through purposeful security design or configuration.  When available, organizations consider the use of information technology products that have been tested, evaluated, or validated by approved, independent, third-party assessment facilities.  In addition, organizations satisfy, where applicable, minimum assurance requirements when implementing security controls.  Assurance requirements are directed at the activities and actions that security control developers and implementers define and apply to increase the level of confidence that the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.  Assurance requirements address the quality of the design, development, and implementation of the security functions in the information system.  For higher-impact systems (i.e., potential high-value targets) in situations where specific and credible threat information indicates the likelihood of advanced cyber attacks, additional assurance measures are considered.  Organizations consider any implementation-related issues associated with the integration and/or interfaces among common controls and system-specific controls. For the identified common controls inherited by the information system, information system security engineers with support from information system security officers coordinate with the common control provider to determine the most appropriate way to apply the common controls to the organizational information systems.  For certain management and operational controls, formal integration into information technology products, services, and systems may not be required.  For certain types of operational and/or technical controls, implementation may require additional components, products, or services to enable the information system to utilize the previously selected common controls to the fullest extent.  If selection of common controls previously had been deferred, identification of common controls inherited by the information system is revisited to determine if better determinations can be made at this point in the system development life cycle.  Information system owners can refer to the authorization packages prepared by common control providers when making determinations regarding the adequacy of the implementations of common controls for their respective systems.  For common controls that do not meet the protection needs of the information systems inheriting the controls or that have unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies, the system owners identify compensating or supplementary controls to be implemented.  To the maximum extent and consistent with the flexibility allowed in applying the tasks in the RMF, organizations and their contractors conduct initial security control assessments (also referred to as developmental testing and evaluation) during information system development and implementation.  Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle facilitates the early identification of weaknesses and deficiencies and provides the most cost-effective method for initiating corrective actions.  Issues found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials for early resolution, as appropriate.  The results of the initial security control assessments can also be used during the security authorization process to avoid delays or costly repetition of assessments.  Assessment results that are subsequently reused in other phases of the system development life cycle meet the reuse requirements (including independence) established by the organization.

Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  Security control documentation describes how system-specific, hybrid, and common controls are implemented.  The documentation formalizes plans and expectations regarding the overall functionality of the information system.  The functional description of the security control implementation includes planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs where appropriate, typically for those technical controls that are employed in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system.  Documentation of security control implementation allows for traceability of decisions prior to and after deployment of the information system.  The level of effort expended on documentation of the information system is commensurate with the purpose, scope, and impact of the system with respect to organizational missions, business functions, and operations.  To the extent possible, organizations reference existing documentation (either by vendors or other organizations that have employed the same or similar information systems), use automated support tools, and maximize communications to increase the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of security control implementation.  The documentation also addresses platform dependencies and includes any additional information necessary to describe how the security capability required by the security control is achieved at the level of detail sufficient to support control assessment.  Documentation for security control implementation follows best practices for hardware and software development as well as for system/security engineering disciplines and is consistent with established organizational policies and procedures for documenting system development life cycle activities.  Whenever possible and practicable for technical security controls that are mechanism-based, organizations take maximum advantage of functional specifications provided by or obtainable from hardware and software vendors and/or systems integrators including security-relevant documentation that may assist the organization during the assessment and monitoring of the controls.  Similarly, for management and operational controls, organizations obtain security control implementation information from appropriate organizational entities (e.g., facilities offices, human resource offices, physical security offices).  Since the enterprise architecture and information security architecture established by the organization significantly influence the approach used to implement security controls, providing documentation of this process helps to ensure traceability with regard to meeting the organization’s information security requirements.

Primary Responsibility:  Security Control Assessor. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The security assessment plan provides the objectives for the security control assessment, a detailed roadmap of how to conduct such an assessment, and assessment procedures.  The assessment plan reflects the type of assessment the organization is conducting (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, independent verification and validation, assessments supporting security authorizations or reauthorizations, audits, continuous monitoring, assessments subsequent to remediation actions).  Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the development/acquisition and implementation phases of the life cycle permits the identification of weaknesses and deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective method for initiating corrective actions.  Issues found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials for early resolution, as appropriate.  The results of security control assessments carried out during system development and implementation can also be used (consistent with reuse criteria) during the security authorization process to avoid system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments.  The security assessment plan is reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials to ensure that the plan is consistent with the security objectives of the organization, employs state-of-the practice tools, techniques, procedures, and automation to support the concept of continuous monitoring and near real-time risk management, and is cost-effective with regard to the resources allocated for the assessment.  The purpose of the security assessment plan approval is two-fold: (i) to establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment; and (ii) to bound the level of effort for the security control assessment.  An approved security assessment plan helps to ensure that an appropriate level of resources is applied toward determining security control effectiveness.  When security controls are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization obtains a security assessment plan from the provider. Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in selecting security control assessors.  Organizations also ensure that security control assessors possess the required skills and technical expertise to successfully carry out assessments of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.  This includes knowledge of and experience with the specific hardware, software, and firmware components employed by the organization.  An independent assessor is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of security controls employed within or inherited by an information system.  Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the development, operation, and/or management of the information system or the determination of security control effectiveness.  Independent security control assessment services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization.  Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting the assessment of the security controls.  The authorizing official or designated representative determines the required level of independence for security control assessors based on the results of the security categorization process for the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a risk-based decision on whether to place the information system into operation or continue its operation.  In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the security control assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results.  The authorizing official consults with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior information security officer, and the chief information officer to discuss the implications of any decisions on assessor independence in the types of special circumstances described above.  This discussion may occur prior to each security assessment or only once if an organization is establishing an organizational policy and approach for specific special circumstances that will be applied to all information systems meeting the specific special circumstance criteria.  Security control assessments in support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors.

Primary Responsibility:  Security Control Assessor. Supporting Roles:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  Security control assessments determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.  Security control assessments occur as early as practicable in the system development life cycle, preferably during the development phase of the information system.  These types of assessments are referred to as developmental testing and evaluation and are intended to validate that the required security controls are implemented correctly and consistent with the established information security architecture.  Developmental testing and evaluation activities include, for example, design and code reviews, application scanning, and regression testing.  Security weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the system development life cycle can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost-effective manner before proceeding to subsequent phases in the life cycle.  The objective is to identify the information security architecture and security controls up front and to ensure that the system design and testing validate the implementation of these controls. The information system owner relies on the technical expertise and judgment of assessors to: (i) assess the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system using assessment procedures specified in the security assessment plan; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities.  The assessor findings are an unbiased, factual reporting of the weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the security control assessment.  Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation to conduct security control assessments to help: (i) increase the speed and overall effectiveness and efficiency of the assessments; and (ii) support the concept of ongoing monitoring of the security state of organizational information systems.  When iterative development processes such as agile development are employed, this typically results in an iterative assessment as each cycle is conducted.  A similar process is used for assessing security controls in COTS information technology products employed within the information system.  Even when iterative development is not employed, organizations may choose to begin assessing security controls prior to the complete implementation of all security controls listed in the security plan.  This type of incremental assessment is appropriate if it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so.  For example, policy, procedures, and plans may be assessed prior to the assessment of the technical security controls in the hardware and software. In many cases, common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by the information system) may be assessed prior to the security controls employed within the system. The organization ensures that assessors have access to: (i) the information system and environment of operation where the security controls are employed; and (ii) the appropriate documentation, records, artifacts, test results, and other materials needed to assess the security controls.  In addition, assessors have the required degree of independence as determined by the authorizing official (see Appendix D.13 and Appendix F.4).  Security control assessments in support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors.  Assessor independence during continuous monitoring, although not mandated, facilitates reuse of assessment results when reauthorization is required.  When security controls are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization ensures that assessors have access to the information system/environment of operation where the controls are employed as well as appropriate information needed to carry out the assessment.  The organization also obtains any information related to existing assessments that may have been conducted by the external provider and reuses such assessment information whenever possible in accordance with the reuse criteria established by the organization.  Descriptive information about the information system is typically documented in the system identification section of the security plan or included by reference or as attachments to the plan.  Supporting materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and records showing evidence of security control implementation are identified as well.  In order to make the risk management process as timely and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous assessment results, when reasonable and appropriate, is strongly recommended.  For example, a recent audit of an information system may have produced information about the effectiveness of selected security controls.  Another opportunity to reuse previous assessment results comes from programs that test and evaluate the security features of commercial information technology products.  Additionally, if prior assessment results from the system developer are available, the security control assessor, under appropriate circumstances, may incorporate those results into the assessment.  And finally, assessment results are reused to support reciprocity where possible.

Primary Responsibility:  Security Control Assessor. Supporting Roles:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The results of the security control assessment, including recommendations for correcting any weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls, are documented in the security assessment report.  The security assessment report is one of three key documents in the security authorization package developed for authorizing officials.  The assessment report includes information from the assessor necessary to determine the effectiveness of the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system based upon the assessor’s findings.  The security assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s determination of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  Security control assessment results are documented at a level of detail appropriate for the assessment in accordance with the reporting format prescribed by organizational and/or federal policies.  The reporting format is also appropriate for the type of security control assessment conducted (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, self-assessments, independent verification and validation, independent assessments supporting the security authorization process or subsequent reauthorizations, assessments during continuous monitoring, assessments subsequent to remediation actions, independent audits/evaluations). Security control assessment results obtained during system development are brought forward in an interim report and included in the final security assessment report.  This supports the concept that the security assessment report is an evolving document that includes assessment results from all relevant phases of the system development life cycle including the results generated during continuous monitoring.  Organizations may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a security control assessment.  An executive summary provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of the assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and/or recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls. References:  NIST Special Publication 800-53A. REMEDIATION ACTIONS TASK 4-4:  Conduct initial remediation actions on security controls based on the findings and recommendations of the security assessment report and reassess remediated control(s), as appropriate. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Security Control Assessor. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer; Security Control Assessor. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Development/Acquisition; Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The security assessment report provides visibility into specific weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system that could not reasonably be resolved during system development.  The findings generated during the security control assessment facilitate a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in accordance with organizational priorities.  Information system owners and common control providers, in collaboration with selected organizational officials (e.g., information system security engineer, authorizing official designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, information owner/steward), may decide that certain findings are inconsequential and present no significant risk to the organization.  Alternatively, the organizational officials may decide that certain findings are in fact, significant, requiring immediate remediation actions.  In all cases, organizations review assessor findings and determine the severity or seriousness of the findings (i.e., the potential adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) and whether the findings are sufficiently significant to be worthy of further investigation or remediation.  An updated assessment of risk (either formal or informal) based on the results of the findings produced during the security control assessment and any inputs from the risk executive (function), helps to determine the initial remediation actions and the prioritization of such actions.  Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance with organizational priorities, providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and sensitive missions and business functions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 33 the greatest degree of risk.  If weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls are corrected, the remediated controls are reassessed for effectiveness.  Security control reassessments determine the extent to which the remediated controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.  Exercising caution not to change the original assessment results, assessors update the security assessment report with the findings from the reassessment.  The security plan is updated based on the findings of the security control assessment and any remediation actions taken.  The updated security plan reflects the actual state of the security controls after the initial assessment and any modifications by the information system owner or common control provider in addressing recommendations for corrective actions.  At the completion of the assessment, the security plan contains an accurate list and description of the security controls implemented (including compensating controls) and a list of residual vulnerabilities. Organizations can prepare an optional addendum to the security assessment report that is transmitted to the authorizing official.  The optional addendum provides information system owners and common control providers an opportunity to respond to the initial findings of assessors.  The addendum may include, for example, information regarding initial remediation actions taken by information system owners or common control providers in response to assessor findings, or provide an owner’s perspective on the findings (e.g., including additional explanatory material, rebutting certain findings, and correcting the record).  The addendum to the security assessment report does not change or influence in any manner, the initial assessor findings provided in the original report.  Information provided in the addendum is considered by authorizing officials in their risk-based authorization decisions.  Organizations may choose to employ an issue resolution process to help determine the appropriate actions to take with regard to the security control weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the assessment.  Issue resolution can help address vulnerabilities and associated risk, false positives, and other factors that may provide useful information to authorizing officials regarding the security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.  The issue resolution process can also help to ensure that only substantive items are identified and transferred to the plan of actions and milestones. References:  NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-53A.        Milestone Checkpoint #4 - Has the organization developed a comprehensive plan to assess the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system? - Was the assessment plan reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials?  - Has the organization considered the appropriate level of assessor independence for the security control assessment? - Has the organization provided all of the essential supporting assessment-related materials needed by the assessor(s) to conduct an effective security control assessment? - Has the organization examined opportunities for reusing assessment results from previous assessments or from other sources? - Did the assessor(s) complete the security control assessment in accordance with the stated assessment plan? - Did the organization receive the completed security assessment report with appropriate findings and recommendations from the assessor(s)? - Did the organization take the necessary remediation actions to address the most important weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system and its environment of operation based on the findings and recommendations in the security assessment report? - Did the organization update appropriate security plans based on the findings and recommendations in the security assessment report and any subsequent changes to the information system and its environment of operation?  Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 34 3.5   RMF STEP 5 – AUTHORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES TASK 5-1:   Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the findings and recommendations of the security assessment report excluding any remediation actions taken. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The plan of action and milestones, prepared for the authorizing official by the information system owner or the common control provider, is one of three key documents in the security authorization package and describes the specific tasks that are planned: (i) to correct any weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls noted during the assessment; and (ii) to address the residual vulnerabilities in the information system.  The plan of action and milestones identifies: (i) the tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion either before or after information system implementation; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; (iii) any milestones in meeting the tasks; and (iv) the scheduled completion dates for the milestones.  The plan of action and milestones is used by the authorizing official to monitor progress in correcting weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the security control assessment.  All security weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security control assessment are documented in the security assessment report to maintain an effective audit trail.  Organizations develop specific plans of action and milestones based on the results of the security control assessment and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidance, or regulations.  Plan of action and milestones entries are not required when weaknesses or deficiencies are remediated during the assessment or prior to the submission of the authorization package to the authorizing official. Organizations define a strategy for developing plans of action and milestones that facilitates a prioritized approach to risk mitigation that is consistent across the organization.  The strategy helps to ensure that organizational plans of action and milestones are based on: (i) the security categorization of the information system; (ii) the specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls; (iii) the importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., the direct or indirect effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the information system, and hence on the risk exposure of the organization, or ability of the organization to perform its mission or business functions); and (iv) the organization’s proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions, allocation of risk mitigation resources).  A risk assessment guides the prioritization process for items included in the plan of action and milestones. References:  OMB Memorandum 02-01; NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-53A. SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE TASK 5-2:  Assemble the security authorization package and submit the package to the authorizing official for adjudication. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information System Security Officer; Security Control Assessor. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The security authorization package contains: (i) the security plan; (ii) the security assessment report; and (iii) the plan of action and milestones.  The information in these key documents is used by authorizing officials to make risk-based authorization decisions.  For information systems inheriting common controls for specific security capabilities, the security authorization package for the common controls or a reference to such documentation is also included in the authorization package.  When security controls are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization ensures that the information needed for authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions, is made available by the provider. Additional information can be included in the security authorization package at the request of the authorizing official carrying out the authorization action.  The contents of the security authorization package are protected appropriately in accordance with federal and organizational policies.  Organizations are strongly encouraged to use automated support tools in preparing and managing the content of the security authorization package to help provide an effective vehicle Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 35 for maintaining and updating information for authorizing officials regarding the ongoing security status of information systems within the organization.  Providing orderly, disciplined, and timely updates to the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones on an ongoing basis, supports the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing authorization.  It also facilitates more cost-effective and meaningful reauthorization actions, if required.  Organizations maintain strict version control as key documents in the authorization package are updated.  With the use of automated tools and supporting databases, authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization are able to maintain awareness with regard to the security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.

RISK DETERMINATION TASK 5-3:  Determine the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Primary Responsibility:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Senior Information Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The authorizing official or designated representative, in collaboration with the senior information security officer, assesses the information provided by the information system owner or common control provider regarding the current security state of the system or the common controls inherited by the system and the recommendations for addressing any residual risks.  Risk assessments (either formal or informal) are employed at the discretion of the organization to provide needed information on threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts as well as the analyses for the risk mitigation recommendations.  The risk executive (function) also provides information to the authorizing official that is considered in the final determination of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use of the information system.  Risk-related information includes the criticality of organizational missions and/or business functions supported by the information system and the risk management strategy for the organization.  The risk management strategy typically describes: (i) how risk is assessed within the organization (i.e., tools, techniques, procedures, and methodologies); (ii) how assessed risks are evaluated with regard to severity or criticality; (iii) known existing aggregated risks from organizational information systems and other sources; (iv) risk mitigation approaches; (v) organizational risk tolerance; and (vi) how risk is monitored over time.  When making the final risk determination, the authorizing official or designated representative considers information obtained from the risk executive (function) and the information provided by the information system owner or common control provider in the security authorization package (i.e., security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones).  Conversely, information system-related security risk information derived from the execution of the RMF is available to the risk executive (function) for use in formulating and updating the organization-wide risk management strategy. References:  NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-39. RISK ACCEPTANCE TASK 5-4:  Determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is acceptable. Primary Responsibility:  Authorizing Official. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Implementation. Supplemental Guidance:  The explicit acceptance of risk is the responsibility of the authorizing official and cannot be delegated to other officials within the organization.  The authorizing official considers many factors when deciding if the risk to organizational operations (including mission, function, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, is acceptable.  Balancing security considerations with mission and operational needs is paramount to achieving an acceptable authorization decision.  The authorizing official issues an authorization decision for the information system and the common controls inherited by the system after reviewing all of the relevant information and, where appropriate, consulting with other organizational officials, including the organization’s risk executive (function).  Security authorization decisions are based on the content of the security authorization package and, where appropriate, any inputs received from key organizational officials, including the risk Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 36 executive (function).  The authorization package provides relevant information on the security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of the security controls employed within or inherited by the system.  Inputs from the risk executive (function), including previously established overarching risk guidance to authorizing officials, provide additional organization-wide information to the authorizing official that may be relevant and affect the authorization decision (e.g., organizational risk tolerance, specific mission and business requirements, dependencies among information systems, and other types of risks not directly associated with the information system).  Risk executive (function) inputs are documented and become part of the security authorization decision.  Security authorization decisions, including inputs from the risk executive (function), are conveyed to information system owners and common control providers and made available to interested parties within the organization (e.g., information system owners and authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information officers, information owners/stewards, senior managers). The authorization decision document conveys the final security authorization decision from the authorizing official to the information system owner or common control provider, and other organizational officials, as appropriate.  The authorization decision document contains the following information: (i) authorization decision; (ii) terms and conditions for the authorization; and (iii) authorization termination date.  The security authorization decision indicates to the information system owner whether the system is: (i) authorized to operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate.  The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any specific limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system or inherited controls that must be followed by the system owner or common control provider.  The authorization termination date, established by the authorizing official, indicates when the security authorization expires.  Organizations may choose to eliminate the authorization termination date if the continuous monitoring program is sufficiently robust to provide the authorizing official with the needed information to conduct ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance activities with regard to the security state of the information system and the ongoing effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the system.   Authorization termination dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational policies which may establish maximum authorization periods.  For example, if the maximum authorization period for an information system is three years, then an organization establishes a continuous monitoring strategy for assessing a subset of the security controls employed within and inherited by the system during the authorization period.  This strategy allows all security controls designated in the respective security plans to be assessed at least one time by the end of the three-year period.  This also includes any common controls deployed external to organizational information systems.  If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified assessors with the required degree of independence based on federal/organizational policies, appropriate security standards and guidelines, and the needs of the authorizing official, the assessment results can be cumulatively applied to the reauthorization, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization.  Organizational policies regarding ongoing authorization and formal reauthorization, if/when required, are consistent with federal directives, regulations, and/or policies. The authorization decision document is attached to the original security authorization package containing the supporting documentation and transmitted to the information system owner or common control provider.  Upon receipt of the authorization decision document and original authorization package, the information system owner or common control provider acknowledges and implements the terms and conditions of the authorization and notifies the authorizing official.  The organization ensures that authorization documents for both information systems and for common controls are made available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, risk executive (function), chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system security officers).  Authorization documents, especially information dealing with information system vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately protected in accordance with federal and organizational policies; and (ii) retained in accordance with the organization’s record retention policy.  The authorizing official verifies, on an ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the information system owner or common control provider.

Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems are in a constant state of change with upgrades to hardware, software, or firmware and modifications to the surrounding environments where the systems reside and operate.  A disciplined and structured approach to managing, controlling, and documenting changes to an information system or its environment of operation is an essential element of an effective security control monitoring program.  Strict configuration management and control processes are established by the organization to support such monitoring activities.  It is important to record any relevant information about specific changes to hardware, software, or firmware such as version or release numbers, descriptions of new or modified features/capabilities, and security implementation guidance.  It is also important to record any changes to the environment of operation for the information system (e.g., modifications to hosting networks and facilities, mission/business use of the system, threats), or changes to the organizational risk management strategy.  The information system owner and common control provider use this information in assessing the potential security impact of the changes.  Documenting proposed or actual changes to an information system or its environment of operation and subsequently assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security state of the system or the organization is an important aspect of security control monitoring and maintaining the security authorization over time.  Information system changes are generally not undertaken prior to assessing the security impact of such changes.  Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation when managing changes to the information system or its environment of operation. Security impact analysis conducted by the organization, determines the extent to which proposed or actual changes to the information system or its environment of operation can affect or have affected the security state of the system.  Changes to the information system or its environment of operation may affect the security controls currently in place (including system-specific, hybrid, and common controls), produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously.  If the results of the security impact analysis indicate that the proposed or actual changes can affect or have affected the security state of the system, corrective actions are initiated and appropriate documents revised and updated (e.g., the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones).  The information system owner or common control provider consults with appropriate organizational officials/entities (e.g., configuration control board, senior information security officer, information system security officer) prior to implementing any security-related changes to the information system or its environment of operation.  The authorizing official or designated representative uses the revised and updated security assessment report in collaboration with the senior information security officer and risk executive (function) to determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary.  Most routine changes to an information system or its environment of operation can be handled by the organization’s continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization and near real-time risk management.  Conducting security impact analyses is part of an ongoing assessment of risk.  The authorizing official or designated representative, in collaboration with the risk executive (function), confirms as needed, determinations of residual risk. The risk executive (function) notifies the authorizing official of any significant changes in the organizational risk posture. References:  NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-53A. ONGOING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS TASK 6-2:  Assess a selected subset of the technical, management, and operational security controls employed within and inherited by the information system in accordance with the organization-defined monitoring strategy. Primary Responsibility:  Security Control Assessor. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 39 Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations assess all security controls employed within and inherited by the information system during the initial security authorization.  Subsequent to the initial authorization, the organization assesses a subset of the security controls (including management, operational, and technical controls) on an ongoing basis during continuous monitoring.  The selection of appropriate security controls to monitor and the frequency of monitoring are based on the monitoring strategy developed by the information system owner or common control provider and approved by the authorizing official and senior information security officer.  For ongoing security control assessments, assessors have the required degree of independence as determined by the authorizing official (see Appendix D.13 and Appendix F.4).  Security control assessments in support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors.  Assessor independence during continuous monitoring, although not mandated, introduces efficiencies into the process and allows for reuse of assessment results when reauthorization is required.  Organizations can use the current year’s assessment results to meet the annual FISMA security control assessment requirement.  To satisfy this requirement, organizations can draw upon the assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security control assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization, ongoing authorization, or formal reauthorization, if required; (ii) continuous monitoring activities; or (iii) testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the system development life cycle process or audit (provided that the testing, evaluation, or audit results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained by assessors with the required degree of independence).  Existing security assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed.  Reuse of assessment information is critical in achieving a cost-effective, fully integrated security program capable of producing the needed evidence to determine the security status of the information system.  The use of automation to support security control assessments facilitates a greater frequency and volume of assessments that is consistent with the monitoring strategy established by the organization.

ONGOING REMEDIATION ACTIONS TASK 6-3:   Conduct remediation actions based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities, assessment of risk, and outstanding items in the plan of action and milestones. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer; Security Control Assessor. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Supplemental Guidance:  The assessment information produced by an assessor during continuous monitoring is provided to the information system owner and common control provider in an updated security assessment report.  The information system owner and common control provider initiate remediation actions on outstanding items listed in the plan of actions and milestones and findings produced during the ongoing monitoring of security controls.  The security control assessor may provide recommendations as to appropriate remediation actions.  An assessment of risk (either formal or informal) informs organizational decisions with regard to conducting ongoing remediation actions.  Security controls that are modified, enhanced, or added during the continuous monitoring process are reassessed by the assessor to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken to eliminate weaknesses or deficiencies or to mitigate the identified risk.

KEY UPDATES TASK 6-4:  Update the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones based on the results of the continuous monitoring process. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Supplemental Guidance:  To facilitate the near real-time management of risk associated with the operation and use of the information system, the organization updates the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones on an ongoing basis.  The updated security plan reflects any modifications to security controls based on risk mitigation activities carried out by the information system owner or common control provider.  The updated security assessment report reflects additional assessment activities carried out to determine security control effectiveness based Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 40 on modifications to the security plan and deployed controls.  The updated plan of action and milestones: (i) reports progress made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan; (ii) addresses vulnerabilities discovered during the security impact analysis or security control monitoring; and (iii) describes how the information system owner or common control provider intends to address those vulnerabilities.  The information provided by these key updates helps to raise awareness of the current security state of the information system (and the common controls inherited by the system) thereby supporting the process of ongoing authorization and near real-time risk management. The frequency of updates to risk management-related information is at the discretion of the information system owner, common control provider, and authorizing officials in accordance with federal and organizational policies.  Updates to information regarding the security state of the information system (and common controls inherited by the system) are accurate and timely since the information provided influences ongoing security-related actions and decisions by authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization.  With the use of automated support tools and effective organization-wide security program management practices, authorizing officials are able to readily access the current security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.  This facilitates near real-time management of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and provides essential information for continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization. When updating key information in security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones, organizations ensure that the original information needed for oversight, management, and auditing purposes is not modified or destroyed.  Providing an effective method of tracking changes to information over time through strict configuration management and control procedures (including version control) is necessary to: (i) achieve transparency in the information security activities of the organization; (ii) obtain individual accountability for security-related actions; and (iii) better understand emerging trends in the organization’s information security program.  References:  NIST Special Publication 800-53A. SECURITY STATUS REPORTING TASK 6-5:   Report the security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the system) to the authorizing official and other appropriate organizational officials on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner or Common Control Provider. Supporting Roles:  Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Supplemental Guidance:  The results of monitoring activities are recorded and reported to the authorizing official on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy.  Security status reporting can be: (i) event-driven (e.g., when the information system or its environment of operation changes or the system is compromised or breached); (ii) time-driven (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly); or (iii) both (event- and time-driven).  Security status reports provide the authorizing official and other senior leaders within the organization, essential information with regard to the security state of the information system including the effectiveness of deployed security controls.  Security status reports describe the ongoing monitoring activities employed by the information system owner or common control provider.  Security status reports also address vulnerabilities in the information system and its environment of operation discovered during the security control assessment, security impact analysis, and security control monitoring and how the information system owner or common control provider intends to address those vulnerabilities.  Organizations have significant latitude and flexibility in the breadth, depth, and formality of security status reports.  Security status reports can take whatever form the organization deems most appropriate.  The goal is cost-effective and efficient ongoing communication with senior leaders conveying the current security state of the information system and its environment of operation with regard to organizational missions and business functions.  At a minimum, security status reports summarize key changes to security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones.  Use of automated management tools facilitates the effectiveness and timeliness of security status reporting.  The frequency of security status reports is at the discretion of the organization and in accordance with federal and organizational policies.  Status reports occur at appropriate intervals to transmit significant security-related information about the information system (including information regarding the ongoing effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the system), but not so frequently as to generate unnecessary work.  The authorizing official uses the security status reports in collaboration with the senior information security officer and risk executive (function) to determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary.  Security status reports are appropriately marked, protected, and handled in accordance with federal and organizational policies.  At the discretion of the organization, security status reports can be used to help satisfy FISMA reporting requirements for documenting remedial actions for any security-related weaknesses or deficiencies.  Note that this status reporting is intended to be ongoing, not to be interpreted as requiring Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                 A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 3  PAGE 41 the time, expense, and formality associated with the information provided for the initial approval to operate.  Rather, the reporting is conducted in the most cost-effective manner consistent with achieving the reporting objectives. References:  NIST Special Publication 800-53A. ONGOING RISK DETERMINATION AND ACCEPTANCE TASK 6-6:  Review the reported security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the system) on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy to determine whether the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation remains acceptable. Primary Responsibility:  Authorizing Official. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Operation/Maintenance. Supplemental Guidance:  The authorizing official or designated representative reviews the reported security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of deployed security controls) on an ongoing basis, to determine the current risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.  The authorizing official determines, with inputs as appropriate from the authorizing official designated representative, senior information security officer, and the risk executive (function), whether the current risk is acceptable and forwards appropriate direction to the information system owner or common control provider.  The use of automated support tools to capture, organize, quantify, visually display, and maintain security status information promotes the concept of near real-time risk management regarding the overall risk posture of the organization.  The use of metrics and dashboards increases an organization’s ability to make risk-based decisions by consolidating data from automated tools and providing it to decision makers at different levels within the organization in an easy-to-understand format.  The risks being incurred may change over time based on the information provided in the security status reports.  Determining how the changing conditions affect the mission or business risks associated with the information system is essential for maintaining adequate security.  By carrying out ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance, authorizing officials can maintain the security authorization over time.  Formal reauthorization actions, if required, occur only in accordance with federal or organizational policies.  The authorizing official conveys updated risk determination and acceptance results to the risk executive (function). References:  NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-39. INFORMATION SYSTEM REMOVAL AND DECOMMISSIONING TASK 6-7:  Implement an information system decommissioning strategy, when needed, which executes required actions when a system is removed from service. Primary Responsibility:  Information System Owner. Supporting Roles:  Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer. System Development Life Cycle Phase:  Disposal. Supplemental Guidance:  When a federal information system is removed from operation, a number of risk management-related actions are required.  Organizations ensure that all security controls addressing information system removal and decommissioning (e.g., media sanitization, configuration management and control) are implemented.  Organizational tracking and management systems (including inventory systems) are updated to indicate the specific information system components that are being removed from service.  Security status reports reflect the new status of the information system.  Users and application owners hosted on the decommissioned information system are notified as appropriate, and any security control inheritance relationships are reviewed and assessed for impact.  This task also applies to subsystems that are removed from information systems or decommissioned.  The effects of the subsystem removal or decommissioning are assessed with respect to the overall operation of the information system where the subsystem resided, or in the case of dynamic subsystems, the information systems where the subsystems were actively employed.

The application of the Risk Management Framework described in this publication is flexible, allowing organizations to effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective organizational structures to best manage information system-related security risks.  Many risk management roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the routine system development life cycle processes carried out by organizations.  Whenever possible, organizations align the risk management roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the system development life cycle.49 D.1   HEAD OF AGENCY (CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) The head of agency (or chief executive officer) is the highest-level senior official or executive within an organization with the overall responsibility to provide information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm (i.e., impact) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of: (i) information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; and (ii) information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency.  Agency heads are also responsible for ensuring that: (i) information security management processes are integrated with strategic and operational planning processes; (ii) senior officials within the organization provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets under their control; and (iii) the organization has trained personnel sufficient to assist in complying with the information security requirements in related legislation, policies, directives, instructions, standards, and guidelines.  Through the development and implementation of strong policies, the head of agency establishes the organizational commitment to information security and the actions required to effectively manage risk and protect the core missions and business functions being carried out by the organization.  The head of agency establishes appropriate accountability for information security and provides active support and oversight of monitoring and improvement for the information security program.  Senior leadership commitment to information security establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a climate for mission and business success.                                                    47 Organizations may define other roles (e.g., facilities manager, human resources manager, systems administrator) to support the risk management process. 48 Caution is exercised when one individual fills multiples roles in the risk management process to ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of interest. 49 For example, the system development life cycle role of system developer or program manager can be aligned with information system owner; mission owner/manager can be aligned with authorizing official; and system/software engineers are complementary roles to information system security engineers. T Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-2 D.2   RISK EXECUTIVE (FUNCTION) The risk executive (function) is an individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure that: (i) risk-related considerations for individual information systems, to include authorization decisions, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and (ii) managing information system-related security risks is consistent across the organization, reflects organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks in order to ensure mission/business success.  The risk executive (function) coordinates with the senior leadership of an organization to: • Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing risk—an approach that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the organization; • Develop a risk management strategy for the organization providing a strategic view of information security-related risks with regard to the organization as a whole;50 • Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization; • Provide oversight for all risk management-related activities across the organization (e.g., security categorizations) to help ensure consistent and effective risk acceptance decisions; • Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business success; • Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including aggregated risk) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; • Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include authorization actions requiring shared responsibility; • Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business functions using external providers of information and services receives the needed visibility and is elevated to the appropriate decision-making authorities; and • Identify the organizational risk posture based on the aggregated risk to information from the operation and use of the information systems for which the organization is responsible. The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization.  The head of the agency/organization may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function to another official or group (e.g., an executive leadership council).  The risk executive (function) has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only. D.3   CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER The chief information officer51 is an organizational official responsible for: (i) designating a senior information security officer;  (ii) developing and maintaining information security policies,                                                  50 Authorizing officials may have narrow or localized perspectives in rendering authorization decisions, in some cases without fully understanding or explicitly accepting the risks being incurred from such decisions.  51 When an organization has not designated a formal chief information officer position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities to be handled by a comparable organizational official. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-3 procedures, and control techniques to address all applicable requirements;  (iii) overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security and ensuring that the personnel are adequately trained; (iv) assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security responsibilities; and (v) in coordination with other senior officials, reporting annually to the head of the federal agency on the overall effectiveness of the organization’s information security program, including progress of remedial actions.  The chief information officer, with the support of the risk executive (function) and the senior information security officer, works closely with authorizing officials and their designated representatives to help ensure that: • An organization-wide information security program is effectively implemented resulting in adequate security for all organizational information systems and environments of operation for those systems; • Information security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting cycles, enterprise architectures, and acquisition/system development life cycles; • Information systems are covered by approved security plans and are authorized to operate; • Information security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and • There is centralized reporting of appropriate information security-related activities. The chief information officer and authorizing officials also determine, based on organizational priorities, the appropriate allocation of resources dedicated to the protection of the information systems supporting the organization's missions and business functions.  For selected information systems, the chief information officer may be designated as an authorizing official or a co-authorizing official with other senior organizational officials.  The role of chief information officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only. D.4   INFORMATION OWNER/STEWARD The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, or operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the policies and procedures governing its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal.52  In information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules of behavior) and retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or provided to other organizations.  The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or transmitted by an information system may or may not be the same as the system owner.  A single information system may contain information from multiple information owners/stewards.  Information owners/stewards provide input to information system owners regarding the security requirements and security controls for the systems where the information is processed, stored, or transmitted.                                                   52 Federal information is an asset of the Nation, not of a particular federal agency or its subordinate organizations.  In that spirit, many federal agencies are developing policies, procedures, processes, and training needed to end the practice of information ownership and implement the practice of information stewardship.  Information stewardship is the careful and responsible management of federal information belonging to the Nation as a whole, regardless of the entity or source that may have originated, created, or compiled the information.  Information stewards provide maximum access to federal information to elements of the federal government and its customers, balanced by the obligation to protect the information in accordance with the provisions of FISMA and any associated security-related federal policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-4 D.5   SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER The senior information security officer is an organizational official responsible for: (i) carrying out the chief information officer security responsibilities under FISMA; and (ii) serving as the primary liaison for the chief information officer to the organization’s authorizing officials, information system owners, common control providers, and information system security officers.  The senior information security officer: (i) possesses professional qualifications, including training and experience, required to administer the information security program functions; (ii) maintains information security duties as a primary responsibility; and (iii) heads an office with the mission and resources to assist the organization in achieving more secure information and information systems in accordance with the requirements in FISMA.  The senior information security officer (or supporting staff members) may also serve as authorizing official designated representatives or security control assessors.  The role of senior information security officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only. D.6   AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL The authorizing official is a senior official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.53  Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for an information system or are responsible for the mission and/or business operations supported by the system.  Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system operations.  Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related security risks.  Authorizing officials also approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or understanding, and plans of action and milestones and determine whether significant changes in the information systems or environments of operation require reauthorization.  Authorizing officials can deny authorization to operate an information system or if the system is operational, halt operations, if unacceptable risks exist.  Authorizing officials coordinate their activities with the risk executive (function), chief information officer, senior information security officer, common control providers, information system owners, information system security officers, security control assessors, and other interested parties during the security authorization process.  With the increasing complexity of missions/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the use of external/shared services, it is possible that a particular information system may involve multiple authorizing officials.  If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials and documented in the security plan.  Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that all activities and functions associated with security authorization that are delegated to authorizing official designated representatives are carried out.  The role of authorizing official has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only. D.7   AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE The authorizing official designated representative is an organizational official that acts on behalf of an authorizing official to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities associated with the security authorization process.  Authorizing official designated representatives can be empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and resourcing of the security authorization process, approval of the security plan, approval and monitoring the implementation of plans of action and milestones, and the assessment and/or                                                  53 The responsibility of authorizing officials described in FIPS 200, was extended in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to include risks to other organizations and the Nation. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-5 determination of risk.  The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the final authorization package, obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the authorization decision document, and transmit the authorization package to appropriate organizational officials.  The only activity that cannot be delegated to the designated representative by the authorizing official is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e., the acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation). D.8   COMMON CONTROL PROVIDER The common control provider is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by information systems).54  Common control providers are responsible for: (i) documenting the organization-identified common controls in a security plan (or equivalent document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that required assessments of common controls are carried out by qualified assessors with an appropriate level of independence defined by the organization; (iii) documenting assessment findings in a security assessment report; and (iv) producing a plan of action and milestones for all controls having weaknesses or deficiencies.  Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a summary of such information) is made available to information system owners inheriting those controls after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or executive with oversight responsibility for those controls. D.9   INFORMATION SYSTEM OWNER The information system owner is an organizational official responsible for the procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and disposal of an information system.55  The information system owner is responsible for addressing the operational interests of the user community (i.e., users who require access to the information system to satisfy mission, business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with information security requirements.  In coordination with the information system security officer, the information system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the security plan and ensures that the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the agreed-upon security controls.  In coordination with the information owner/steward, the information system owner is also responsible for deciding who has access to the system (and with what types of privileges or access rights)56 and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior).  Based on guidance from the authorizing official, the information system owner informs appropriate organizational officials of the need to conduct the security authorization, ensures that the necessary resources are available for the effort, and provides the required information system access, information, and documentation to the security                                                  54 Organizations can have multiple common control providers depending on how information security responsibilities are allocated organization-wide.  Common control providers may also be information system owners when the common controls are resident within an information system.  Common controls are described in Section 2.4. 55 The information system owner serves as the focal point for the information system.  In that capacity, the information system owner serves both as an owner and as the central point of contact between the authorization process and the owners of components of the system including, for example: (i) applications, networking, servers, or workstations; (ii) owners/stewards of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system; and (iii) owners of the missions and business functions supported by the system.  Some organizations may refer to information system owners as program managers or business/asset owners. 56 The responsibility for deciding who has access to specific information within an information system (and with what types of privileges or access rights) may reside with the information owner/steward. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-6 control assessor.  The information system owner receives the security assessment results from the security control assessor.  After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, the information system owner assembles the authorization package and submits the package to the authorizing official or the authorizing official designated representative for adjudication.57  D.10   INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY OFFICER The information system security officer58 is an individual responsible for ensuring that the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system and as such, works in close collaboration with the information system owner.  The information system security officer also serves as a principal advisor on all matters, technical and otherwise, involving the security of an information system.  The information system security officer has the detailed knowledge and expertise required to manage the security aspects of an information system and, in many organizations, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day security operations of a system.  This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to, physical and environmental protection, personnel security, incident handling, and security training and awareness.  The information system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the security policies and procedures and to ensure compliance with those policies and procedures.  In close coordination with the information system owner, the information system security officer often plays an active role in the monitoring of a system and its environment of operation to include developing and updating the security plan, managing and controlling changes to the system, and assessing the security impact of those changes. D.11   INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECT The information security architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for ensuring that the information security requirements necessary to protect the organization’s core missions and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting information systems supporting those missions and business processes.  The information security architect serves as the liaison between the enterprise architect and the information system security engineer and also coordinates with information system owners, common control providers, and information system security officers on the allocation of security controls as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls.  In addition, information security architects, in close coordination with information system security officers, advise authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers, and the risk executive (function), on a range of security-related issues including, for example, establishing information system boundaries, assessing the severity of weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system, plans of action and milestones, risk mitigation approaches, security alerts, and potential adverse effects of identified vulnerabilities.                                                   57 Depending on how the organization has organized its security authorization activities, the authorizing official may choose to designate an individual other than the information system owner to compile and assemble the information for the security authorization package.  In this situation, the designated individual must coordinate the compilation and assembly activities with the information system owner. 58 Organizations may also define an information system security manager or information security manager role with similar responsibilities as an information system security officer or with oversight responsibilities for an information security program.  In these situations, information system security officers may, at the discretion of the organization, report directly to information system security managers or information security managers. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX D   PAGE D-7 D.12   INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY ENGINEER The information system security engineer is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting information system security engineering activities.  Information system security engineering is a process that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures that the requirements are effectively integrated into information technology component products and information systems through purposeful security architecting, design, development, and configuration.  Information system security engineers are an integral part of the development team (e.g., integrated project team) designing and developing organizational information systems or upgrading legacy systems.  Information system security engineers employ best practices when implementing security controls within an information system including software engineering methodologies, system/security engineering principles, secure design, secure architecture, and secure coding techniques.  System security engineers coordinate their security-related activities with information security architects, senior information security officers, information system owners, common control providers, and information system security officers. D.13   SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSOR The security control assessor59 is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the overall effectiveness of the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system).  Security control assessors also provide an assessment of the severity of weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in the information system and its environment of operation and recommend corrective actions to address identified vulnerabilities.  In addition to the above responsibilities, security control assessors prepare the final security assessment report containing the results and findings from the assessment.  Prior to initiating the security control assessment, an assessor conducts an assessment of the security plan to help ensure that the plan provides a set of security controls for the information system that meet the stated security requirements. The required level of assessor independence is determined by the specific conditions of the security control assessment.  For example, when the assessment is conducted in support of an authorization decision or ongoing authorization, the authorizing official makes an explicit determination of the degree of independence required in accordance with federal policies, directives, standards, and guidelines.  Assessor independence is an important factor in: (i) preserving the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment process; (ii) determining the credibility of the security assessment results; and (iii) ensuring that the authorizing official receives the most objective information possible in order to make an informed, risk-based, authorization decision.  The information system owner and common control provider rely on the security expertise and the technical judgment of the assessor to: (i) assess the security controls employed within and inherited by the information system using assessment procedures specified in the security assessment plan; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and address identified vulnerabilities.                                                  59 Security control assessors may be called certification agents in some organizations.  At the discretion of the organization, security control assessors may be given additional duties/responsibilities for the post processing and analysis of security control assessment findings and results.  This may include, for example, making specific determinations for or recommendations to authorizing officials (known in some communities of interest as certification recommendations or certification determinations). Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX E   PAGE E-1 APPENDIX E SUMMARY OF RMF TASKS LISTING OF PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORTING ROLES RMF TASKS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY SUPPORTING ROLES RMF Step 1:  Categorize Information System TASK 1-1 Security Categorization Categorize the information system and document the results of the security categorization in the security plan.

F.1   AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE The security authorization package documents the results of the security control assessment and provides the authorizing official with essential information needed to make a risk-based decision on whether to authorize operation of an information system or a designated set of common controls.  Unless specifically designated otherwise by the chief information officer or authorizing official, the information system owner or common control provider is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and submission of the authorization package.  The information system owner or common control provider receives inputs from the information system security officer, security control assessor, senior information security officer, and risk executive (function) during the preparation of the authorization package.  The authorization package60 contains the following documents: • Security plan; • Security assessment report; and • Plan of action and milestones. The security plan, prepared by the information system owner or common control provider, provides an overview of the security requirements and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.  The plan provides sufficient information to understand the intended or actual implementation of each security control employed within or inherited by the information system.61  The security plan also contains as supporting appendices or as references to appropriate sources, other risk and security-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security configurations, configuration management plan, incident response plan, and continuous monitoring strategy.  In accordance with the near real-time risk management objectives of the security authorization process, the security plan is updated whenever events dictate changes to the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.  Updates to the security plan may be triggered by a variety of events, including for example: (i) a vulnerability scan of the information system or vulnerability assessment of the environment of operation; (ii) new threat information; (iii) weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in currently deployed security controls                                                  60 The authorizing official determines what additional supporting documentation or references may be required to be included in the security authorization package.  Appropriate measures are employed to protect information contained in security authorization packages in accordance with federal and organizational policy. 61 The security plan is a conceptual body of information which may be accounted for within one or more repositories and include documents (electronic or hard copy) that come from a variety of sources produced throughout the system development life cycle.  For example, information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the security plans of common control providers. T Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-2 after an information system breach; (iv) a redefinition of mission priorities or business objectives invalidating the results of the previous security categorization process; and (v) a change in the information system (e.g., adding new hardware, software, or firmware; establishing new connections) or its environment of operation (e.g., moving to a new facility). The security assessment report, prepared by the security control assessor, provides the results of assessing the implementation of the security controls identified in the security plan to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the specified security requirements.  The security assessment report also contains a list of recommended corrective actions for any weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the security controls.62  Supporting the near real-time risk management objectives of the security authorization process, the security assessment report is updated on an ongoing basis whenever changes are made to the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.63  Updates to the security assessment report help to ensure that the information system owner, common control provider, and authorizing officials maintain the appropriate awareness with regard to security control effectiveness.  The overall effectiveness of the security controls directly affects the ultimate security state of the information system and decisions regarding explicit acceptance of risk. The plan of action and milestones, prepared by the information system owner or common control provider, describes the specific measures planned: (i) to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted in the security controls during the assessment; and (ii) to address known vulnerabilities in the information system.64  The content and structure of plans of action and milestones are informed by the organizational risk management strategy developed as part of the risk executive (function) and is consistent with the plans of action and milestones process established by the organization and any specific requirements defined in federal policies, directives, memoranda, or regulations.  The most effective plans of action and milestones contain a robust set of actual weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.  Assuming that most information systems and the environments in which those systems are deployed, have more vulnerabilities than available resources can realistically address, organizations define a strategy for developing and implementing plans of action and milestones that facilitates a prioritized approach to risk mitigation and that is consistent across the organization.  This strategy helps to ensure that plans of action and milestones are based on: • The security categorization of the information system;  • The specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls; • The importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., the direct or indirect effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the information system and hence on the risk exposure65 of the organization);                                                  62 Organizations may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a security control assessment.  An executive summary provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of the security assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls. 63 Organizations maintain strict version control as critical documents in the authorization package are updated. 64 Organizations may choose to document the specific measures implemented to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls in the plan of action and milestones, thereby providing an historical record of actions completed. 65 In general, risk exposure is the degree to which an organization is threatened by the potential adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-3 • The organization’s proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions, allocation of risk mitigation resources); and • The organization’s rationale for accepting certain weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls.66 Organizational strategies for plans of action and milestones are guided by the security categories of the respective information systems affected by the risk mitigation activities.  Organizations may decide, for example, to allocate the vast majority of risk mitigation resources initially to the highest-impact information systems because a failure to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies in those systems could potentially have the most significant adverse effects on the organization’s missions or business operations.  Organizations also prioritize weaknesses or deficiencies using information from organizational assessments of risk and the risk management strategy developed as part of the risk executive (function).  Therefore, a high-impact system would have a prioritized list of weaknesses or deficiencies for that system, as would moderate-impact and low-impact systems.  In general, the plan of action and milestones strategy always addresses the highest-priority weaknesses or deficiencies within those prioritized systems. After completion of the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones, the information system owner or common control provider submits the final security authorization package to the authorizing official or designated representative.  Figure F-1 illustrates the key sections of the authorization package.              FIGURE F-1:   SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE F.2   AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS Authorization decisions are based on the content of the authorization package including inputs from the organization’s risk executive (function) and any additional supporting documentation required by the authorizing official.  The security authorization package provides comprehensive information on the security state of the information system.  Risk executive (function) inputs, including the previously established overarching risk guidance derived from the risk management strategy, provide additional information to the authorizing official that may be relevant and affect the final authorization decision (e.g., organizational risk tolerance, organization’s overall risk mitigation strategy, core mission and business requirements, dependencies among information                                                  66 Organizations document their rationale for accepting security control weakness or deficiencies.

Risk executive (function) inputs are documented and become part of the authorization decision.  Organizations determine how the risk management strategy and risk-related guidance from the risk executive (function) influences/impacts the authorization decisions of authorizing officials.  Security authorization decisions are conveyed to information system owners and common control providers and are made available to selected officials within the organization (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information officers, senior information security officers, information owners/stewards).  There are two types of authorization decisions that can be rendered by authorizing officials: • Authorization to operate;67 and • Denial of authorization to operate. Authorization to Operate If the authorizing official, after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs provided by the risk executive (function), deems that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is acceptable, an authorization to operate is issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational information systems.  The information system is authorized to operate for a specified time period in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the authorizing official.68   For common control providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the common controls under their control are approved for inheritance by organizational information systems.  An authorization termination date is also established by the authorizing official as a condition of authorization.  The authorization termination date can be adjusted by the authorizing official to reflect an increased level of concern regarding the security state of the information system including the security control employed within or inherited by the system.  Authorization termination dates do not exceed the maximum allowable time periods for authorization established by federal or organizational policy. The authorizing official takes specific actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities identified during the execution of the Risk Management Framework unless the vulnerabilities have been explicitly accepted as part of the authorization decision.  In addition, the information system owner or common control provider establishes a disciplined, structured, and repeatable process to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the deployed security controls and the progress of any actions taken to correct or eliminate weaknesses or deficiencies.  The plan of action and milestones submitted by the information system owner is used by the authorizing official to monitor the progress in correcting deficiencies and weaknesses noted during the security control assessment.                                                  67 An interim authorization to test is a special type of authorization decision allowing an information system to operate in an operational environment for the express purpose of testing the system with actual operational (i.e., live) data for a specified time period.  An interim authorization to test is granted by an authorizing official only when the operational environment or live data is required to complete specific test objectives. 68 Some organizations may choose to use the term interim authorization to operate to focus attention on the increased risk being accepted by the authorizing official in situations where there are significant weaknesses or deficiencies in the information system, but an overarching mission necessity requires placing the system into operation or continuing its operation. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-5 Denial of Authorization to Operate If the authorizing official, after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs provided by the risk executive (function), deems that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is unacceptable and immediate steps cannot be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, a denial of authorization to operate is issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational information systems.  The information system is not authorized to operate and is not placed into operation.  If the system is currently in operation, all activity is halted.  For common control providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the common controls under their control are not approved for inheritance by organizational information systems.  Failure to receive an authorization to operate indicates that there are major weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.  The authorizing official or designated representative works with the information system owner or common control provider to revise the plan of action and milestones to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to correct the identified weaknesses or deficiencies. A special case of a denial of authorization to operate is an authorization rescission.  Authorizing officials can rescind a previous authorization decision at any time in situations where there is a specific violation of: (i) federal/organizational security policies, directives, regulations, standards, guidance, or practices; or (ii) the terms and conditions of the original authorization.  For example, failure to maintain an effective continuous monitoring program may be grounds for rescinding an authorization decision.  Authorizing officials consult with the risk executive (function) and the senior information security officer before rescinding security authorizations. F.3   AUTHORIZATION DECISION DOCUMENT The authorization decision document transmits the final security authorization decision from the authorizing official to the information system owner or common control provider and other key organizational officials, as appropriate.  The authorization decision document contains the following information: • Authorization decision; • Terms and conditions for the authorization; • Authorization termination date; and • Risk executive (function) input (if provided). The security authorization decision indicates whether the information system is: (i) authorized to operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate.  For common controls, the authorization decision means that the controls are approved for inheritance by organizational information systems.  The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system or the implementation of common controls that must be followed by the system owner or common control provider.  The authorization termination date, established by the authorizing official, indicates when the security authorization expires and reauthorization is required.  An authorizing official designated representative prepares the authorization decision document for the authorizing official with authorization recommendations, as appropriate.  The authorization decision document is attached to the original authorization package and transmitted to the information system owner or common control provider.69                                                  69 Authorization decision documents may be digitally signed to ensure authenticity. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-6 Upon receipt of the authorization decision document and authorization package, the information system owner or common control provider acknowledges and implements the terms and conditions of the authorization and notifies the authorizing official.  The information system owner or common control provider retains the original authorization decision document and authorization package.70  The organization ensures that authorization documents for information systems and for common controls are available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, the risk executive [function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system security officers).  The contents of the security authorization documentation, especially information regarding information system vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately protected in accordance with federal/organizational policy; and (ii) retained in accordance with the organization’s record retention policy.  The authorizing official verifies on an ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the information system owner or common control provider. F.4   ONGOING AUTHORIZATION A robust and comprehensive continuous monitoring71 strategy integrated into the organization’s system development life cycle process, promotes risk management on an ongoing basis and can significantly reduce the resources required for reauthorization, if required.  Using automation and state-of-the-practice tools, techniques, and procedures, risk management can become near real-time with ongoing monitoring of security controls and changes to the information system and its environment of operation.  When monitoring is conducted in accordance with the needs of the authorizing official, that monitoring results in the production of key information needed to determine: (i) the current security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of the security controls employed within and inherited by the system); (ii) the resulting risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and (iii) whether to authorize continued operation of the system or continued use of common controls inherited by organizational information systems. Continuous monitoring also helps to amortize the resource expenditures for reauthorization activities over the authorization period.  The ultimate objective is to achieve a state of ongoing authorization where the authorizing official maintains sufficient knowledge of the current security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of the security controls employed within and inherited by the system) to determine whether continued operation is acceptable based on ongoing risk determinations, and if not, which step or steps in the Risk Management Framework needs to be re-executed in order to adequately mitigate the additional risk.  Formal reauthorization actions are avoided in situations where the continuous monitoring process provides authorizing officials the necessary information to manage the potential risk arising from changes to the information system or its environment of operation.  Organizations maximize the use of status reports and security state information produced during the continuous monitoring process to minimize the level of effort required if a formal reauthorization action is required.  Formal reauthorization actions occur at the discretion of the authorizing official in accordance with federal or organizational policy.  If a formal reauthorization action is required, organizations maximize the use of security and risk-related information produced during the continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization processes currently in effect.                                                    70 Organizations may choose to employ automated tools to support the development, distribution, and archiving of risk management documentation to include artifacts associated with the security authorization process. 71 Continuous monitoring is described in Appendix G. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-7 Reauthorization actions, if initiated, can be either time-driven or event-driven.  Time-driven reauthorizations occur when the authorization termination date is reached.  Authorization termination dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational policies and by the requirements of authorizing officials which may establish maximum authorization periods.  For example, if the maximum authorization period for an information system is three years, then an organization establishes a continuous monitoring strategy for assessing a subset of the security controls employed within and inherited by the system during the authorization period.  This strategy allows all security controls designated in the respective security plans to be assessed at least one time by the end of the three-year period.  This also includes any common controls deployed external to organizational information systems.  If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified assessors with the required degree of independence based on federal/organizational policies, appropriate security standards and guidelines, and the needs of the authorizing official, the assessment results can be cumulatively applied to the reauthorization, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization.72  The reauthorization action can be as simple as updating the security status information in the authorization package (i.e., the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones).  The authorizing official subsequently signs an updated authorization decision document based on the current determination and acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.73 Unless otherwise handled by continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization, event-driven reauthorizations can occur when there is a significant change to an information system or its environment of operation.  A significant change is defined as a change that is likely to affect the security state of an information system.  Significant changes to an information system may include for example: (i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application; (ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform; (iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or (v) modifications to security controls.  Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include for example: (i) moving to a new facility; (ii) adding new core missions or business functions; (iii) acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a threat source; or (iv) establishing new/modified laws, directives, policies, or regulations.74  If a formal reauthorization action is initiated, the organization targets only the specific security controls affected by the changes and reuses previous assessment results wherever possible.  Most routine changes to an information system or its environment of operation can be handled by the organization’s continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization.  An effective monitoring program can significantly reduce the overall cost and level of effort of reauthorization actions. In the event that there is a change in authorizing officials, the new authorizing official reviews the current authorization decision document, authorization package, and any updated documents created as a result of the ongoing monitoring activities.  If the new authorizing official is willing to accept the currently documented risk, then the official signs a new authorization decision document, thus formally transferring responsibility and accountability for the information system                                                  72 NIST Special Publication 800-53A describes the specific conditions when security-related information can be reused in security authorizations, ongoing authorizations, and reauthorizations. 73 Decisions to initiate a formal reauthorization action include inputs from the risk executive (function) and the senior information security officer. 74 The examples of changes listed above are only significant when they meet the threshold established in the definition of significant change (i.e., a change that is likely to affect the security state of the information system). Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-8 or the common controls inherited by organizational information systems and explicitly accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  If the new authorizing official is not willing to accept the previous authorization results (including identified level of risk), a reauthorization action may need to be initiated or the new authorizing official may instead establish new terms and conditions for continuing the original authorization, but not extend the original authorization termination date.  In all situations where there is a decision to reauthorize an information system or the common controls inherited by organizational information systems, the maximum reuse of authorization information is strongly encouraged to minimize the time and expense associated with the reauthorization effort.75 F.5   TYPE AUTHORIZATION A type authorization is an official authorization decision to employ identical copies of an information system or subsystem (including hardware, software, firmware, and/or applications) in specified environments of operation.76  This form of authorization allows a single authorization package (i.e., security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones) to be developed for an archetype (common) version of an information system that is deployed to multiple locations, along with a set of installation and configuration requirements or operational security needs, that will be assumed by the hosting organization at a specific location.  The type authorization is used in conjunction with the authorization of site-specific controls (e.g., physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls) inherited by the information system.77  The RMF tasks listed in Chapter 3 address the authorization activities associated with the employment of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. F.6   AUTHORIZATION APPROACHES Organizations can choose from three different approaches when planning for and conducting security authorizations to include: (i) an authorization with a single authorizing official; (ii) an authorization with multiple authorizing officials; or (iii) leveraging an existing authorization.78  The first approach is the traditional authorization process defined in this appendix where a single organizational official in a senior leadership position is both responsible and accountable for an information system.  The organizational official also accepts the information system-related security risks that may impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The second approach, or joint authorization, is employed when multiple organizational officials either from the same organization or different organizations, have a shared interest in authorizing an information system.  The organizational officials collectively are responsible and accountable for the information system and jointly accept the information system-related security risks that                                                  75 The decision to initiate a formal reauthorization action can be based on a variety of factors, including for example, the acceptability of the previous authorization information provided in the authorization package, the length of time since the previous authorization decision, the risk tolerance of the new authorizing official, and current organizational requirements and/or priorities. 76 Examples of type authorizations include: (i) an authorization of the hardware and software applications for a standard financial system deployed in several locations around the world; or (ii) an authorization of a common workstation or operating environment (i.e., hardware, operating system, middleware, and applications) deployed to all operating units within an organization. 77 Site-specific controls are typically implemented by an organization as common controls. 78 Authorization approaches can be applied to both information systems and to common controls inherited by one or more organizational information systems. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-9 may adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  A similar authorization process is followed as in the first approach with the essential difference being the addition of multiple authorizing officials.  Organizations choosing a joint authorization approach are expected to work together on the planning and the execution of RMF tasks (see Appendix H) and to document their agreement and progress in implementing the tasks.  Collaborating on the security categorization, selection of security controls, plan for assessing the controls to determine effectiveness, plan of action and milestones, and continuous monitoring strategy, is necessary for a successful joint authorization.  The specific terms and conditions of the joint authorization are established by the participating parties in the joint authorization including for example, the process for ongoing determination and acceptance of risk.  The joint authorization remains in effect only as long as there is mutual agreement among authorizing officials and the authorization meets the requirements established by federal and/or organizational policies. The final approach, leveraged authorization, is employed when a federal agency79 chooses to accept some or all of the information in an existing authorization package generated by another federal agency (hereafter referred to as the owning organization80) based on a need to use the same information resources (e.g., information system and/or services provided by the system).  The leveraging organization reviews the owning organization’s authorization package as the basis for determining risk to the leveraging organization.81  When reviewing the authorization package, the leveraging organization considers risk factors such as the time elapsed since the authorization results were produced, the environment of operation (if different from the environment of operation reflected in the authorization package), the criticality/sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted, as well as the overall risk tolerance of the leveraging organization.  If the leveraging organization determines that there is insufficient information in the authorization package or inadequate security measures in place for establishing an acceptable level of risk, the leveraging organization may negotiate with the owning organization for additional security measures and/or security-related information.82  Additional security measures may include, for example, increasing the number of security controls, conducting additional assessments, implementing compensating controls, or establishing constraints on the use of the information system or services provided by the system.  Security-related information may include, for example, other information that the owning organization may have discerned in the use or assessment of the information system that is not reflected in the authorization package.  The additional security measures and/or security-related information may be provided by the leveraging organization, the information system developer, some other external third party, or some combination of the above. The leveraged authorization approach provides opportunities for significant cost savings and avoids a potentially costly and time-consuming authorization process by the leveraging                                                  79 In this situation, federal agency includes any organizations that are subordinate to the agency.  For example, NIST is a subordinate organization to the Department of Commerce. 80 The term owning organization refers to the federal agency or subordinate organization that owns the authorization package.  The information system may not be owned by the same organization that owns the authorization package, for example, in situations where the system/services are provided by an external provider. 81 The sharing of the authorization package (including the security plan, security assessment report, plan of action and milestones, and authorization decision document) is accomplished under terms and conditions agreed upon by all parties (i.e., the owning organization and the leveraging organization). 82 Negotiations with the owning organization may include other organizations (e.g., when the information system and/or services are provided to the owning organization in full or in part, by an external provider). Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX F   PAGE F-10 organization.  Leveraging organizations generate an authorization decision document and reference, as appropriate, information in the authorization package from the owning organization.  In situations where addition security measures are implemented, the leveraging organization documents those measures by creating an addendum to the original authorization package of the owning organization.  This addendum may include, as appropriate, updates to the security plan, security assessment report, and/or plan of action and milestones.  Consistent with the traditional authorization process described above, a single organizational official in a senior leadership position in the leveraging organization is both responsible and accountable for accepting the information system-related security risks that may impact the leveraging organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.  The leveraged authorization remains in effect as long as the leveraging organization accepts the information system-related security risks and the authorization meets the requirements established by federal and/or organizational policies.  This requires the sharing of information resulting from continuous monitoring activities conducted by the owning organization (e.g., updates to the security plan, security assessment report, plan of action and milestones, and security status reports).  To enhance the security of all parties, the leveraging organization can also share with the owning organization, the results from any RMF-related activities it conducts to supplement the authorization results produced by the owning organization. For all three authorization approaches described above, risk management-related activities (including RMF tasks) involving external providers are carried out in accordance with the guidance provided in Appendices H and I. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX G   PAGE G-1 APPENDIX G CONTINUOUS MONITORING MANAGING AND TRACKING THE SECURITY STATE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS  critical aspect of managing risk to information from the operation and use of information systems involves the continuous monitoring of the security controls employed within or inherited by the system.83  Conducting a thorough point-in-time assessment of the deployed security controls is a necessary but not sufficient condition to demonstrate security due diligence.  An effective organizational information security program also includes a rigorous continuous monitoring program integrated into the system development life cycle.  The objective of the continuous monitoring program is to determine if the set of deployed security controls continue to be effective over time in light of the inevitable changes that occur.  Continuous monitoring is a proven technique to address the security impacts on an information system resulting from changes to the hardware, software, firmware, or operational environment.  A well-designed and well-managed continuous monitoring program can effectively transform an otherwise static security control assessment and risk determination process into a dynamic process that provides essential, near real-time security status-related information to organizational officials in order to take appropriate risk mitigation actions and make cost-effective, risk-based decisions regarding the operation of the information system.  Continuous monitoring programs provide organizations with an effective mechanism to update security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones. G.1   MONITORING STRATEGY Organizations develop a strategy and implement a program for the continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness including the potential need to change or supplement the control set, taking into account any proposed/actual changes to the information system or its environment of operation.  The monitoring program is integrated into the organization’s system development life cycle processes.  A robust continuous monitoring program requires the active involvement of information system owners and common control providers, chief information officers, senior information security officers, and authorizing officials.  The monitoring program allows an organization to: (i) track the security state of an information system on a continuous basis; and (ii) maintain the security authorization for the system over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes.  Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near real-time risk management and represents a significant change in the way security authorization activities have been employed in the past.  Near real-time risk management of information systems can be facilitated by employing automated support tools to execute various steps in the RMF including authorization-related activities.  In addition to vulnerability scanning tools, system and network monitoring tools, and other automated support tools that can help to determine the security state of an information system, organizations can employ automated security management and reporting tools to update key documents in the authorization package including the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones.  The documents in the authorization package are considered “living documents” and updated accordingly based on actual events that may affect the security state of the information system.                                                    83 A continuous monitoring program within an organization involves a different set of activities than Security Incident Monitoring or Security Event Monitoring programs. A Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX G   PAGE G-2 Timeliness is critical for near-real time risk management.  Organizations are encouraged to consolidate available information into measures that can be displayed as trend reports or other types of dashboard visualization to assist decision makers with timely review and decision making.  Transitioning to a near real-time risk management environment will require the increased use of automated support tools over time as organizations integrate these technologies into their information security programs in accordance with available resources. An effective organization-wide continuous monitoring program includes:  • Configuration management and control processes for organizational information systems; • Security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes to organizational information systems and environments of operation;84 • Assessment of selected security controls (including system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) based on the organization-defined continuous monitoring strategy;85 • Security status reporting to appropriate organizational officials;86 and • Active involvement by authorizing officials in the ongoing management of information system-related security risks. With regard to configuration management and control, it is important to document the proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of operation and to subsequently determine the impact of those proposed or actual changes on the overall security state of the system.  Information systems and the environments in which those systems operate are typically in a constant state of change (e.g., upgrading hardware, software, or firmware; redefining the missions and business processes of the organization; discovering new threats).  Documenting information system changes as part of routine SDLC processes and assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security state of the system is an essential aspect of continuous monitoring, maintaining the current authorization, and supporting a decision for reauthorization when appropriate. G.2   SELECTION OF SECURITY CONTROLS FOR MONITORING The criteria for selecting which security controls to monitor and for determining the frequency of such monitoring are established by the information system owner or common control provider in collaboration with the authorizing official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, and risk executive (function).  The selection criteria reflect the organization’s priorities and importance of the information system (or in the case of common                                                  84 Although the primary focus of continuous monitoring activities is on the effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by an information system, there are other equally important external factors in the environment of operation for a system that also require monitoring on an ongoing basis.  These factors include, for example, changes in the organization’s missions or business processes, changes in the threat space, and changes in tolerance for previously accepted risks). 85 Through the use of automation, it is possible to monitor a greater number of security controls on an ongoing basis than is feasible using manual processes.  As a result, organizations may choose to monitor a greater number of security controls with increased frequency. 86 Organizations have significant latitude and flexibility in the breadth, depth, and formality of security status reports.  At a minimum, security status reports describe or summarize key changes to security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones.  At the discretion of the organization, security status reports on information systems can be used to help satisfy the FISMA reporting requirement for documenting remedial actions on any security-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX G   PAGE G-3 controls, the information systems inheriting the controls) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation in accordance with FIPS 199 or CNSS Instruction 1253.  Organizations may use recent risk assessments (including current threat and vulnerability information), history of cyber attacks, results of previous security assessments, and operational requirements in guiding the selection of security controls to be monitored and the frequency of the monitoring process. Priority for security control monitoring is given to the controls that have the greatest volatility and the controls that have been identified in the organization’s plan of action and milestones.  Security control volatility is a measure of how frequently a control is likely to change over time subsequent to its implementation.  For example, security policies and procedures in a particular organization may not be likely to change from one year to the next and thus would likely be security controls with lower volatility.  Access controls or other (technical) security controls that are subject to the direct effects or side effects of frequent changes in hardware, software, and/or firmware components of an information system would, therefore, likely be controls with higher volatility.  Security controls identified in the plan of action and milestones are also a priority in the continuous monitoring process, due to the fact that these controls have been deemed to be ineffective to some degree.  Organizations also consider specific threat information including known attack vectors (i.e., specific vulnerabilities exploited by threat sources) when selecting the set of security controls to monitor and the frequency of such monitoring.  The authorizing official or designated representative approves the set of security controls that are to be monitored on an ongoing basis as well as the frequency of the monitoring activities.   G.3   KEY DOCUMENT UPDATES AND STATUS REPORTING Continuous monitoring results are considered with respect to any necessary updates to the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones, since these documents are used to guide future risk management activities.  Updated security plans reflect any modifications to security controls based on the risk mitigation activities carried out by information system owners or common control providers.  Updated security assessment reports reflect additional assessment activities conducted by assessors to determine security control effectiveness based on modifications to the security plan and deployed controls.  Updated plans of action and milestones: (i) report progress made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan; (ii) address vulnerabilities discovered during the security impact analysis or security control monitoring; and (iii) describe how the information system owner or common control provider intends to address those vulnerabilities.  The results of monitoring activities are reported to authorizing officials on an ongoing basis in the form of status reports.  Other key organizational officials (e.g., risk executive [function], senior information security officer) receive the results of continuous monitoring activities as needed or as requested.  With the use of automated support tools and effective organization-wide security program management practices, authorizing officials have the capability to access the most recent documentation in the authorization package at any time to determine the current security state of the information system, to help manage risk, and to provide essential information for potential reauthorization decisions.  The monitoring of security controls and changes to the information system and its environment of operation, continues throughout the system development life cycle.  Summaries of monitoring results are provided to the senior information security officer and the risk executive (function).Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX H                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    PAGE H-1 APPENDIX H OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS APPLYING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS anaging risk to information from the operation and use of information systems in modern computing environments with a diverse set of potential business relationships can be challenging for organizations.  Relationships are established and maintained in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, lines of business arrangements, interagency and intra-agency agreements), licensing agreements, and supply chain arrangements.87  The Risk Management Framework (RMF) applies only to federal information systems.  There are two distinct types of operational scenarios that affect how organizations address the RMF steps and associated tasks: • Information systems used or operated by federal agencies;88 and • Information systems used or operated by other organizations89on behalf of federal agencies. SCENARIO 1:  For an information system that is used or operated by a federal agency, the system boundary is defined by the agency.  The agency conducts all RMF tasks to include information system authorization.  The agency maintains control over the security controls employed within and inherited by the information system. SCENARIO 2:  For an information system that is used or operated by another organization on behalf of a federal agency, the system boundary is defined by the agency in collaboration with the other organization and one of the following situations applies: - If the organization is contracted to a federal agency, the contractor can conduct all RMF tasks except those tasks which must be carried out by the federal agency as part of its inherent governmental responsibilities.90  The agency provides RMF-related inputs to the contractor, as needed, and maintains strict oversight on all contractor-executed RMF tasks.  The contractor provides appropriate evidence in the security authorization package for the authorization decision by the authorizing official from the federal agency.   - If the organization is a federal agency, the organization can conduct all RMF tasks to include the information system authorization.  The information system authorization can also be a joint authorization if both parties agree to share the authorization responsibilities.  In situations where a federal agency uses or operates an information system on behalf of multiple federal agencies, the joint authorization can include all participating agencies.                                                  87 NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides additional guidance on the application and use of security controls in external environments to include relationships with external service providers. 88 References to federal agencies include organizations that are subordinate to those agencies. 89 Organizations that use or operate an information system on behalf of a federal agency or one of its subordinate organizations can include, for example, other federal agencies or their subordinate organizations, state and local government agencies, contractors, and academic institutions. 90 Organizations ensure that requirements for conducting the specific tasks in the RMF are included in appropriate contractual vehicles, including requirements for independent assessments, when appropriate.

External information system services are services implemented outside of the authorization boundaries established by the organization for its information systems.  These external services may be used by, but are not part of, organizational information systems.  In some situations, external information system services may completely replace the functionality of internal information systems.  Organizations are responsible and accountable for the risk incurred by use of services provided by external providers and address this risk by implementing compensating controls when the risk is greater than the authorizing official or the organization is willing to accept. Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges.  The growing dependence on external service providers and new relationships being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for the organization, especially in the area of information system security.  These challenges include: • Defining the types of external services provided to the organization; • Describing how the external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the organization; and • Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable. FISMA and OMB policy require external providers handling federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same security requirements as federal agencies.  Security requirements for external providers including the security controls for information systems processing, storing, or transmitting federal information are expressed in appropriate contracts or other formal agreements.  Organizations can require external providers to implement all steps in the RMF with the exception of the security authorization step, which remains an inherent federal responsibility that is directly linked to the management of risk related to the use of external information system services.91 The assurance or confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust92 that the organization places in the external service provider.  In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the organization is able to exert on the                                                  91 If the external provider is a federal agency, the provider can conduct all RMF tasks to include the information system authorization (see Appendix H).   92 The level of trust that an organization places in an external service provider can vary widely, ranging from those who are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also competitors in another market sector). O Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    PAGE I-2 external service provider with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of the service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.  The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-level agreement with the external service provider and can range from extensive (e.g., negotiating a contract or agreement that specifies detailed security control requirements for the provider) to very limited (e.g., using a contract or service-level agreement to obtain commodity services93 such as commercial telecommunications services).  In other cases, the level of trust is based on factors that convince the organization that the requisite security controls have been employed and that a determination of control effectiveness exists.  For example, a separately authorized external information system service provided to an organization through a well-established line of business relationship may provide a degree of trust in the external service within the tolerable risk range of the authorizing official. The provision of services by external providers may result in some services without explicit agreements between the organization and the external entities responsible for the services.  Whenever explicit agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements, etc.), the organization develops such agreements and requires the use of the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53.  When the organization is not in a position to require explicit agreements with external providers (e.g., the service is imposed on the organization or the service is commodity service), the organization establishes explicit assumptions about the service capabilities with regard to security.  In situations where an organization is procuring information system services or technologies through a centralized acquisition vehicle (e.g., government-wide contract by the General Services Administration or other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition organization), it may be more efficient and cost-effective for the originator of the contract to establish and maintain a stated level of trust with the external provider (including the definition of required security controls and level of assurance with regard to the provision of such controls).  Organizations subsequently acquiring information system services or technologies from the centralized contract can take advantage of the negotiated trust level established by the procurement originator and thus avoid costly repetition of the activities necessary to establish such trust.94  Contracts and agreements between the organization and external providers may also require the active participation of the organization.  For example, the organization may be required by the contract to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by the service provider. Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official.  Organizations require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information system security.  A chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization.  The chain of trust can be complicated due to the number of                                                  93 Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base.  Therefore, unless organizations obtain fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.  The organization’s risk assessment and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation. 94 For example, a procurement originator could authorize an information system providing external services to the federal government under specific terms and conditions of the contract.  A federal agency requesting information system services under the terms of the contract would not be required to reauthorize the information system when acquiring such services (unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contract). Special Publication 800-37                Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems                A Security Life Cycle Approach ________________________________________________________________________________________________ APPENDIX I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    PAGE I-3 entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the type of relationship between the parties.  External service providers may also in turn outsource the services to other external entities, making the chain of trust even more complicated and difficult to manage.  Depending on the nature of the service, it may simply be unwise for the organization to place significant trust in the provider—not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the provider's part, but due to the intrinsic level of risk in the service.  Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization: (i) employs compensating controls; (ii) accepts a greater degree of risk; or (iii) does not obtain the service (i.e., performs missions or business operations with reduced levels of functionality or possibly no functionality at all). Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices   Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff   Document Issued on: October 2, 2014 The draft of this document was issued on June 14, 2013.

Introduction  The need for effective cybersecurity to assure medical device functionality and safety has become more important with the increasing use of wireless, Internet- and network- connected devices, and the frequent electronic exchange of medical device-related health information.  This guidance has been developed by the FDA to assist industry by identifying issues related to cybersecurity that manufacturers should consider in the design and development of their medical devices as well as in preparing premarket submissions for those devices.  The recommendations contained in this guidance document are intended to supplement FDA’s “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices” (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.htm) and “Guidance to Industry: Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software” (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm077812.htm). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  2  FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.  2. Scope This guidance provides recommendations to consider and information to include in FDA medical device premarket submissions for effective cybersecurity management. Effective cybersecurity management is intended to reduce the risk to patients by decreasing the likelihood that device functionality is intentionally or unintentionally compromised by inadequate cybersecurity.  This guidance document is applicable to the following premarket submissions for devices that contain software (including firmware) or programmable logic as well as software that is a medical device:1 · Premarket Notification (510(k)) including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated · De novo submissions · Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) · Product Development Protocols (PDP) · Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) submissions. 3. Definitions  Asset2 - is anything that has value to an individual or an organization. Authentication - is the act of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device as a prerequisite to allowing access to the device, its data, information, or systems. Authorization - is the right or a permission that is granted to access a device resource. Availability – data, information, and information systems are accessible and usable on a timely basis in the expected manner (i.e. the assurance that information will be available when needed).

Confidentiality provides the assurance that no unauthorized users (i.e. only trusted users) have access to the data, information, or system structures. Cybersecurity - is the process of preventing unauthorized access, modification, misuse or denial of use, or the unauthorized use of information that is stored, accessed, or transferred from a medical device to an external recipient. Encryption - is the cryptographic transformation of data into a form that conceals the data’s original meaning to prevent it from being known or used. Harm3 - is defined as physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment. Integrity – in this document means that data, information and software are accurate and complete and have not been improperly modified. Life-cycle2 – all phases in the life of a medical device, from initial conception to final decommissioning and disposal.  Malware - is software designed with malicious intent to disrupt normal function, gather sensitive information, and/or access other connected systems. Privileged User3 - is a user who is authorized (and, therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.  Risk2 – is the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Risk Analysis2 – is the systematic use of available information to identify hazards and to estimate the risk. 4. General Principles  Manufacturers should develop a set of cybersecurity controls to assure medical device cybersecurity and maintain medical device functionality and safety.   FDA recognizes that medical device security is a shared responsibility between stakeholders, including health care facilities, patients, providers, and manufacturers of medical devices.  Failure to maintain cybersecurity can result in compromised device functionality, loss of data (medical or personal) availability or integrity, or exposure of other connected devices or networks to security threats.  This in turn may have the potential to result in patient illness, injury, or death.                                                             3 As defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  4 Manufacturers should address cybersecurity during the design and development of the medical device, as this can result in more robust and efficient mitigation of patient risks. Manufacturers should establish design inputs for their device related to cybersecurity, and establish a cybersecurity vulnerability and management approach as part of the software validation and risk analysis that is required by 21 CFR 820.30(g).4  The approach should appropriately address the following elements: · Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; · Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end users/patients; · Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited; · Determination of risk levels and suitable mitigation strategies; · Assessment of residual risk and risk acceptance criteria. 5. Cybersecurity Functions  The Agency recommends that medical device manufacturers consider the following cybersecurity framework core functions to guide their cybersecurity activities: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.5  Identify and Protect   Medical devices capable of connecting (wirelessly or hard-wired) to another device, to the Internet or other network, or to portable media (e.g. USB or CD) are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than devices that are not connected.  The extent to which security controls are needed will depend on the device’s intended use, the presence and intent of its electronic data interfaces, its intended environment of use, the type of cybersecurity vulnerabilities present, the likelihood the vulnerability will be exploited (either intentionally or unintentionally), and the probable risk of patient harm due to a cybersecurity breach.   Manufacturers should also carefully consider the balance between cybersecurity safeguards and the usability of the device in its intended environment of use (e.g. home use vs. health care facility use) to ensure that the security controls are appropriate for the intended users.  For example, security controls should not unreasonably hinder access to a device intended to be used during an emergency situation.  The Agency recommends that medical device manufacturers provide justification in the premarket submission for the security functions chosen for their medical devices.                                                            4 21 CFR Part 820 – Quality Systems Regulations: 21 CFR 820.30 Subpart C – Design Controls of the Quality System Regulation. 5 National Institute of Standards and Technology. Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.  Available at: http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/upload/cybersecurity-framework-021214-final.pdf. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  5 Examples of security functions to consider for protection of medical devices should include, but should not be limited to, the following: Limit Access to Trusted Users Only · Limit access to devices through the authentication of users (e.g. user ID and password, smartcard, biometric); · Use automatic timed methods to terminate sessions within the system where appropriate for the use environment; · Where appropriate, employ a layered authorization model by differentiating privileges based on the user role (e.g. caregiver, system administrator) or device role; · Use appropriate authentication (e.g. multi-factor authentication to permit privileged device access to system administrators, service technicians, maintenance personnel); · Strengthen password protection by avoiding “hardcoded” password or common words (i.e. passwords which are the same for each device, difficult to change, and vulnerable to public disclosure) and limit public access to passwords used for privileged device access; · Where appropriate, provide physical locks on devices and their communication ports to minimize tampering; · Require user authentication or other appropriate controls before permitting software or firmware updates, including those affecting the operating system, applications, and anti-malware. Ensure Trusted Content · Restrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code.  One authentication method manufacturers may consider is code signature verification; · Use systematic procedures for authorized users to download version-identifiable software and firmware from the manufacturer; · Ensure capability of secure data transfer to and from the device, and when appropriate, use methods for encryption. Detect, Respond, Recover · Implement features that allow for security compromises to be detected, recognized, logged, timed, and acted upon during normal use; · Develop and provide information to the end user concerning appropriate actions to take upon detection of a cybersecurity event; · Implement device features that protect critical functionality, even when the device’s cybersecurity has been compromised;    · Provide methods for retention and recovery of device configuration by an authenticated privileged user. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  6 Manufacturers may elect to provide an alternative method or approach, with appropriate justification. 6. Cybersecurity Documentation  The type of documentation the Agency recommends you submit in your premarket submission is summarized in this section.  These recommendations are predicated on your effective implementation and management of a quality system in accordance with the Quality System Regulation, including Design Controls. In the premarket submission, manufacturers should provide the following information related to the cybersecurity of their medical device: 1. Hazard analysis, mitigations, and design considerations pertaining to intentional and unintentional cybersecurity risks associated with your device, including: · A specific list of all cybersecurity risks that were considered in the design of your device; · A specific list and justification for all cybersecurity controls that were established for your device. 2. A traceability matrix that links your actual cybersecurity controls to the cybersecurity risks that were considered; 3. A summary describing the plan for providing validated software updates and patches as needed throughout the lifecycle of the medical device to continue to assure its safety and effectiveness.  The FDA typically will not need to review or approve medical device software changes made solely to strengthen cybersecurity.  4. A summary describing controls that are in place to assure that the medical device software will maintain its integrity (e.g. remain free of malware) from the point of origin to the point at which that device leaves the control of the manufacturer; and 5. Device instructions for use and product specifications related to recommended cybersecurity controls appropriate for the intended use environment (e.g. anti-virus software, use of firewall). 7.

International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO 27799 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 215, Health informatics.

Specifically, this International Standard addresses the special information security management needs of the health sector and its unique operating environments. While the protection and security of personal information is important to all individuals, corporations, institutions and governments, there are special requirements in the health sector that need to be met to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, auditability and availability of personal health information. This type of information is regarded by many as being among the most confidential of all types of personal information. Protecting this confidentiality is essential if the privacy of subjects of care is to be maintained. The integrity of health information must be protected to ensure patient safety, and an important component of that protection is ensuring that the information’s entire life cycle be fully auditable. The availability of health information is also critical to effective healthcare delivery. Health informatics systems must meet unique demands to remain operational in the face of natural disasters, system failures and denial-of-service attacks. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information therefore requires health-sector-specific expertise. The need for effective IT security management in healthcare is made all the more urgent by the increasing use of wireless and Internet technologies in healthcare delivery. If not implemented properly, these complex technologies will increase the risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information. Regardless of size, location and model of service delivery, all healthcare organizations need to have stringent controls in place to protect the health information entrusted to them. Yet many health professionals work as solo health providers or in small clinics that lack the dedicated IT resources to manage information security. Healthcare organizations must therefore have clear, concise and healthcare-specific guidance on the selection and implementation of such controls. This guidance must be adaptable to the wide range of sizes, locations, and models of service delivery found in healthcare. Finally, with increasing electronic exchange of personal health information between health professionals, there is a clear benefit in adopting a common reference for information security management in healthcare. ISO/IEC 27002 is already being used extensively for health informatics IT security management through the agency of national or regional guidelines in Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Interest is growing in other countries as well. This International Standard (ISO 27799) draws upon the experience gained in these national endeavours in dealing with the security of personal health information and is intended as a companion document to ISO/IEC 27002. It is not intended to supplant ISO/IEC 27002 or ISO/IEC 27001. Rather, it is a complement to these more generic standards. This International Standard applies ISO/IEC 27002 to the healthcare domain in a way that carefully considers the appropriate application of security controls for the purposes of protecting personal health information. These considerations have, in some cases, led the authors to conclude that application of certain ISO/IEC 27002 control objectives is essential if personal health information is to be adequately protected. This International Standard therefore places constraints upon the application of certain security controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002. This in turn has led to the inclusion in Clause 7 of several normative statements stating that the application of a given security control is mandatory. For example, 7.2.1 states that Organizations processing health information, including personal health information, shall have a written information security policy that is approved by management, published, and then communicated to all employees and relevant external parties.                                                       1) This guideline is consistent with the revised version of ISO/IEC 27002:2005. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) vi © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved In the health domain, it is possible for an organization (a hospital, say) to be certified using ISO/IEC 27001 without requiring certification against, or even acknowledgement of, this International Standard. It is to be hoped, however, that as healthcare organizations strive to improve the security of personal health information, conformance with this International Standard, as a stricter standard for healthcare, will also become widespread. All of the security control objectives described in ISO/IEC 27002 are relevant to health informatics but some controls require additional explanations with regard to how they can be used best to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information. There are also additional health-sector-specific requirements. This International Standard provides additional guidance in a format that persons responsible for health information security can readily understand and adopt. This International Standard's authors do not intend to write a primer on computer security, nor to restate what has already been written in ISO/IEC 27002 or in ISO/IEC 27001. There are many security requirements that are common to all computer-related systems, whether used in financial services, manufacturing, industrial control, or indeed in any other organized endeavour. A concerted effort has been made to focus on security requirements necessitated by the unique challenges of delivering electronic health information that supports the provision of care. Who should read this International Standard? This International Standard is intended for those responsible for overseeing health information security and for healthcare organizations and other custodians of health information seeking guidance on this topic, together with their security advisors, consultants, auditors, vendors and third-party service providers. Benefits of using this International Standard ISO/IEC 27002 is a broad and complex standard and its advice is not tailored specifically to healthcare. This International Standard allows for the implementation of ISO/IEC 27002, within health environments, in a consistent fashion and with particular attention to the unique challenges that the health sector poses. By following it, healthcare organizations help to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of data in their care are maintained, that critical health information systems remain available, and that accountability for health information is upheld. The adoption of this guidance by healthcare organizations both within and among jurisdictions will assist interoperation and enable the safe adoption of new collaborative technologies in the delivery of healthcare. Secure and privacy-protective information sharing can significantly improve healthcare outcomes. As a result of implementing this guidance, healthcare organizations can expect to see the number and severity of their security incidents reduced, allowing resources to be redeployed to productive activities. IT security will thereby allow health resources to be deployed in a cost-effective and productive manner. Indeed, research by the respected Information Security Forum and by market analysts has shown that good all-round security can have as much as a 2 % positive effect upon organizations’ results. Finally, a consistent approach to IT security, understandable by all involved in healthcare, will improve staff morale and increase the trust of the public in the systems that maintain personal health information. How to use this International Standard Readers not already familiar with ISO/IEC 27002 are urged to read the introductory sections of that International Standard before continuing. Implementers of this Intenational Standard (ISO/IEC 27799) must first thoroughly read ISO/IEC 27002, as the text below will frequently refer the reader to the relevant sections of that International Standard. The present document cannot be fully understood without access to the full text of ISO/IEC 27002. General readers not already familiar with health information security and its goals, challenges, and broader context, will benefit from reading a brief introduction, to be found in Clause 5.

No mandatory requirements are contained in this clause. Instead, general advice and guidance are given on how best to proceed with the implementation of 27002 in healthcare. The clause is organized around a cycle of activities (plan/do/check/act) that are described in ISO/IEC 27001 and that, when followed, will lead to a robust implementation of an information security management system. Readers seeking specific advice on the eleven security control clauses and 39 main security control categories described in ISO/IEC 27002 will find it in Clause 7. This clause leads the reader through each of the eleven security control clauses of ISO/IEC 27002. Minimum requirements are stated where appropriate and, in some cases, normative guidelines are set out on the proper application of certain ISO/IEC 27002 security controls to the protection of health information. This International Standard concludes with three informative annexes. Annex A describes the general threats to health information. Annex B briefly describes tasks and related documents of the information security management system. Annex C discusses the advantages of support tools as an aid to implementation. The Bibliography lists related standards in health information security.

This International Standard specifies a set of detailed controls for managing health information security and provides health information security best practice guidelines. By implementing this International Standard, healthcare organizations and other custodians of health information will be able to ensure a minimum requisite level of security that is appropriate to their organization’s circumstances and that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health information. This International Standard applies to health information in all its aspects, whatever form the information takes (words and numbers, sound recordings, drawings, video and medical images), whatever means are used to store it (printing or writing on paper or electronic storage) and whatever means are used to transmit it (by hand, via fax, over computer networks or by post), as the information must always be appropriately protected. This International Standard and ISO/IEC 27002 taken together define what is required in terms of information security in healthcare; they do not define how these requirements are to be met. That is to say, to the fullest extent possible, this International Standard is technology-neutral. Neutrality with respect to implementing technologies is an important feature. Security technology is still undergoing rapid development and the pace of that change is now measured in months rather than years. By contrast, while subject to periodic review, standards are expected on the whole to remain valid for years. Just as importantly, technological neutrality leaves vendors and service providers free to suggest new or developing technologies that meet the necessary requirements that this International Standard describes. As noted in the introduction, familiarity with ISO/IEC 27002 is indispensable for an understanding of this International Standard. 1.2 Scope exclusions The following areas of information security are outside the scope of this International Standard: a) methodologies and statistical tests for effective anonymization of personal health information; b) methodologies for pseudonymization of personal health information (see bibliographic Reference [10] for an example of an ISO Technical Specification that deals specifically with this subject); c) network quality of service and methods for measuring availability of networks used for health informatics; d) data quality (as distinct from data integrity).                                                       2) This guideline is consistent with the revised version of ISO/IEC 27002:2005.

In healthcare, privacy of subjects of care depends upon maintaining the confidentiality of personal health information. To maintain confidentiality, measures must also be taken to maintain the integrity of data, if for no other reason than that it is possible to corrupt the integrity of access control data, audit trails, and other system data in ways that allow breaches in confidentiality to take place or to go unnoticed. In addition, patient safety depends upon maintaining the integrity of personal health information; failure to do this can also result in illness, injury or even death. Likewise, a high level of availability is an especially important attribute of health systems, where treatment is often time-critical. Indeed, disasters that could lead to outages in other non-health-related IT systems may be the very times when the information contained in health systems is most critically needed. Moreover, denial of service attacks against networked systems are increasingly common.

These controls help to prevent errors in medical practice that might ensue from failure to maintain the integrity of health information. In addition, they help to ensure that the continuity of medical services is maintained. There are additional considerations that shape the goals of health information security. They include: a) honouring legislative obligations as expressed in applicable data protection laws and regulations protecting a subject of care's right to privacy3); b) maintaining established privacy and security best practices in health informatics; c) maintaining individual and organizational accountability among health organizations and health professionals; d) supporting the implementation of systematic risk management within health organizations; e) meeting the security needs identified in common healthcare situations; f) reducing operating costs by facilitating the increased use of technology in a safe, secure, and well-managed manner that supports – but does not constrain – current health activities; g) maintaining public trust in health organizations and the information systems these organizations rely upon; h) maintaining professional standards and ethics as established by health-related professional organizations (insofar as information security maintains the confidentiality and integrity of health information); i) operating electronic health information systems in an environment appropriately secured against threats; j) facilitating interoperability among health systems, since health information increasingly flows among organizations and across jurisdictional boundaries (especially as such interoperability enhances the proper handling of health information to ensure its continued confidentiality, integrity and availability). 5.2 Information security within information governance4) In recent years, corporate governance has become a critical issue for organizations of all types, in response to the regulatory drives embodied in initiatives such as the United States’ Sarbanes Oxley Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Basel II Accords, the UK’s Turnbull Code and Germany’s KontraG. Also, the increasing dependence of organizations on information and its supporting technologies makes information governance an important component of operational risk management processes. Many areas of information management, such as accreditation and data protection, can be considered to fall within the scope of information governance. It is vitally important that the scope of information governance embrace and aid the ongoing deployment of information security so that due attention is always paid to confidentiality, integrity and availability. Information security is clearly a critical component enabling the broader aspects of information governance.                                                       3) In addition to legal obligations, a wealth of information is available on ethical obligations relating to health information, e.g. the code of ethics of the World Health Organization. These ethical obligations may also, in certain circumstances, have an impact on health information security policy. 4) Note that in some countries, information governance is referred to as information assurance. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 75.3 Information governance within corporate and clinical governance While health organizations may differ in their positions on clinical governance and corporate governance, the importance of integrating and attending to information governance ought to be beyond debate as a vital support to both. As health organizations become ever more critically dependent on information systems to support care delivery (e.g. by exploiting decision support technologies and trends towards “evidence-based” rather than “experience-based” healthcare), it becomes increasingly evident that events in which losses of integrity, availability and confidentiality occur may have a significant clinical impact and that problems arising from such impacts will be seen to represent failures in the ethical and legal obligations inherent in a “duty of care”. All countries and jurisdictions will undoubtedly have case studies where such breaches have led to misdiagnoses, deaths or protracted recoveries. Clinical governance frameworks therefore need to treat effective information security risk management as equal in importance to care treatment plans, infection management strategies and other “core” clinical management matters. 5.4 Health information to be protected There are several types of information whose confidentiality, integrity and availability5) need to be protected: a) personal health information; b) pseudonymized data derived from personal health information via some methodology for pseudonymous identification; c) statistical and research data, including anonymized data derived from personal health information by removal of personally identifying data; d) clinical/medical knowledge not related to any specific subjects of care, including clinical decision support data (e.g. data on adverse drug reactions); e) data on health professionals, staff and volunteers; f) information related to public health surveillance; g) audit trail data, produced by health information systems that contain personal health information, or pseudonymous data derived from personal health information, or that contain data about the actions of users with regard to personal health information; h) system security data for health information systems, including access control data and other security-related system configuration data for health information systems. The extent to which confidentiality, integrity and availability need to be protected depends upon the nature of the information, the uses to which it is put, and the risks to which it is exposed. For example, statistical data [c) above] may not be confidential, but protecting its integrity may be very important. Likewise, audit trail data [g) above] might not require high availability (frequent archiving with a retrieval time measured in hours rather than seconds might suffice in a given application) but its content might be highly confidential. Risk assessment can properly determine the level of effort needed to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability (see 6.4.4). The results of regular risk assessment must be fitted to the priorities and resources of the implementing organization.                                                       5) Level of availability depends upon the uses to which the data will be put.

While none is truly unique to healthcare, what is unique in healthcare is the array of factors to be considered when assessing threats and vulnerabilities. By their nature, health organizations operate in an environment where visitors and the public at large can never be totally excluded. In large health organizations, the sheer volume of people moving through operational areas is significant. These factors increase the vulnerability of systems to physical threats. The likelihood that such threats will occur may increase when emotional or mentally ill subjects of care or relatives are present. Many health organizations are chronically underfunded and their staff members are sometimes obliged to work under significant stress. This can often result in heightened error rates, including the performance of incorrect procedures. Other consequences of such resource constraints include systems designed, implemented and operated in an overly casual manner or systems kept in service long after they ought to have been retired. These factors can increase the potential for certain types of threat and can exacerbate vulnerabilities. On the other hand, clinical care is still a process that involves a range of professional, technical, administrative, ancillary and voluntary staff, many of whom see their work as a vocation. Their dedication and diversity of experience can often usefully reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. The high level of professional training received by many health professionals also sets healthcare apart from many other industrial sectors in reducing the incidence of insider threats. The critical importance of correctly identifying subjects of care and correctly matching them to their health records leads health organizations to collect detailed identifying information. Regional or jurisdictional patient registries (i.e. registries of subjects of care) are sometimes the most comprehensive and up-to-date repositories of identifying information available in a jurisdiction. This identifying information is of great potential value to those who would use it to commit identity theft and so must be rigorously protected. The health environment, with its unique threats and vulnerabilities, should therefore be considered with special care. Annex A contains an informative list of the types of threat that need to be considered by health organizations when they assess risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information and to the integrity and availability of related information systems. 6 Practical action plan for implementing ISO/IEC 27002 6.1 Taxonomy of the ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards ISO/IEC 27002 provides a standard checklist of control objectives in 11 areas containing a total of 39 main security categories, each with a description of one or more security controls. Implementers of ISO/IEC 27002 in health environments will find that most of the control objectives apply in almost all situations. However, users of the standards in healthcare also need to recognise situations in which additional control objectives may be needed. This is often the case where clinical processes intersect with specialist devices such as scanners, infusion machines, etc., even if the security controls only relate to maintenance of device data integrity. Different jurisdictions will also have different legal frameworks that may change the required scope of compliance activities. ISO/IEC 27001 introduces the concept of an “Information Security Management System (ISMS)” and describes the need for this detailed framework of controls when an effort is made to meet the security objectives revealed as relevant by risk assessment. International experience and recognised information security best practice principles indicate that ongoing compliance with ISO/IEC 27002 can best be ensured by the implementation of a management system as depicted in Figure 1.

A common mistake made, especially by public health organizations where there is typically no central requirement for formal accreditation or certification, is to describe compliance with ISO/IEC 27002 as being a matter of adopting a checklist. To be truly compliant, organizations need to be able to demonstrate an operational ISMS in which there are appropriate compliance auditing processes. This compliance fits well with the regulatory frameworks under which health organizations typically operate. See also 7.12. 6.2 Management commitment to implementing ISO/IEC 27002 It is essential that a health organization have the evident support of management before trying to achieve compliance with ISO/IEC 27002. Clearly, management's active involvement and support are essential for success. That involvement should include written and verbal statements of commitment to the importance of health information security and recognition of its benefits. Risk assessment brings with it the potential for discovering serious risks that, in turn, require substantial changes to existing processes in order for these risks to be mitigated. The personal willingness of management to subject themselves and the organization to changes in processes and to be pioneers of those changes must be clearly shown. Without these steps being taken, the commitment of others will be less than complete. Unnecessary suspicions can be aroused amongst stakeholders about the “real purpose” of the programme (e.g. is it to increase the effectiveness of information security or reduce the number of employees needed?). Furthermore, management must be prepared for the likelihood that the short-term increase in expenditure arising from transition to the new regime is likely, especially in health, to produce negative comment. Such comments may also arise from a mixture of perceptions about the purposes and plans involved. Management's clear dedication can minimize such problems.

This requires pursuing a cycle of activities, as illustrated in Figure 2.   4. Act:  Maintain and improve the ISMS(see 6.7) 2. Do:  Implement & operate the ISMS(see 6.5) 1. Plan:  Establish the ISMS(see 6.4) 3.

However, experience from implementations in the UK and elsewhere has shown that very large units struggle to complete the work involved and to deliver the necessary level of compliance in one attempt. Compliance scopes that cover no more than two to three sites or approximately 50 staff or approximately ten processes have been found to work very well. For this reason, primary care practices, clinics, home visit teams, hospital specialties and directorates, etc., all make effective scopes. An incremental and iterative process is thus typically followed to achieve total coverage and full benefit. The prospects for achieving such results ought not to be undermined by the selection of an overly broad compliance scope. However, where third-party providers of IT services are employed, “Management of IT Services Delivery” has been widely adopted as a scope for compliance, with considerable success. In health organizations, as elsewhere, activity in recent years has successfully moved information security from being a technical or “back-office” function to being a prominent corporate responsibility. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 11In healthcare, the extensive interdependency of functions makes scope definition a challenge. For this reason, it is all the more important to get it right. 6.4.1.2 Criteria for defining the compliance scope To appropriately balance the “deliverability” of compliance with corporate benefit, many public sector organizations, including health organizations, have defined an initial scope of “Secure Delivery of IT Services”. Though related more directly to infrastructure than to business processes, this scope confers real corporate benefits insofar as it accomplishes critical tasks, including securing the infrastructure as a whole, stimulating the implementation of any needed updates to the corporate security processes, and improving identity management, information security awareness and business continuity management. Typically, in many of these areas, corporate benefits over and above the chosen scope will result. It is essential, therefore, that criteria be used to define the scope. The criteria are typically “soft” in nature and cover such topics as: a) the degree of visibility sought; b) the balance of business and technical involvement intended; c) the degree of local or central relevance sought; d) the extent of manageability that the scope will introduce. 6.4.1.3 Potential summary level gap analysis while defining the compliance scope Before making the final selection of a scope, it may be appropriate to undertake a gap analysis on a sampling basis to therefore get a “feel” for how much work different areas may involve before making the final selection. Whether an “easy” or “hard” area is chosen is a matter for the organization to decide, although, logically, commensurately more corporate benefit is to be gained from taking on the “hard” aspects of the scope. 6.4.1.4 Controlled involvement/inclusion of third parties Another typical area in which errors are made is the interpretation of scope. Scope includes the services delivered by third parties and the delivery of required supporting processes, but not a determination of how those supporting processes are delivered. 6.4.1.5 Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and contracts help establish the scope SLAs and contracts can also assist in defining scope inasmuch as these instruments effectively define the scope boundary. Even if they do not do so clearly in some cases, reviewing them will still prove worthwhile for clarifying likely priorities for improvement. 6.4.1.6 Producing and disseminating the scope statement A formal scope statement needs to be produced, especially if certification is sought under ISO/IEC 27001. The statement ought to be publicised widely within the organization. It is essential that the scope statement define the boundary of the compliance activity in terms of people, processes, places, platforms and applications. In the case of health organizations, this statement ought to be publicised widely, reviewed, and adopted by the organization’s information, clinical and corporate governance groups. Indeed, some health organizations are known to have sought comments on the statement from clinicians' professional regulatory bodies, which may be aware of other organizations pursuing compliance or certification. See 7.3.2.1 for minimum requirements relating to scope statements.

Best practice has shown that the focus of this analysis needs to be on organizational responsibility, implementation, documentation of security practices and evidence used to support the analysis. This is clearly consistent with health practices where appropriate skills, records and procedures are all important. A common failure of such analyses is not obtaining comparative viewpoints and corroboration. The analyst risks obtaining comments that could merely reflect the aspirations of certain individuals rather than a coherent view of current practice. Time needs to be taken to interview health professionals and managers to obtain a well-rounded view. The purpose of gap analysis is to provide initial guidance on required improvements, pending detailed evaluation of the risk assessment (see 6.4.5.1) and risk treatment (see 6.4.5.2). Also, gap analysis can suggest an initial priority rating for such improvements. 6.4.3 Establishing or enhancing a health information security forum At the heart of the ISMS, an appropriate Information Security Management Forum (ISMF) must be established to oversee and direct information security. What constitutes “appropriate” in this context varies among organizations and will also vary across the spectrum of healthcare. Structuring the forum will be challenging, with many stakeholders' views to be accommodated and many regulatory obligations to be met. While the functions of the ISMF cannot be devolved or dispersed without losing effectiveness, neither should creation of the ISMF be taken as a mandate to create “yet another committee”. It is usually better to extend the focus of an existing committee, such as one that addresses risks or that undertakes information governance. Membership will need to encompass the full range of information assurance and information governance functions, as well as representatives of the different user communities and representatives of the key support functions. Representatives of Internal Audit and Human Resources are also typically present. The organization’s (virtual or actual) information security officer should, among other duties, report to the forum and provide it with secretariat services, and should also be responsible for collating, publishing and commenting on the reports received by forum members. As described in 5.2 and 5.3, the central nature of information security within information governance makes the positioning of the ISMF within the information governance structure a very sensible arrangement, but only if the latter group is, in turn, linked into the clinical governance structure. Clinical governance deals with patient safety issues and these are often closely related to the health information security issues to which information governance must attend. Taking an information governance approach underscores the critical nature of information security and also allows an integrated process, with risk analysis input, that directly feeds clinical governance. The removal of the “silo” mentality separating information security, data protection, freedom of information, etc. can only help to remove duplicated costs and to provide enhanced assurance of process integrity. 6.4.4 Assessing risks to health information 6.4.4.1 General Risk assessment is the mechanism by which the controls framework that delivers the ISO/IEC 27002 control objectives is to be identified. This process is well documented in ISO/IEC/TR 13335-3. There are a number of special considerations in the health arena that are worthy of discussion. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 136.4.4.2 Role of information security risk assessment in healthcare Healthcare clearly carries relatively high risks, especially in areas such as laboratories, emergency departments and operating theatres. A finding of low risk in the health information activities that support such areas ought therefore to be questioned, although the trap of assuming that every health information activity directly relates to care delivery would be equally wrong. Information security risk assessments in healthcare ought to consider qualitative as well as quantitative factors. Financial losses should not be the primary consideration but may be taken into account where there is evidence of large sums being paid for negligence. Careful design of valuation guidelines relevant to healthcare will be required, e.g. guidelines recognising the importance of patient safety, uninterrupted availability of emergency services, professional accreditation, and clinical regulation. 6.4.4.3 Features of risk assessment with healthcare examples and reference to ISO/IEC 13335 A risk is composed of a causal relationship between several risk sources. Figure 3 shows the relationship between risks and risk sources in ISO/IEC 13335, making it clear that a risk value is determined from the surrounding asset values, threats, and vulnerabilities.

All of these are applicable to healthcare, although “business impact assessment” clearly needs to include the many different health professions. Information security risk assessments performed by health organizations would benefit from following this model.

Without this understanding following the business impact analysis, understanding the failure scenarios that are relevant will be nearly impossible. In the light of the severe impact possible on health organizations, understanding these dependencies is essential. 6.4.4.4 Required skills and contributions Risk analysis cannot typically be delivered by any single individual, except to the extent that the individual may give their personal viewpoints. Rather, it is an activity designed to seek consensus, so that all viewpoints are collected and indeed respected. It is a reality that all individuals have different perspectives and different tolerances for risk. Challenges, even hypothetical and unlikely ones, are likely to be needed to get to the realistic “worst case scenarios” for impacts, threat likelihoods and vulnerabilities. Naturally, actual past incidents are by default realistic but they may not be the worst case. Defining worst cases may well require specialist input. Scenarios with multiple “if” statements, however, are unlikely to be realistic. Health professionals are likely to benefit from the input of IT staff who will be able to identify failure modes and scenarios requiring assessment. Effective information security risk assessment in healthcare requires the availability of the following skills and knowledge: a) clinical and nursing process knowledge, including care protocols and pathways; b) knowledge of the formats of clinical data and the capability for the misuse of this data; c) knowledge of external environment factors that could exacerbate or moderate any or all of the levels of the risk components described previously; d) information on IT and medical device attributes and performance/failure characteristics; e) knowledge of incident histories and actual case impact scenarios; f) detailed knowledge of systems architectures; g) familiarity with change management programmes that would change any or all of the risk component levels. 6.4.4.5 Required outputs ISO/IEC TR 13335-3 defines the following typical outputs: a) risk assessment report; b) risk treatment plan. Additionally, health organizations should also produce: c) asset/dependency models (to support risk assessment); d) status reports on controls; e) risk treatment summary reports (to underpin gap analysis and the statement of applicability). Since healthcare is a sector with significant compliance obligations (both legal and professional) and risk management responsibilities, an output that maps together related risk assessments, performed by different disciplines or functional groups, ought to be considered as an aid to good information governance and also to help ensure the integrity of individual risk assessments.

It should not be an end in itself, but it often ends up that way. This is especially true in environments with resource constraints, such as those found in many health organizations. Risk management responds to the assessment by identifying which controls should be strengthened, which controls are already effectively in place and which additional controls the organization needs to implement in order to reduce the residual level of risk to an acceptable level. The increasing interconnection of health information systems makes risk management in healthcare especially challenging, as few health organizations can act as if their systems were isolated islands of information. Risk assessment in healthcare frequently raises questions about information custodianship, ownership and responsibility. Effective risk management must ensure the alignment of responsibility for information security with the authority to make risk management decisions. 6.4.5.2 Risk treatment To clearly distinguish the risk management process as a whole from the act of managing identified risks, Australian and New Zealand standard AS/NZ 4360 introduced the concept of “risk treatment”. This concept has subsequently been adopted by ISO/IEC 27001. The label “risk treatment” highlights the activity of reducing risk to acceptable levels (recognising that sufficient resources will never be available to allow even a try at complete risk avoidance). Risk treatment is particularly apposite for health organizations, bringing with it as it does the concepts of “treat, transfer or tolerate” in relation to risks. The definition of what is acceptable is, and should remain, individual to the organization and its personnel. It should reflect the organization’s appetite for risk and should be used to ensure that spending on information security improvement is justified and represents a demonstrably good use of scarce financial resources. 6.4.5.3 Risk acceptance criteria Health organizations need to define and document their criteria for the acceptance of risks. The factors to be taken into account are numerous and variable but the following should be considered for inclusion: a) health sector, industry or organizational standards; b) clinical or other priorities; c) cultural fit; d) reactions of subjects of care; e) coherence with IT, clinical, and corporate risk acceptance strategy; f) cost; g) effectiveness; h) type of protection; i) number of threats covered; j) risk level at which the controls become justified; k) risk level that led to the recommendation being made; Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 17l) alternatives already in place; m) additional benefits derived. Taken together, these factors will yield a cost-benefit assessment that can underpin the necessary business case for seeking funding. A decision taken, usually by the ISMF, not to implement a particular control is entirely valid but ought to be formally recorded for periodic review and re-assessment. Health organizations should document accepted risks. 6.4.5.4 Plans for handling outstanding areas of risk The process above should include an agreement about when (although it is acceptable for it to be “never”) the identified risk will be addressed by the implementation of the control(s). Plans for future implementations should be reflected in the organization’s security improvement plan. 6.4.6 Security improvement planning Authority for the security improvement plan should be taken, on behalf of the ISMF, by the organization’s information security officer, data protection officer, or risk manager, or by a similarly responsible officer of the organization. Often formatted as a Gantt chart, the plans should be made available to clinical and other staff, as they are typically not a confidential document. Indeed, they can often be useful in demonstrating progress and process improvement. Such plans will be most effective in minimizing interruptions to operations if they integrate information security improvements with planned changes in IT facilities and healthcare service provision. They also need to recognise known periods of unusual healthcare activity such as the influx of a new batch of interns or trainees. 6.4.7 Statement of applicability A statement of applicability can be seen as an executive summary of the state of information security in the organization, of the organization’s interpretation of security requirements and of its strategy for implementing security solutions. Maintained by the information security officer or similar officer on behalf of the ISMF, this document should be provided to the clinical and corporate governance functions to form a key part of the governance documentation set. Its format is also typically suitable for use as an assessment or evidence tool in support of external auditing, clinical assurance and other regulatory inspections. 6.4.8 ISMS document set The ISMS model shown in 6.1 lists the documentation required (see Figure 1). The essential documents are: a) information security policy of the organization; b) scope statement; c) statement of applicability; d) inventory of information assets and system assets to be protected; e) risk assessment plans and reports; f) procedures and standards agreed upon; g) contractual agreements (including service level agreements and acceptable use agreements). Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 18 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved In addition, the operation of the ISMF and its success in meeting clinical needs and priorities can be materially facilitated if these priorities are documented by the clinical and corporate governance functions and then held by the ISMF as a part of the documentation set. This document then provides backup material in support of risk acceptance decisions taken by the ISMF. Annex B contains the ISMS document set and related documents to the various steps in establishing or enhancing an ISMS. 6.4.9 Potential for facilitation by the use of tools The process of ISO/IEC 27002 compliance involves a range of steps that generate a significant quantity of information and documentation. However, health organizations exist in a dynamic environment in which risks change and new controls are implemented. The overall integrity of this information and documentation therefore needs to be maintained. Furthermore, the staged, compounding, extending and iterative nature of the processes involved means that the information is repeatedly manipulated and re-used in multiple processes, with the results of a later process often requiring amendments to be made in an earlier process. Finally, decisions will typically be taken in the light of a range of factors that will require considerable cross-referencing. Health organizations ought to consider adopting tools to support their ISO/IEC 27002 compliance. Annex C contains an informative discussion of potential benefits and required attributes of such tools. 6.5 Doing: implementing and operating the ISMS Implementing the ISMS involves several steps. a) Creating a risk treatment plan: once risks have been identified through a risk analysis, these risks must be examined and either accepted by senior management or mitigated where the risk is deemed unacceptable. A risk treatment plan clarifies the activities that need to be carried out to reduce unacceptable risks. It includes a plan for implementing the security controls chosen (based on the results of the risk assessment) to reduce or mitigate these unacceptable risks. The ISMF is responsible for ensuring that this plan is carried out. Ideally, a risk treatment plan will include schedules, priorities, and detailed work plans, and will also allocate responsibilities for implementing security controls. In healthcare, approving such plans can involve both information governance and clinical governance functions. b) Allocating resources: an essential role of management is to provide the necessary resources (people, systems and funding) to ensure the security of health information assets. c) Selecting and implementing security controls: Clause 7 reviews each of the eleven security clauses of ISO/IEC 27002 and provides advice and guidance on the appropriate selection of security controls in a health environment. d) Training and educating: 7.5.2.2 discusses the requirements for training and education for all staff, contractors, health professionals and others who access health information systems and personal health information. e) Managing operations: competent ongoing operation of the ISMS is essential if the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information and information systems is to be maintained. Subclause 7.7 discusses health-related aspects of operations management. f) Managing resources: effective information security can be expensive and competent human resources scarce. Effective prioritization by the ISMF and careful management of people and resources are needed to ensure effective ongoing operations. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 19g) Managing security incidents: to minimize the consequences of a security incident, it is important that the incident be detected appropriately and that corrective action be taken. Procedure manuals for dealing with security incidents need to be prepared and regularly reviewed. It is especially important to define responsibilities and action steps in the initial phase of response, as events can unfold quickly and the critical nature of health information systems leaves little time for reflection as a security incident unfolds. Clear reporting procedures for security incidents are also essential so that the trust of healthcare stakeholders is maintained and that those responsible for corporate and clinical governance are apprised of significant events and their consequences. Subclause 7.10 contains a detailed discussion of security incident management. 6.6 Checking: monitoring and reviewing the ISMS 6.6.1 Need for ongoing assurance The organization, the ISMS and, within it, the ISMF will need assurance of its effectiveness both in maintaining the currently delivered level of security and in its continuous improvement in line with the information security strategy, aligned to the organization's goals. A range of options is available for achieving that assurance. These options can be used in combinations. The less expensive options deliver commensurately less assurance, reflecting the limited rigour and independence they offer. Health organizations ought to create compliance auditing programmes that use a combination of technologies and approaches. 6.6.2 Compliance assessment 6.6.2.1 Self-assessment At the most basic level, and especially where the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 is purely for internal purposes, an assessment by a small team from elsewhere in the organization will give some indication of the effectiveness of the ISMS. However, this approach can often be compromised by peer-group loyalties and personal and organizational obligations. 6.6.2.2 Peer review A very similar, but alternative, option is to arrange a peer review, where the different organizational loyalties of the peer reviewers give rise to an increase in objectivity and thus assurance. This option can again be effectively at no cost if the arrangement is made reciprocally, e.g. between information security officers. However, this can of course mean that there could be an agreement for mutually positive reports. 6.6.2.3 Independent audit Independent audits can be obtained from a variety of sources, such as auditing and consultancy firms or an organization's own internal auditors, at only limited cost. The resulting report is likely to be reliable and of higher quality, reflecting a typically higher level of expertise. Such audits also bring with them a degree of “benchmarking” inasmuch as the personnel involved are likely to have performed other such independent audits from which they can draw comparisons. 6.6.2.4 Certification audit against ISO/IEC 27001 Certification audits typically encompass a scoping session, a document review and then the audit of compliance itself. Based on the experience gained by other certified organizations, healthcare organizations should engage their auditors as soon as they have decided to seek certification. The auditor then becomes more of a partner in the exercise and compliance can be achieved progressively, e.g. by initial agreement that the scope statement discussed in 6.4.1 is correctly framed and deliverable. However, it is also worth considering a peer review or independent audit at an interim stage to further limit any potential for failure. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 20 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved A common misconception is that certification is only granted when the observed information security is somehow “perfect”. The requisites are merely to have an ISMS that is already operating, a clear understanding of risks and exposures, and a management plan for reducing those exposures to an acceptable level. Indeed, during the auditing process, a limited number of faults can be identified that, subject to their materiality, will not prevent successful certification. There is also a misperception that certification is time-consuming. Yet experience has shown that certification audits of health organizations rarely require more than 5 days to 6 days effort by the certification auditor. The ultimate independent audit is that provided under the guidelines of ISO 27001, as performed by a competent, independent auditing body such as is established in many countries. This audit will be the most thorough of the options listed here, as it will be performed by a competent auditor. Such an auditor should also be competent in IT and Information Security. Both the rigour of the audit and benchmarking of practice that can be expected from such an audit are therefore high. However, experience has shown that the cost of such an audit is still of an acceptable scale. Users of this International Standard who choose to follow this route are strongly advised to engage such auditors at the start of their programme such that their support and “buy-in” are obtained progressively and so that their ultimate approval is more likely, given that there will be no “surprises” at the final audit stage. 6.7 Acting: maintaining and improving the ISMS Results of the monitoring activities described in 6.6 must return to the ISMF for further consideration as it is the ISMF that is responsible for ensuring that deficiencies are corrected and that the ISMS remains operationally effective. The SOA described in 6.4.7 can be an effective tool for keeping those responsible for clinical and corporate governance apprised of the current state of the ISMS. The format used for the SOA is also typically suitable for use as an assessment or evidence tool in support of external auditing, clinical assurance and other regulatory inspections. The security improvement plan described in 6.4.6 is also an important tool in demonstrating progress and process improvement. 7 Healthcare implications of ISO/IEC 27002 7.1 General This clause contains specific advice on the eleven security control clauses and 39 main security control categories described in ISO/IEC 27002. The general approach taken by ISO/IEC 27002 is to encourage each organization to consider and interpret that document within its own context and legal and business requirements. Yet experience gained in several countries including Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom has shown the need for certain control clauses and control categories whenever personal health information is to be secured. Based on this experience, minimum requirements are stated where appropriate and, in a few cases, normative guidelines are set out describing the proper application of certain ISO/IEC 27002 security controls to the protection of health information. These minimum requirements are so essential to the protection of personal health information that any health organizations that do not meet them cannot be said to comply with this International Standard. In every subclause that follows, the guidance given is in addition to, but not a replacement for, the guidance found in ISO/IEC 27002. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 217.2 Information security policy 7.2.1 Information security policy document Control Organizations processing health information, including personal health information, shall have a written information security policy that is approved by management, published, and then communicated to all employees and relevant external parties. Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002 on what an information security policy should contain, this policy should contain statements on: a) the need for health information security; b) the goals of health information security; c) compliance scope, as described in 6.4.1.6; d) legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements, including those for the protection of personal health information and the legal and ethical responsibilities of health professionals to protect this information; e) arrangements for notification of information security incidents, including a channel for raising concerns regarding confidentiality, without fear of blame or recrimination. Ideally, revision of the policy's contents will be driven by the findings of the organization's risk assessment, although the policy itself need only set direction, state principles and point to other documents where the (more frequently changing) specifics are to be found. In creating their information security policy document, health organizations will need to specifically consider the following factors, which are unique to the health sector: f) the breadth of health information; g) the rights and ethical responsibilities of staff, as agreed in law, and as accepted by members of professional bodies; h) the rights of subjects of care, where applicable, to privacy and to access to their records; i) the obligations of clinicians with respect to obtaining informational consent from subjects of care and maintaining the confidentiality of personal health information; j) the legitimate needs of clinicians and health organizations to be able to overcome normal security protocols when healthcare priorities, often linked to the incapacity of certain subjects of care to express their preferences, necessitate such overrides; also the procedures to be employed to achieve this; k) the obligations of the respective health organizations, and of subjects of care, where healthcare is delivered on a “shared care” or “extended care” basis; l) the protocols and procedures to be applied to the sharing of information for the purposes of research and clinical trials; m) the arrangements for, and authority limits of, temporary staff, such as locums, students and “on-call” staff; n) the arrangements for, and limitations placed upon, access to personal health information by volunteers and support staff such as clergy and charity personnel.

Where the health organization obtains support from third-party organizations or collaborates with third parties, and especially where it receives services from other jurisdictions, the policy framework should include documented policy, controls and procedures that cover such interactions and that specify the responsibilities of all parties. In cases where personal data is crossing national or jurisdictional boundaries, the provisions of ISO 22857 should be applied. 7.2.2 Review of the information security policy document Control The health organization’s information security policy should be subject to ongoing, staged review such that the totality of the policy is addressed at least annually. The policy should be reviewed after the occurrence of a serious security incident. Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, such review should address: a) the changing nature of the health organization’s operations and the concomitant changes to risk profile and risk management needs; b) the changes made to the IT infrastructure of the organization, and the concomitant changes these bring to the organization’s risk profile; c) the changes identified in the external environment that similarly impact the organization's risk profile; d) the latest controls, compliance and assurance requirements and arrangements mandated by jurisdictional health bodies or by new legislation or regulation; e) the latest guidance and recommendations from health professional associations and from information privacy commissioners regarding the protection of personal health information; f) the results of legal cases tested in the courts, which have established or negated precedents or established practices; g) the challenges and issues regarding the policy, as expressed to the organization by its staff, subjects of care and their partners and care givers, researchers and governments (e.g. privacy commissioners). 7.3 Organizing information security 7.3.1 General A health organization’s management is responsible for the security of personal health information and other protected health-related data processed by the organization. This is especially worth noting for organizations that rely upon managed services provided by third parties. Effective coordination is also an essential ingredient in maintaining information security. Both require an explicit and robust information security management infrastructure. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 237.3.2 Internal organization 7.3.2.1 Management commitment to information security, information security coordination and allocation of information security responsibilities Control Organizations processing personal health information shall: a) clearly define and assign information security responsibilities; b) have an ISMF in place to ensure that there is clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives involving the security of health information, as described in 6.4.3. At a minimum, at least one individual shall be responsible for health information security within the organization. The health information security forum shall meet regularly, on a monthly or near-to-monthly basis. (Typically, it is most effective to meet at the mid-point between the meetings of the governance body into which the forum reports. This allows emergency matters to be taken to a suitable meeting within a short period.) A formal scope statement shall be produced that defines the boundary of compliance activity in terms of people, processes, places, platforms and applications. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note the essential nature of management responsibility in organizations that are custodians of personal health information, as described in 6.2. Accountability and coordination can only be maintained over the long term if the organization has an explicit information security management infrastructure. Whatever organizational structure is adopted, it is of critical importance that it be designed and structured to facilitate access by subjects of care (e.g. to make requests to obtain personal health information), to facilitate reporting within the organizational structure and to ensure timely delivery of information. As noted in 6.4.3, the organization's (virtual or actual) information security officer should, among other duties, report to the forum and provide it with secretariat services. The officer should be responsible for collating, publishing and commenting on the reports received by forum members. Health organizations should publicise the scope statement widely within the organization, then review it and ensure it is adopted by the organization’s information, clinical and corporate governance groups. 7.3.2.2 Authorization process for information processing facilities No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.3.2.3 Confidentiality agreements Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall have a confidentiality agreement in place that specifies the confidential nature of this information. The agreement shall be applicable to all personnel accessing health information. Implementation guidance The agreement above should include reference to the penalties that are possible when a breach in the information security policy is identified. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 24 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 7.3.2.4 Contact with authorities, contact with special interest groups, and independent review of information security No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.3.3 Third parties 7.3.3.1 Identification of risks related to external parties Control Organizations processing health information shall assess the risks associated with access by external parties to these systems or the data they contain, and then implement security controls that are appropriate to the identified level of risk and to the technologies employed. Implementation guidance Risk assessment is essential for effective management of third-party access to systems containing health information, especially personal health information. The rights of subjects of care must be protected, even when an external party with potential access to personal health information is located in a jurisdiction different than the one governing the subject of care or health organization. 7.3.3.2 Addressing security when dealing with customers No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.3.3.3 Addressing security in third-party agreements Control Health organizations using the services of third parties, where the services of those parties process personal health information, shall employ formal contracts that specify: a) the confidential nature and value of the personal health information; b) the security measures to be implemented and/or complied with; c) limitations to access to these services by third parties; d) the service levels to be achieved in the services provided; e) the format and frequency of reporting to the health organization’s ISMF; f) the arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate health organization meetings and working groups; g) the arrangements for compliance auditing of the third parties; h) the penalties exacted in the event of any failure in respect of the above. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, the requirement above is intended to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health information is maintained as the information flows beyond the direct control of a health organization. Where that flow crosses jurisdictional boundaries, additional guidance can be found in ISO 22857. Where a third party is not processing personal health information, an appropriate subset of the contract features above may still be appropriate. In all cases of third-party service provision, an agreement that specifies the minimum set of controls to be applied should be adopted.

Implementation guidance Organizations processing health information should have rules for maintaining the currency of these assets (e.g. the currency of a drug database) and the integrity of these assets (e.g. the functional integrity of medical devices that record or report data). Medical devices that record or report data may require special security considerations in relation to the environment in which they operate and to the electromagnetic emissions that occur during their operation. Such devices should be uniquely identified. 7.4.2 Health information classification 7.4.2.1 Classification guidelines Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should uniformly classify such data as confidential. Implementation guidance Determining levels of protection for information assets in healthcare is complex and comparisons with government or military data classifications can be misleading. The following are important characteristics of information assets within healthcare. a) The confidentiality of personal health information is often largely subjective, rather than objective. In other words, ultimately, only the data subject (i.e. the subject of care) can make a proper determination of the relative confidentiality of various fields or groupings of data. For example, a person escaping from an abusive relationship may consider his or her new address and phone number to be much more confidential than clinical data about setting his or her broken arm. b) The confidentiality of personal health information is context-dependent. For example, the name and address of a subject of care in a list of admissions to a hospital’s emergency department may not be considered especially confidential by that individual, yet the same name and address in a list of admissions to a clinic treating sexual impotence may be considered highly confidential by the individual. c) The confidentiality of personal health information can shift over the lifetime of an individual's health record. For example, changing societal attitudes over the last 20 years have resulted in many subjects of care no longer considering their sexual orientation to be confidential. Conversely, attitudes toward drug and alcohol dependency have caused some subjects of care to consider addiction counselling data to be, if anything, even more confidential today than such data would have been considered 20 years ago.

Note that while all personal health information should be uniformly classified as confidential, practical considerations may necessitate identifying the records of subjects of care, who may be at elevated risk of access by those who do not have a need to know. Such individuals include employees of the organization itself (especially if their condition is one eliciting emotional behaviours), heads of government, celebrities, politicians, newsmakers and members of groups facing especially high risks (e.g. those with sexually transmitted diseases, or those whose personal health information contains information about genetic predisposition to serious illness). The records of such individuals may need to be specially tagged so that access can be closely monitored. However, great care must be exercised in implementing such schemes as this tagging can exacerbate the very problem it is designed to avoid, i.e. it can draw attention to the particular data items tagged. It is also important to emphasise that while certain subjects of care may be at elevated risk, their personal health information is not innately more confidential than that of other subjects of care. All personal health information is confidential and should be treated accordingly. See also the discussion in 7.5.2.1. Identifying and (where appropriate) protectively labelling information assets as confidential can be an important tool in staff training and in policy compliance. This works best when the classification acts as an indicator of required information handling practices. The classification may also be an important component of data protection agreements among jurisdictions and with third-party organizations and their staff. The identification and labelling of information assets is also an essential component of ISO/IEC 27002. In addition to the traditional classification of data on the basis of its sensitivity to disclosure, the criticality of information also needs to be classified, i.e. the extent to which the availability and integrity of the information are essential for the ongoing provision of healthcare. Time factors involved in clinical processes often play a crucial role in determining the availability requirements for personal health information. Classification in respect of availability, integrity, and criticality also needs to be applied to processes, IT devices, software, locations and personnel. Criticality should be identified through a risk assessment. 7.4.2.2 Information labelling and handling Control All health information systems processing personal health information should inform users of the confidentiality of personal health information accessible from the system (e.g. at start-up or log-in) and should label hardcopy output as confidential when it contains personal health information. Implementation guidance Not all health information is confidential and not all health information systems provide users with access to personal health information. Users of health information systems need to know when the data they are accessing contains personal health information. 7.5 Human resources security 7.5.1 Prior to employment 7.5.1.1 Roles and responsibilities Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, all organizations whose staff members are involved in processing personal health information should document such involvement in relevant job descriptions. Security roles and responsibilities, as laid down in the organization’s information security policy, should also be documented in relevant job descriptions. Special attention needs to be placed upon the roles and responsibilities of temporary or short-term staff such as locums, students, interns, etc. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 277.5.1.2 Screening Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, all organizations whose staff, contractors or volunteers process (or are expected to process) personal health information should, as a minimum, verify the identity, current address and previous employment of such staff, contractors and volunteers at the time of job applications. Implementation guidance It is important to know how and where to contact health professional staff, although, as some medical staff move on a regular basis, address details may have a limited value. Health organizations should therefore give consideration to the collection of a reasonable number of references and to undertaking other forms of check, e.g. by professional bodies and academic institutions. Wherever possible, criminal background checks should be undertaken. See also 7.8.2.1. 7.5.1.3 Terms and conditions of employment Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, all organizations that process personal health information should include in the terms and conditions of employment of employees who process, or will process, personal health information a statement about the employee’s responsibility for information security. The terms and conditions of employment should: a) include reference to the penalties that are possible when breach of the information security policy is identified; b) ensure that conditions relating to confidentiality of personal health information survive the completion of the employment in perpetuity. With respect to clinical staff, the terms and conditions of employment should specify what rights of access such staff will have to the records of subjects of care and to the associated health information systems in the event of third-party claims. If there has been a long gap between recruitment and the date of the employee starting, serious consideration should be given to repeating the screening process, or key elements of it. 7.5.2 During employment 7.5.2.1 Management responsibilities Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note the special emphasis that needs to be placed on the concerns of subjects of care who do not wish their personal health information to be accessed by health workers who are neighbours, colleagues or relatives. Such concerns often make up a large percentage of complaints from those with fears about the confidentiality of their personal health information. Likewise, staff members often do not wish to be placed unnecessarily in the position of reviewing information about friends, relatives or neighbours. Effective management of health information systems needs to address these concerns.

In addition to complying with applicable laws, such processes should comply with the agreements reached between health professionals and health professional bodies. 7.5.3 Termination or change of employment 7.5.3.1 Termination responsibilities and return of assets Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note that in healthcare, many types of staff, e.g. doctors and nurses, commonly progress through training programmes and other “rotations” where their access rights can change fundamentally. To ensure the termination of previous rights that are no longer required for their role, such changes of employment should be initially processed in the same way as for individuals who are leaving the organization’s employ. 7.5.3.2 Removal of access rights Control All organizations that process personal health information shall, as soon as possible, terminate the user access privileges with respect to such information for any departing permanent or temporary employee, third-party contractor or volunteer upon termination of employment, contracting or volunteer activities. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note the many examples in healthcare of students, interns and locums who have retained their access privileges after cessation of their internship, locum, etc. Especially in large hospitals, large numbers of temporary staff will typically have short-term access to personal health information. The termination of the access rights of such staff needs to be carefully managed. At the same time, in healthcare, many transactions take place well after the time of care (e.g. the sign-off of medical transcriptions). This can significantly complicate the process of removing access rights in a timely fashion and these transactions should be taken into account when designing and implementing procedures on the removal of access rights. Health organizations should seriously consider immediate termination of access rights following the supply of a resignation notice, notice of dismissal, etc. wherever an increased risk is perceived from the continuation of such access.

These secure areas should be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to acknowledge that in many healthcare settings, the instantiation of security perimeters is especially challenging. Many operational areas are permeated by subjects of care. Indeed, there is perhaps no other industrial sector where the public has more extensive access to operational areas than in healthcare. At the same time, a safe environment needs to be maintained that preserves the physical safety and security of subjects of care as well as of the data and systems that may be accessible within that environment. Unlike clients of other industrial sectors, clients in healthcare are often unable to physically provide for their own personal safety and security. Physical security measures for information should be coordinated with physical security and safety measures for subjects of care. Healthcare organizations have a duty to protect both. 7.6.1.2 Physical entry controls; securing offices, rooms and facilities; protecting against external and environmental threats; working in secure areas Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations that process personal health information should take sensible steps to ensure that the public are only as close to IT equipment (servers, storage devices, terminals and displays) as physical constraints and clinical processes demand. 7.6.1.3 Public access, delivery and loading areas Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note that the provision of healthcare includes distinct circumstances where the public (subjects of care and their support companions) are physically admitted into areas with vast amounts of sensitive information (e.g. laboratory testing where workflow may dictate gathering information from subjects of care in the same area where data from previous subjects is currently being processed; emergency room treatment areas where companions or relatives could potentially be exposed to significant amounts of sensitive verbal and visual information on other subjects of care; bedside computing/nursing workstations located near patient rooms). Those physical areas in healthcare that gather health information through interview and that contain systems where data are viewed on screen should therefore be subject to additional scrutiny. To ensure that the privacy of subjects of care is maintained, healthcare often requires that notices be posted in lifts, on doors behind which interviews may be conducted, and in other areas. Such notices serve as a reminder to curtail discussion of patient cases in public areas.

Medical devices that record or report data may also require special security considerations in relation to the environment in which they operate and to the electromagnetic emissions that occur during their operation. Healthcare organizations, especially hospitals, should ensure that the siting and protection guidelines for IT equipment minimize exposure to such emissions. 7.6.2.2 Supporting utilities, cabling security and equipment maintenance Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, health organizations should give serious consideration to the shielding of network and other cabling in areas with high emissions from medical devices. 7.6.2.3 Security of equipment off-premises Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall ensure that any use, outside its premises, of medical devices that record or report data has been authorized. This should include equipment used by remote workers, even where such usage is perpetual (i.e. where it forms a core feature of the employee’s role, such as for ambulance personnel, therapists, etc.) 7.6.2.4 Secure disposal or re-use of equipment Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing health information applications shall securely overwrite or else destroy all media containing health information application software or personal health information when the media are no longer required for use. 7.6.2.5 Removal of property Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations providing or using equipment, data or software to support a healthcare application containing personal health information shall not allow such equipment, data or software to be removed from the site or relocated within it without authorization by the organization. 7.7 Communications and operations management 7.7.1 Operational procedures and responsibilities 7.7.1.1 Documented operating procedures No additional guidance for information security management in health.

Implementation guidance It is important to note that inappropriate, inadequately tested or incorrect changes to the processing of personal health information can have disastrous consequences for patient care and safety. The change process should explicitly record and assess the risks of the change. 7.7.1.3 Segregation of duties Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should, where feasible, segregate duties and areas of responsibility in order to reduce opportunities for unauthorized modification or misuse of personal health information. Organizations processing personal health information should ensure that the IT systems employed contain application functionalities that enforce the approval of clinical processes by different role holders, where this is required. 7.7.1.4 Separation of development, test and operational facilities Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall separate (physically or virtually) development and testing environments for health information systems processing such information from operational environments hosting those health information systems. Rules for the migration of software from development to operational status shall be defined and documented by the organization hosting the affected application(s). 7.7.2 Third-party service delivery management Implementation guidance Third-party service delivery management is greatly simplified when a formal agreement is adopted which specifies the minimum set of controls to be implemented. 7.7.3 System planning and acceptance 7.7.3.1 Capacity management No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.3.2 System acceptance Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall establish acceptance criteria for planned new information systems, upgrades and new versions. They shall carry out suitable tests of the system prior to acceptance. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 32 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved Implementation guidance The extent and rigour of those tests should be scaled to a level consistent with the identified risks of the change. See also 7.7.1.2. 7.7.4 Protection against malicious and mobile code 7.7.4.1 Controls against malicious code Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall implement appropriate prevention, detection and response controls to protect against malicious software and shall implement appropriate user awareness training. 7.7.4.2 Controls against mobile code No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.5 Health information backup Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information shall back up all personal health information and store it in a physically secure environment to ensure its future availability. To protect its confidentiality, personal health information should be backed up in an encrypted format. 7.7.6 Network security management 7.7.6.1 Network controls No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.6.2 Security of network services Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should carefully consider what impact the loss of network service availability will have upon clinical practice. See also 7.11. 7.7.7 Media handling 7.7.7.1 Management of removable computer media Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should ensure that all personal health information stored on removable media is: a) encrypted while its media are in transit or b) protected from theft while its media are in transit. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 337.7.7.2 Disposal of media Control In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, all personal health information shall be securely overwritten or else the media destroyed when no longer required for use. Implementation guidance Improper disposal of media continues to be a source of serious breaches of patient confidentiality. It is especially important to note that this control should be applied prior to the repair or disposal of any associated equipment. This requirement also applies to medical devices that record or report data. 7.7.7.3 Information handling procedures Control In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, media containing personal health information shall be either physically protected or else have their data encrypted. The status and location of media containing unencrypted personal health information shall be monitored. 7.7.7.4 Security of system documentation No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.8 Exchanges of information 7.7.8.1 Health information exchange policies and procedures and exchange agreements Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, specific guidance on health information exchange policies can be found in ISO 22857. Though that International Standard explicitly references trans-border flow of personal health information (where borders in this context represent health jurisdictions, not necessarily national boundaries), much of its advice can be adapted, where necessary, to deal with exchange of data from one organization to another. Organizations shall ensure that the security of such exchanges of information is the subject of policy development and compliance audit (see 7.12). The security of information exchanges can be greatly assisted by the use of information exchange agreements that specify the minimum set of controls to be implemented. 7.7.8.2 Physical media in transit No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.8.3 Electronic messaging Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations transmitting personal health information by electronic messaging should take steps to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. It is important to note that security of e-mail and instant messages containing personal health information may involve procedures for health personnel that cannot be imposed upon subjects of care and the public. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 34 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved E-mail between health professionals which contains personal health information should be encrypted in transit. One approach to this involves the use of digital certificates. See the Bibliography for a list of standards related to the use of digital certificates in health environments. See also 7.12.2.2 for a discussion of consent prior to communication outside the organization. 7.7.8.4 Health information systems No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.9 Electronic health information services 7.7.9.1 Electronic commerce and online transactions Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note the care that must be taken in determining whether data involved in electronic commerce and online transactions contain personal health information. If they do, this information needs to be appropriately protected. Of special concern in healthcare are data related to billing, medical claims, invoice lines, requisitions, and other e-commerce data from which personal health information can be derived. 7.7.9.2 Publicly available health information Controls Publicly available health information (as distinct from personal health information) should be archived. The integrity of publicly available health information should be protected to prevent unauthorized modification. The source (authorship) of publicly available health information should be stated and its integrity should be protected. 7.7.10 Monitoring 7.7.10.1 General Of all security requirements protecting personal health information, among the most important are those relating to audit and logging. These ensure accountability for subjects of care entrusting their information to electronic health record systems and also provide a strong incentive to users of such systems to conform to the policies on the acceptable use of these systems. Effective audit and logging can help to uncover misuse of health information systems or of personal health information. These processes can also help organizations and subjects of care to obtain redress against users abusing their access privileges. 7.7.10.2 Audit logging Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, health information systems processing personal health information should create a secure audit record each time a user accesses, creates, updates or archives personal health information via the system. The audit log should uniquely identify the user, uniquely identify the data subject (i.e. the subject of care), identify the function performed by the user (record creation, access, update, etc.), and note the time and date at which the function was performed. When personal health information is updated, a record of the former content of the data and the associated audit record (i.e. who entered the data on what date) should be retained. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 35Messaging systems used to transmit messages containing personal health information should keep a log of message transmissions (such a log should contain the time, date, origin and destination of the message, but not its content). The organization should carefully assess and determine the retention period for these audit logs, with particular reference to clinical professional standards and legal obligations, in order to enable investigations to be carried out when necessary and to provide evidence of misuse where necessary. 7.7.10.3 Monitoring system use Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, the health information system's audit logging facility should be operational at all times while the health information system being audited is available for use. Health information systems containing personal health information should be provided with facilities for analysing logs and audit trails that: a) allow the identification of all system users who have accessed or modified a given subject of care’s record(s) over a given period of time; b) allow the identification of all subjects of care whose records have been accessed or modified by a given system user over a given period of time. 7.7.10.4 Protection of log information Control Audit records shall be secure and tamper-proof. Access to system audit tools and audit trails shall be safeguarded to prevent misuse or compromise. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note that the evidentiary integrity of audit records can play an essential role in coroners' inquests, investigations into medical malpractice, and other judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. In such proceedings, the actions of health professionals and the timing of events are sometimes determined through an examination of changes and updates to an individual's personal health information. 7.7.10.5 Administrator and operator logs No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.10.6 Fault logging No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.7.10.7 Clock synchronization Control Health information systems supporting time-critical-shared care activities shall provide time synchronization services to support tracing and reconstitution of activity timelines where required. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note that the timing of events as electronically recorded in personal health information and in audit records can play an essential role in processes such as coroners' inquests, investigations into medical malpractice, and other judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings where it is essential to accurately determine a clinical sequence of events.

In general, users of health information systems should only access personal health information: a) when a healthcare relationship exists between the user and the data subject (the subject of care whose personal health information is being accessed); b) when the user is carrying out an activity on behalf of the data subject; c) when there is a need for specific data to support this activity. 7.8.1.2 Access control policy Control Organizations processing personal health information shall have an access control policy governing access to these data. The organization’s policy on access control should be established on the basis of predefined roles with associated authorities which are consistent with, but limited to, the needs of that role. The access control policy, as a component of the information security policy framework described in 7.2.1, shall reflect professional, ethical, legal and subject-of-care-related requirements and should take account of the tasks performed by health professionals and the task’s workflow. Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to note that, in order that healthcare delivery not be delayed or baulked, there are stronger requirements than usual for a clear policy and process, with associated authorization, to override the “normal” access control rules in emergency situations. Health organizations are encouraged to consider the implementation of a federated identity and access management solution in recognition of the potential additional support, and reduced administration costs, that this will provide to the access control policy. Additionally, this will support higher-level security access processes, such as smart-card-based access and “single-sign-on” capability. 7.8.2 User access management 7.8.2.1 User registration Control Access to health information systems that process personal health information shall be subject to a formal user registration process. User registration procedures shall ensure that the level of authentication required of claimed user identity is consistent with the level(s) of access that will become available to the user. User registration details shall be periodically reviewed to ensure that they are complete, accurate and that access is still required. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 37Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, it is important to understand that the task of identifying and registering users of health information systems includes all of the following: a) the accurate capture of a user’s identity (e.g., Joan Smith, born March 26th 1982, currently resident at a specific address); b) the accurate capture, after verification, of a user’s enduring professional credentials (e.g., Dr. Joan Smith, cardiologist) and/or job title (e.g., Susan Jones, Medical Receptionist); c) the assignment of an unambiguous user identifier. Note that subjects of care are not typically system users, although those who are able to access all or part of their personal data online (e.g. via an online portal) would indeed be system users (though ones who are granted limited access). Note also that there are health applications where a user may seek general health advice and information. While this request for information may be recorded, the accessing user remains anonymous. Many Web sites offering information on pregnancy, AIDS or other public health topics operate in this fashion. Users of such general information sites do not typically require registration and are therefore excluded from consideration in the discussion that follows. See also 7.5.1.2. 7.8.2.2 Privilege management In the discussion that follows, several access control strategies are specified that can help significantly to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of personal health information. These are: a) role-based access control, which relies upon the professional credentials and job titles of users established during registration to restrict users' access privileges to just those required to fulfil one or more well-defined roles; b) workgroup-based access control, which relies upon the assignment of users to workgroups (such as clinical teams) to determine which records they can access; c) discretionary access control, which enables users of health information systems who have a legitimate relationship to a subject of care's personal health information (e.g. a family physician) to grant access to other users who have no previously established relationship to that subject of care's personal health information (e.g. a specialist). Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, health information systems containing personal health information should support role-based access control capable of mapping each user to one or more roles, and each role to one or more system functions. A user of a health information system containing personal health information shall access its services in a single role (i.e. users who have been registered with more than one role shall designate a single role during each health information system access session). Health information systems should associate users (including health professionals, supporting staff and others) with the records of subjects of care and allow future access based on this association. Additional guidance on privilege management in health can be found in ISO/TS 22600-1 and in ISO/TS 22600-2. 7.8.2.3 User password management No additional guidance for information security management in health, although it should be noted that time pressures found in health delivery situations can make effective use of passwords difficult to employ. Many health organizations have considered the adoption of alternative authentication technologies to address this problem.

Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, special consideration should be given to the technical measures by which a subject of care is securely authenticated when accessing all or part of his/her own information (in those health information systems that permit such access). Similar emphasis should also be given to the ease of use of such measures, especially for handicapped subjects of care, and to provisions for access by substitute decision makers. 7.8.5.2 Sensitive system isolation No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.8.6 Mobile computing and teleworking 7.8.6.1 Mobile computing and communications Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should: a) specifically assess the risks involved in healthcare mobile computing; b) prepare policy on the precautions to be taken when using mobile computing devices, including wireless devices; c) require their mobile users to follow this policy. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 39As noted in ISO/IEC 27002, mobile network wireless connections, while similar to those of wired networks, have some important differences from an information security point of view. Some wireless encryption protocols such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) are still in use despite known weaknesses that render them largely ineffective. Moreover, information stored on mobile devices may not always be backed up (e.g. because of limited network bandwidth or because the devices are not connected at the times when backups are scheduled). 7.8.6.2 Teleworking Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should: a) prepare policy on the precautions to be taken when teleworking; b) ensure that teleworking users of health information systems abide by this policy. Some national jurisdictions (e.g. in Germany) have already placed restrictions on teleworking by health professionals. It is important to consider that in healthcare, teleworking can cross jurisdictional borders and can even take place on board planes and ships situated beyond any national jurisdiction. Physicians already routinely e-mail medical images, etc. across boundaries to obtain specialist opinions. International teams involved in disaster relief may, in future, rely upon health information systems in jurisdictions other than their home jurisdiction. The legal and ethical considerations of doing this need to be taken into account in the design and deployment of health information systems (especially national systems) that may be used in this manner. See also 7.7.7.1 and 7.7.8.3. 7.9 Information systems acquisition, development and maintenance 7.9.1 Security requirements of information systems No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.9.2 Correct processing in applications 7.9.2.1 Uniquely identifying subjects of care Control Health information systems processing personal health information shall: a) ensure that each subject of care can be uniquely identified within the system; b) be capable of merging duplicate or multiple records if it is determined that multiple records for the same subject of care have been created unintentionally or during a medical emergency. Implementation guidance The provision of emergency care and other situations in which adequate identification of subjects of care may not have been possible will inevitably create instances of multiple records for the same patient. Some capacity must exist within every health information system to merge multiple instances of patient records into a single record. Such merging requires the greatest care and will therefore not only necessitate personnel trained in such merging, but may also require technical tools to better facilitate the integration of information from the original records into a unified whole.

Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, some additional important factors need to be considered. Before relying on personal health information provided by a health information system, health professionals need to be shown sufficient information to ensure that the subject of care they are treating matches the information retrieved. Matching a subject of care under treatment to an existing record can be a non-trivial task. Some systems enhance security by including photographic ID with each subject of care's record. Such enhancements may themselves create privacy problems, as they potentially permit the implicit capture of facial characteristics such as race that are not included as fields of data. The requirements for identification of subjects of care and the availability of data used to support it may also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Great care needs to be exercised in the design of health information systems to ensure that health professionals can trust the system to provide the information needed to confirm that each record retrieved matches the individual under treatment. Health information systems should make it possible to check that hardcopy print-outs are complete (e.g. “page 3 of 5”). 7.9.3 Cryptographic controls 7.9.3.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls and key management Implementation guidance In addition to the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, guidance on policy for the issuance and use of digital certificates in healthcare and on the management of keys can be found in ISO 17090-3. 7.9.3.2 Key management No additional guidance for information security management in health.

Information security incidents include corruption or unintentional disclosure of personal health information or the loss of availability of health information systems, where such a loss adversely affects patient care or contributes to adverse clinical events. Organizations should inform the subject of care whenever personal health information has been unintentionally disclosed. Organizations should inform the subject of care whenever lack of availability of health information systems may have adversely affected their care. There is a tendency in health organizations to artificially separate information security incidents from other types of incident, both in handling and in reporting. In recognition of the fact that a break-in could have led to theft of IT hardware (leading to a confidentiality breach), or that a fire could have been set to disguise misuse of IT equipment, or that an identified misuse or erroneous use of the system could have had clinical consequences, an information security assessment should be made either on all such incidents or on a representative incident, to further evaluate the efficacy of established controls and of the risk assessment that lead to their implementation.

Business continuity management, which includes disaster recovery, is increasingly recognised as a requirement for health organizations and the priority it is accorded continues to grow. Reflecting the rigorous availability requirements in healthcare, a major effort ought to be invested in resilience and redundancy arrangements, not just for the technology itself, and but also for the cross-training of health personnel. Business continuity planning in healthcare is especially challenging for the information security professional, as any plans will need to be suitably integrated with the organization’s plans for handling power failures, implementing infection control and dealing with other clinical emergencies. Indeed, the invocation of any of these is likely to lead directly to the invocation of the business continuity management plan, if only to provide support additional to that normally available. However, recent incidents such as the SARS outbreak have shown that major incidents may cause a staff shortage, which may then severely limit the ability to successfully operate business continuity management plans. Health organizations need to ensure that their business continuity management planning includes health crisis management planning. Health organizations also need to ensure that the plans that they develop are regularly tested on a “programmatic” basis. The tests included in that programme should build upon one another, proceeding from desktop testing to modular testing to synthesis of likely recovery times and then finally to full rehearsals. Such a programme is thus low risk and delivers real improvement in the general level of awareness in its user population. 7.12 Compliance 7.12.1 General Implementation guidance In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, health organizations should put a compliance auditing programme in place that addresses the full life cycle of operations, i.e. not just of those processes that identify issues, but also of those that review outcomes and that decide on updates to the ISMS. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved 43Health organizations’ audit programmes should be formally structured to cover all elements of this Internatioanal Standard, all areas of risk and all implemented controls, within a 12 month to 18 month cycle. In the highly regulated and audited environment of many health organizations, the ISMF ought to set itself the objective of establishing a graduated compliance auditing framework, whose bottom layer is self-audit by the process operators and managers. Thereafter, the auditing of the ISMS, on behalf of the ISMF, internal auditing, controls assurance assessments and external audits, ought to be defined in a manner that allows each layer to draw confidence from all of the layers below it. 7.12.2 Compliance with legal requirements 7.12.2.1 Identification of applicable legislation, intellectual property rights and protection of organizational records No additional guidance for information security management in health. 7.12.2.2 Data protection and privacy of personal information Control In addition to following the guidance given by ISO/IEC 27002, organizations processing personal health information should manage informational consent of subjects of care. Where possible, informational consent of subjects of care should be obtained before personal health information is e-mailed, faxed, or communicated by telephone conversation, or otherwise disclosed to parties external to the healthcare organization. Implementation guidance An example of legislation or regulation requiring informational consent from subjects of care is the Council of Europe Recommendation, R (97)5 On the Protection of Medical Data, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 12 February 1997: Before a genetic analysis is carried out, the data subject should be informed about the objectives of the analysis and the possibility of unexpected findings. They should be informed of unexpected findings if: a. not prohibited by domestic law b. the person himself has asked for this information c. the information is not likely to cause serious harm: i. to his/her health ii. to his/her consanguine or uterine kin, to a member of his/her social family, or to a person who has a direct link with his/her genetic line d. this information is of direct importance to him/her for treatment or prevention. An example of a professional ethical guideline requiring patient consent is the World Health Association's Declaration of Helsinki regarding medical research on human subjects.

As such, it constitutes a breakdown in secure user authentication. Many cases of masquerade by insiders are committed simply because it makes it easier for people to do their work. For example, when one health professional may replace another at a workstation and continues to work on an already active subject of care record, there is a strong temptation to skip the inconvenience of the first user logging out and the second user logging in. Nevertheless, masquerade by insiders is also the source of serious breaches in confidentiality. Indeed, the majority of breaches of confidentiality are committed by organizational insiders. Masquerade by insiders can also be carried out with the intention of covering up cases where harm has been caused. 2) Masquerade by service providers (including contracted maintenance personnel such as system software engineers, hardware repair personnel and others who may have a pro forma legitimate reason to access systems and data) Masquerade by service providers consists of contracted personnel using their privileged access to systems (such as during on-site testing and repair of malfunctioning equipment) to gain unauthorized access to data. As such, it is a breach of – or failure to properly provide for – secure outsourcing arrangements. Though rarer than masquerade by insiders, masquerade by service providers can also be the source of serious breaches in personal health information confidentiality. 3) Masquerade by outsiders (including hackers) Masquerade by outsiders occurs when unauthorized third parties gain access to system data or resources, either by impersonating an authorized user or by fraudulently becoming an authorized user (for example through so-called “social engineering”). In addition to hackers, masquerade by outsiders is also committed by journalists, private investigators and “hacktivists” (hackers who work on behalf of, or in sympathy with, political pressure groups). Masquerade by outsiders constitutes a failure of one or more of the following security controls: i) user identification; ii) user authentication; iii) origin authentication; iv) access control and privilege management. 4) Unauthorized use of a health information application It can be surprisingly easy to obtain unauthorized access to a health information application (for example by a subject of care walking up to an unattended workstation in a physician care office and browsing the screen). Authorized users can also perform unauthorized actions such as maliciously altering data. In the UK, Dr. Harold Shipman attempted to hide the notorious murder of scores of his patients by altering records on his computer system. Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 46 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved The critical importance of correctly identifying subjects of care and correctly matching them to their health records leads health organizations to collect detailed identifying information on patients treated. This identifying information is of great potential value to those who would use it to commit identity theft and so must be rigorously protected. In general, unauthorized use of health information applications constitutes a failure of one or more of the following: i) workgroup access control (e.g., by allowing a user to access the records of subjects of care with whom the user has no legitimate relationship); ii) accountability and audit control (e.g., by allowing inappropriate user actions to go unnoticed); iii) personnel security (e.g., by providing inadequate training to users or not making clear that their access to records is subject to audit and review). 5) Introduction of damaging or disruptive software (including viruses, worms and other “malware”) Most IT security incidents involve computer viruses. Introduction of damaging or disruptive software constitutes a failure in anti-virus protection or in software change control. While typically within the remit of network sysops, the proliferation of e-mail worms and viruses as well as exploitation by hackers of weaknesses in server software have combined to greatly complicate measures taken to prevent the introduction of damaging or disruptive software. 6) Misuse of system resources This threat includes users using health information systems and services for personal work, users downloading non-work-related information from the Internet on to computers intended solely to support health information systems, users setting up databases or other applications for non-work-related matters, or users degrading the availability of health information systems by, for example, using network bandwidth to download streaming video or audio for personal use. Such misuse constitutes a failure to enforce acceptable use agreements or to educate users about the importance of maintaining the integrity and availability of health information resources. 7) Communications infiltration Communications infiltration of electronic communications occurs when an individual (a hacker, for example) tampers with the normal flow of data across a network. The most common result is a denial-of-service attack (in which servers or network resources are effectively taken off-line), but other forms of communication infiltration are possible (such as a replay attack, in which a valid but out-of-date message is retransmitted in a way that makes it appear current). Communications infiltration constitutes a failure of intrusion detection and/or network access controls and/or risk analysis (specifically vulnerability analysis) and/or system architecture (which needs to be designed with defence against denial-of-service attacks). 8) Communications interception If not encrypted during transmission, the confidentiality of information contained in a message can be abrogated by intercepting the communication. This is simpler than it sounds, as anyone on local area network can potentially install a so-called “packet sniffer” on their workstation and monitor much of the network traffic on their local area network, including reading e-mails during transmission. Hacker tools are readily available to automate and simplify much of this process. Communications interception constitutes a failure in secure communications.

Establishing unambiguously whether personal health information flowed from one health provider to another can be an essential feature of investigations into medical malpractice. Repudiation can constitute a failure to apply controls such as digital signatures on e-prescriptions (an example of repudiation of origin) or controls such as read receipts on e-mail messages (an example of repudiation of receipt). 10) Connection failure (including failures of health information networks) All networks are subject to periodic service outages. Quality of service is a major factor in the provisioning of network services in healthcare. Connection failure can also result from misdirection of network services (for example malicious alteration of routing tables that cause network traffic to be diverted). Connection failures can facilitate the disclosure of confidential information by forcing users to send messages by a less secure mechanism, such as via fax or over the Internet. 11) Embedding of malicious code This threat includes e-mail viruses and hostile mobile code. While in no way unique to health information systems, the increasing use of wireless and mobile technologies by healthcare providers increases this threat's potential for damage. Embedding of malicious code constitutes a failure to apply anti-virus software controls or intrusion prevention controls effectively. 12) Accidental misrouting This threat includes the possibility that information might be delivered to an incorrect address when it is being sent over a network. Accidental misrouting could constitute a failure in user education or a failure to maintain the integrity of directories of health providers (or both). 13) Technical failure of the host, storage facility or network infrastructure These threats include hardware failures, network failures or failures in data storage facilities. Such failures typically constitute a failure of one or more of the operations management controls listed in Clause 10 of ISO/IEC 27002:2005. While in no way unique to health information systems, the loss of availability of such systems can have life-threatening consequences for patients. 14) Environmental support failure (including power failures and disruptions of service arising from natural or man-made disasters) Health information systems can be critical during natural disasters and other events that can be life-threatening to large numbers of people. These same disasters can wreak havoc on the environmental support systems needed to maintain operations. A proper threat and risk assessment of health information will include an assessment of how critical such systems are in times of natural disaster and how robust their operations will be under such disaster scenarios. 15) System or network software failure Denial-of-service attacks are greatly facilitated by weaknesses in, or misconfiguration of, operating system or network operating system software. System or network software failure constitutes a failure in software integrity checking, system testing or software maintenance controls. 16) Application software failure (e.g., of a health information application) Failures in application software can be exploited in a denial-of-service attack and can also be used to compromise the confidentiality of protected data. Application software failure constitutes a failure in software testing, software change controls, or software integrity checking.

Operator error constitutes a failure in one or more of the following: i) operations controls; ii) personnel security (including effective training); iii) disaster recovery (including data backup and restoration). 18) Maintenance error Maintenance errors are mistakes by those responsible for maintaining systems hardware and software. Maintenance errors can be committed by staff members as well as by third-party employees contracted to perform maintenance duties. Such errors can, in turn, endanger the confidentiality of protected data. Misconfiguration of software during installation is a common cause of vulnerabilities later exploited by hackers. Maintenance errors constitute a failure in hardware maintenance controls, software maintenance controls, software change controls or some combination of the above. 19) User error Error by users can, for example, result in confidential information being sent to the wrong recipient. User errors can sometimes constitute a failure in: i) user controls (including user interfaces designed with security in mind) or ii) personnel security (including training). 20) Staff shortage The threat of staff shortage includes the possibility of the absence of key personnel and the difficulty of replacing them. Vulnerability to this threat depends on the extent to which shortage of staff would affect the business processes. In healthcare, an epidemic that greatly increases the demand for timely access to health information may also create a staff shortage that jeopardises the availability of such systems. A failure of this kind constitutes a failure in business continuity management (see Clause 14 of ISO/IEC 27002:2005). 21) Theft by insiders (including theft of equipment or data) Insiders typically have greater access to confidential information than outsiders and are therefore in a favourable position to steal the information in order to sell it or to disclose it to others. While comparatively rare, the threat of theft of personal health information by insiders increases with the fame or notoriety of the data subject (e.g., a celebrity or head of state) and decreases with the potential severity of punitive consequences (e.g., the loss by a physician of their license to practice). Theft by insiders constitutes a failure of one of many possible controls, including controls on hardcopy output, documents or media, physical security, or physical protection of equipment. 22) Theft by outsiders (including theft of equipment or data) Theft by outsiders of data and equipment is a serious problem in some hospitals. Theft may result in breaches of confidentiality, either because confidential data reside on a server or laptop computer that is stolen or else because the data themselves are the target of the theft. Theft by outsiders may constitute a failure in one of many controls, including mobile computing controls, secure media transport, incident handling, compliance checks or physical theft protection.

The users of health information systems are typically dedicated health professionals and wilful damage is rare. Wilful damage by insiders constitutes a failure of human resources security (see Clause 8 of ISO/IEC 27002:2005). 24) Wilful damage by outsiders The threat of wilful damage by outsiders includes acts of vandalism and other cases where physical damage is caused to IT systems or their supporting environment by people who have not been granted access to such systems. While in most industrial sectors, acts of this kind constitute a failure to effectively apply physical security controls, access by subjects of care and their friends and relatives to operational areas of hospitals, clinics and other health organizations make such threats much more difficult to prevent than in most other operational environments. The security controls in Clause 9 of ISO/IEC 27002:2005 need to be carefully selected and applied to minimize such threats. 25) Terrorism The threat of terrorism includes acts by extremist groups wishing to damage or disrupt the work of health organizations or to harm healthcare providers or to disrupt the operations of health information systems. While no such large-scale attacks have occurred yet, planners need to consider the threat of terrorism, especially when large-scale health information systems are designed, since an attack on such systems could increase the effectiveness of bioterrorist and other attacks that cause a health-related crisis.

attributes of support tools C.1 Potential benefits of support tools Although database tools are by no means mandatory, evidence has repeatedly shown that they provide significant benefits. There are a wide range of tools available, at a range of costs – from the simple and cheap to the extensive and more expensive. Health organizations, when considering the adoption of tools, should seek out evidence of successful use by others, and should consider carefully the associated training and maintenance costs, although these are unlikely to be major. National health organizations will presumably want to maximize compliance while minimizing costs. Clearly, it is unnecessary for hundreds of hospitals to do essentially the same risk assessments. To address this problem, the UK National Health Service, for example, developed a toolkit in which generic risk models of typical health environments had been captured. Local use of the tool thereafter focuses upon creating a customized solution consistent with the local situation while still maintaining compliance with a centrally defined model. A similar approach could also be taken to the ISO/IEC 27002 process steps. The potential benefits of tool support are: a) simplified data entry and data maintenance; b) pre-formatted reports and other outputs; c) simplified version control; d) optimized data re-use within the process; e) consistency of approach; f) re-usability of data and results in subsequent exercises; g) comparability of results; h) completeness of approach; i) confidence of third parties, especially auditors; j) visibility of the implications of decisions; k) decision support and other management processes; l) capacity to undertake searches and interrogations; m) significantly reduced human resource costs; n) relatively easy transfer of material to successors.

C.3 Tool support for ISO/IEC 27002 process Tool support to the ISO/IEC 27002 process should cover: a) scoping and scope statement production; b) gap analysis and gap analysis reporting; c) asset definition and asset inventory reporting; d) secure improvement plan production, reporting and implementation status recording; e) statement of applicability recording and reporting; f) security resource definition and reporting. It is worth noting that all the above processes interact and need to be able to interoperate. C.4 Tool support for risk analysis process The risk analysis and management functionality that can be supported by tools encompass all the minimum processes defined in Clause C.3. However, the more advanced tools additionally provide one or more of the following: a) risk model library support; b) asset libraries; c) asset valuation tools; d) dependency modelling support; e) asset grouping for assessment efficiency; f) threat/asset/impact mappings for high integrity within the assessments; Licensed Copy: Mr. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia User, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 23/08/2008 04:52, UncontrolledCopy, (c) BSIBS EN ISO 27799:2008ISO 27799:2008(E) 56 © ISO 2008 – All rights reserved g) multiple levels of threat and vulnerability assessment to meet different needs; h) countermeasure libraries; i) prioritization functionality; j) costing and time scaling of improvements; k) security documentation support; l) decision support functions; m) auditing support; n) risk treatment reporting; o) “What If?” functionality; p) graphical reports.

Cybersecurity-related attacks have become not only more numerous and diverse but also more damaging and disruptive. New types of security-related incidents emerge frequently. Preventive activities based on the results of risk assessments can lower the number of incidents, but not all incidents can be prevented. An incident response capability is therefore necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring IT services. To that end, this publication provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications. Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. Continually monitoring for attacks is essential. Establishing clear procedures for prioritizing the handling of incidents is critical, as is implementing effective methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data. It is also vital to build relationships and establish suitable means of communication with other internal groups (e.g., human resources, legal) and with external groups (e.g., other incident response teams, law enforcement). This publication assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently and effectively. This revision of the publication, Revision 2, updates material throughout the publication to reflect the changes in attacks and incidents. Understanding threats and identifying modern attacks in their early stages is key to preventing subsequent compromises, and proactively sharing information among organizations regarding the signs of these attacks is an increasingly effective way to identify them. Implementing the following requirements and recommendations should facilitate efficient and effective incident response for Federal departments and agencies. Organizations must create, provision, and operate a formal incident response capability. Federal law requires Federal agencies to report incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires Federal agencies to establish incident response capabilities. Each Federal civilian agency must designate a primary and secondary point of contact (POC) with US-CERT and report all incidents consistent with the agency’s incident response policy. Each agency is responsible for determining how to fulfill these requirements.  Establishing an incident response capability should include the following actions:  Creating an incident response policy and plan  Developing procedures for performing incident handling and reporting  Setting guidelines for communicating with outside parties regarding incidents  Selecting a team structure and staffing model  Establishing relationships and lines of communication between the incident response team and other groups, both internal (e.g., legal department) and external (e.g., law enforcement agencies)  Determining what services the incident response team should provide COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 2  Staffing and training the incident response team. Organizations should reduce the frequency of incidents by effectively securing networks, systems, and applications. Preventing problems is often less costly and more effective than reacting to them after they occur. Thus, incident prevention is an important complement to an incident response capability. If security controls are insufficient, high volumes of incidents may occur. This could overwhelm the resources and capacity for response, which would result in delayed or incomplete recovery and possibly more extensive damage and longer periods of service and data unavailability. Incident handling can be performed more effectively if organizations complement their incident response capability with adequate resources to actively maintain the security of networks, systems, and applications. This includes training IT staff on complying with the organization’s security standards and making users aware of policies and procedures regarding appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications. Organizations should document their guidelines for interactions with other organizations regarding incidents. During incident handling, the organization will need to communicate with outside parties, such as other incident response teams, law enforcement, the media, vendors, and victim organizations. Because these communications often need to occur quickly, organizations should predetermine communication guidelines so that only the appropriate information is shared with the right parties.  Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors. Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling every incident. This publication defines several types of incidents, based on common attack vectors; these categories are not intended to provide definitive classification for incidents, but rather to be used as a basis for defining more specific handling procedures. Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. The attack vectors are:  External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media (e.g., flash drive, CD) or a peripheral device.  Attrition: An attack that employs brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services.  Web: An attack executed from a website or web-based application.  Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment.  Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage policies by an authorized user, excluding the above categories.  Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the organization, such as a laptop or smartphone.  Other: An attack that does not fit into any of the other categories. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 3 Organizations should emphasize the importance of incident detection and analysis throughout the organization. In an organization, millions of possible signs of incidents may occur each day, recorded mainly by logging and computer security software. Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data and select events of interest for human review. Event correlation software can be of great value in automating the analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the quality of the data that goes into it. Organizations should establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate information is collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly. Organizations should create written guidelines for prioritizing incidents. Prioritizing the handling of individual incidents is a critical decision point in the incident response process. Effective information sharing can help an organization identify situations that are of greater severity and demand immediate attention. Incidents should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, such as the functional impact of the incident (e.g., current and likely future negative impact to business functions), the information impact of the incident (e.g., effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s information), and the recoverability from the incident (e.g., the time and types of resources that must be spent on recovering from the incident). Organizations should use the lessons learned process to gain value from incidents. After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a lessons learned meeting to review the effectiveness of the incident handling process and identify necessary improvements to existing security controls and practices. Lessons learned meetings can also be held periodically for lesser incidents as time and resources permit. The information accumulated from all lessons learned meetings should be used to identify and correct systemic weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures. Follow-up reports generated for each resolved incident can be important not only for evidentiary purposes but also for reference in handling future incidents and in training new team members.   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 4 1. Introduction 1.1 Authority The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III. This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired. Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official. 1.2 Purpose and Scope This publication seeks to assist organizations in mitigating the risks from computer security incidents by providing practical guidelines on responding to incidents effectively and efficiently. It includes guidelines on establishing an effective incident response program, but the primary focus of the document is detecting, analyzing, prioritizing, and handling incidents. Organizations are encouraged to tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security and mission requirements. 1.3 Audience This document has been created for computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), system and network administrators, security staff, technical support staff, chief information security officers (CISOs), chief information officers (CIOs), computer security program managers, and others who are responsible for preparing for, or responding to, security incidents. 1.4 Document Structure The remainder of this document is organized into the following sections and appendices:  Section 2 discusses the need for incident response, outlines possible incident response team structures, and highlights other groups within an organization that may participate in incident handling.  Section 3 reviews the basic incident handling steps and provides advice for performing incident handling more effectively, particularly incident detection and analysis.  Section 4 examines the need for incident response coordination and information sharing. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 5  Appendix A contains incident response scenarios and questions for use in incident response tabletop discussions.   Appendix B provides lists of suggested data fields to collect for each incident.   Appendices C and D contain a glossary and acronym list, respectively.   Appendix E identifies resources that may be useful in planning and performing incident response.   Appendix F covers frequently asked questions about incident response.   Appendix G lists the major steps to follow when handling a computer security incident-related crisis.  Appendix H contains a change log listing significant changes since the previous revision. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 6 2. Organizing a Computer Security Incident Response Capability Organizing an effective computer security incident response capability (CSIRC) involves several major decisions and actions. One of the first considerations should be to create an organization-specific definition of the term “incident” so that the scope of the term is clear. The organization should decide what services the incident response team should provide, consider which team structures and models can provide those services, and select and implement one or more incident response teams. Incident response plan, policy, and procedure creation is an important part of establishing a team, so that incident response is performed effectively, efficiently, and consistently, and so that the team is empowered to do what needs to be done. The plan, policies, and procedures should reflect the team’s interactions with other teams within the organization as well as with outside parties, such as law enforcement, the media, and other incident response organizations. This section provides not only guidelines that should be helpful to organizations that are establishing incident response capabilities, but also advice on maintaining and enhancing existing capabilities. 2.1 Events and Incidents An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Events include a user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a web page, a user sending email, and a firewall blocking a connection attempt. Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution of malware that destroys data. This guide addresses only adverse events that are computer security-related, not those caused by natural disasters, power failures, etc. A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation1 of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Examples of incidents2 are:  An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to a web server, causing it to crash.  Users are tricked into opening a “quarterly report” sent via email that is actually malware; running the tool has infected their computers and established connections with an external host.  An attacker obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details will be released publicly if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money.  A user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services. 2.2 Need for Incident Response Attacks frequently compromise personal and business data, and it is critical to respond quickly and effectively when security breaches occur. The concept of computer security incident response has become widely accepted and implemented. One of the benefits of having an incident response capability is that it supports responding to incidents systematically (i.e., following a consistent incident handling methodology) so that the appropriate actions are taken. Incident response helps personnel to minimize loss or theft of information and disruption of services caused by incidents. Another benefit of incident response is the ability to use information gained during incident handling to better prepare for handling                                                       1  An “imminent threat of violation” refers to a situation in which the organization has a factual basis for believing that a specific incident is about to occur. For example, the antivirus software maintainers may receive a bulletin from the software vendor, warning them of new malware that is rapidly spreading across the Internet. 2  For the remainder of this document, the terms “incident” and “computer security incident” are interchangeable. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 7 future incidents and to provide stronger protection for systems and data. An incident response capability also helps with dealing properly with legal issues that may arise during incidents.  Besides the business reasons to establish an incident response capability, Federal departments and agencies must comply with law, regulations, and policy directing a coordinated, effective defense against information security threats. Chief among these are the following:  OMB’s Circular No. A-130, Appendix III,3 released in 2000, which directs Federal agencies to “ensure that there is a capability to provide help to users when a security incident occurs in the system and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats. This capability shall share information with other organizations … and should assist the agency in pursuing appropriate legal action, consistent with Department of Justice guidance.”   FISMA (from 2002),4 which requires agencies to have “procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents” and establishes a centralized Federal information security incident center, in part to: – “Provide timely technical assistance to operators of agency information systems … including guidance on detecting and handling information security incidents … – Compile and analyze information about incidents that threaten information security … – Inform operators of agency information systems about current and potential information security threats, and vulnerabilities … .”  Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems5, March 2006, which specifies minimum security requirements for Federal information and information systems, including incident response. The specific requirements are defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.  OMB Memorandum M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information6, May 2007, which provides guidance on reporting security incidents that involve PII.  2.3 Incident Response Policy, Plan, and Procedure Creation This section discusses policies, plans, and procedures related to incident response, with an emphasis on interactions with outside parties. 2.3.1 Policy Elements Policy governing incident response is highly individualized to the organization. However, most policies include the same key elements:  Statement of management commitment  Purpose and objectives of the policy                                                       3  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html 4  http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf  5  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html  6  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf    COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 8  Scope of the policy (to whom and what it applies and under what circumstances)  Definition of computer security incidents and related terms  Organizational structure and definition of roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority; should include the authority of the incident response team to confiscate or disconnect equipment and to monitor suspicious activity, the requirements for reporting certain types of incidents, the requirements and guidelines for external communications and information sharing (e.g., what can be shared with whom, when, and over what channels), and the handoff and escalation points in the incident management process  Prioritization or severity ratings of incidents   Performance measures (as discussed in Section 3.4.2)  Reporting and contact forms. 2.3.2 Plan Elements Organizations should have a formal, focused, and coordinated approach to responding to incidents, including an incident response plan that provides the roadmap for implementing the incident response capability. Each organization needs a plan that meets its unique requirements, which relates to the organization’s mission, size, structure, and functions. The plan should lay out the necessary resources and management support. The incident response plan should include the following elements:  Mission  Strategies and goals  Senior management approval  Organizational approach to incident response  How the incident response team will communicate with the rest of the organization and with other organizations  Metrics for measuring the incident response capability and its effectiveness  Roadmap for maturing the incident response capability  How the program fits into the overall organization. The organization’s mission, strategies, and goals for incident response should help in determining the structure of its incident response capability. The incident response program structure should also be discussed within the plan. Section 2.4.1 discusses the types of structures. Once an organization develops a plan and gains management approval, the organization should implement the plan and review it at least annually to ensure the organization is following the roadmap for maturing the capability and fulfilling their goals for incident response. 2.3.3 Procedure Elements Procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms used by the incident response team. SOPs should be reasonably comprehensive and detailed to ensure that the COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 9 priorities of the organization are reflected in response operations. In addition, following standardized responses should minimize errors, particularly those that might be caused by stressful incident handling situations. SOPs should be tested to validate their accuracy and usefulness, then distributed to all team members. Training should be provided for SOP users; the SOP documents can be used as an instructional tool. Suggested SOP elements are presented throughout Section 3. 2.3.4 Sharing Information With Outside Parties Organizations often need to communicate with outside parties regarding an incident, and they should do so whenever appropriate, such as contacting law enforcement, fielding media inquiries, and seeking external expertise. Another example is discussing incidents with other involved parties, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), the vendor of vulnerable software, or other incident response teams. Organizations may also proactively share relevant incident indicator information with peers to improve detection and analysis of incidents. The incident response team should discuss information sharing with the organization’s public affairs office, legal department, and management before an incident occurs to establish policies and procedures regarding information sharing. Otherwise, sensitive information regarding incidents may be provided to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to additional disruption and financial loss. The team should document all contacts and communications with outside parties for liability and evidentiary purposes. The following sections provide guidelines on communicating with several types of outside parties, as depicted in Figure 2-1. The double-headed arrows indicate that either party may initiate communications. See Section 4 for additional information on communicating with outside parties, and see Section 2.4 for a discussion of communications involving incident response outsourcers. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 10  Figure 2-1. Communications with Outside Parties 2.3.4.1 The Media The incident handling team should establish media communications procedures that comply with the organization’s policies on media interaction and information disclosure.7 For discussing incidents with the media, organizations often find it beneficial to designate a single point of contact (POC) and at least one backup contact. The following actions are recommended for preparing these designated contacts and should also be considered for preparing others who may be communicating with the media:  Conduct training sessions on interacting with the media regarding incidents, which should include the importance of not revealing sensitive information, such as technical details of countermeasures that could assist other attackers, and the positive aspects of communicating important information to the public fully and effectively.  Establish procedures to brief media contacts on the issues and sensitivities regarding a particular incident before discussing it with the media.                                                        7  For example, an organization may want members of its public affairs office and legal department to participate in all incident discussions with the media. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 11  Maintain a statement of the current status of the incident so that communications with the media are consistent and up-to-date.  Remind all staff of the general procedures for handling media inquiries.  Hold mock interviews and press conferences during incident handling exercises. The following are examples of questions to ask the media contact: – Who attacked you? Why? – When did it happen? How did it happen? Did this happen because you have poor security practices? – How widespread is this incident? What steps are you taking to determine what happened and to prevent future occurrences? – What is the impact of this incident? Was any personally identifiable information (PII) exposed? What is the estimated cost of this incident? 2.3.4.2 Law Enforcement One reason that many security-related incidents do not result in convictions is that some organizations do not properly contact law enforcement. Several levels of law enforcement are available to investigate incidents: for example, within the United States, Federal investigatory agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and the U.S. Secret Service), district attorney offices, state law enforcement, and local (e.g., county) law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies in other countries may also be involved, such as for attacks launched from or directed at locations outside the US. In addition, agencies have an Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigation of violation of the law within each agency. The incident response team should become acquainted with its various law enforcement representatives before an incident occurs to discuss conditions under which incidents should be reported to them, how the reporting should be performed, what evidence should be collected, and how it should be collected. Law enforcement should be contacted through designated individuals in a manner consistent with the requirements of the law and the organization’s procedures. Many organizations prefer to appoint one incident response team member as the primary POC with law enforcement. This person should be familiar with the reporting procedures for all relevant law enforcement agencies and well prepared to recommend which agency, if any, should be contacted. Note that the organization typically should not contact multiple agencies because doing so might result in jurisdictional conflicts. The incident response team should understand what the potential jurisdictional issues are (e.g., physical location—an organization based in one state has a server located in a second state attacked from a system in a third state, being used remotely by an attacker in a fourth state). 2.3.4.3 Incident Reporting Organizations FISMA requires Federal agencies to report incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT),8 which is a governmentwide incident response organization that assists Federal civilian agencies in their incident handling efforts. US-CERT does not replace existing agency response teams; rather, it augments the efforts of Federal civilian agencies by serving as a focal point for dealing with incidents. US-CERT analyzes the agency-provided information to identify trends and indicators of attacks; these are easier to discern when reviewing data from many organizations than when reviewing the data of a single organization.                                                       8   http://www.us-cert.gov/  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 12 Each agency must designate a primary and secondary POC with US-CERT and report all incidents consistent with the agency’s incident response policy. Organizations should create a policy that states who is designated to report incidents and how the incidents should be reported. Requirements, categories, and timeframes for reporting incidents to US-CERT are on the US-CERT website.9 All Federal agencies must ensure that their incident response procedures adhere to US-CERT’s reporting requirements and that the procedures are followed properly.  All organizations are encouraged to report incidents to their appropriate CSIRTs. If an organization does not have its own CSIRT to contact, it can report incidents to other organizations, including Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). One of the functions of these industry-specific private sector groups is to share important computer security-related information among their members. Several ISACs have been formed for industry sectors such as Communications, Electric Sector, Financial Services, Information Technology, and Research and Education.10 2.3.4.4 Other Outside Parties An organization may want to discuss incidents with other groups, including those listed below. When reaching out to these external parties, an organization may want to work through US-CERT or its ISAC, as a “trusted introducer” to broker the relationship. It is likely that others are experiencing similar issues, and the trusted introducer can ensure that any such patterns are identified and taken into consideration.   Organization’s ISP. An organization may need assistance from its ISP in blocking a major network-based attack or tracing its origin.  Owners of Attacking Addresses. If attacks are originating from an external organization’s IP address space, incident handlers may want to talk to the designated security contacts for the organization to alert them to the activity or to ask them to collect evidence. It is highly recommended to coordinate such communications with US-CERT or an ISAC.  Software Vendors. Incident handlers may want to speak to a software vendor about suspicious activity. This contact could include questions regarding the significance of certain log entries or known false positives for certain intrusion detection signatures, where minimal information regarding the incident may need to be revealed. More information may need to be provided in some cases—for example, if a server appears to have been compromised through an unknown software vulnerability. Software vendors may also provide information on known threats (e.g., new attacks) to help organizations understand the current threat environment.   Other Incident Response Teams. An organization may experience an incident that is similar to ones handled by other teams; proactively sharing information can facilitate more effective and efficient incident handling (e.g., providing advance warning, increasing preparedness, developing situational awareness). Groups such as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)11, the Government Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (GFIRST)12, and the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)13 are not incident response teams, but they promote information sharing among incident response teams.   Affected External Parties. An incident may affect external parties directly—for example, an outside organization may contact the organization and claim that one of the organization’s users is attacking                                                       9  http://www.us-cert.gov/federal/reportingRequirements.html  10  See the National Council of ISACs website at http://www.isaccouncil.org/ for a list of ISACs.  11  http://www.first.org/  12  GFIRST is specifically for Federal departments and agencies. (http://www.us-cert.gov/federal/gfirst.html) 13  http://www.antiphishing.org/  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 13 it. Another way in which external parties may be affected is if an attacker gains access to sensitive information regarding them, such as credit card information. In some jurisdictions, organizations are required to notify all parties that are affected by such an incident. Regardless of the circumstances, it is preferable for the organization to notify affected external parties of an incident before the media or other external organizations do so. Handlers should be careful to give out only appropriate information—the affected parties may request details about internal investigations that should not be revealed publicly.  OMB Memorandum M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, requires Federal agencies to develop and implement a breach notification policy for personally identifiable information (PII).14 Incident handlers should understand how their incident handling actions should differ when a PII breach is suspected to have occurred, such as notifying additional parties or notifying parties within a shorter timeframe. Specific recommendations for PII breach notification policies are presented in OMB Memorandum M-07-16. Also, the National Conference of State Legislatures has a list of state security breach notification laws.15  2.4 Incident Response Team Structure An incident response team should be available for anyone who discovers or suspects that an incident involving the organization has occurred. One or more team members, depending on the magnitude of the incident and availability of personnel, will then handle the incident. The incident handlers analyze the incident data, determine the impact of the incident, and act appropriately to limit the damage and restore normal services. The incident response team’s success depends on the participation and cooperation of individuals throughout the organization. This section identifies such individuals, discusses incident response team models, and provides advice on selecting an appropriate model. 2.4.1 Team Models Possible structures for an incident response team include the following:   Central Incident Response Team. A single incident response team handles incidents throughout the organization. This model is effective for small organizations and for organizations with minimal geographic diversity in terms of computing resources.  Distributed Incident Response Teams. The organization has multiple incident response teams, each responsible for a particular logical or physical segment of the organization. This model is effective for large organizations (e.g., one team per division) and for organizations with major computing resources at distant locations (e.g., one team per geographic region, one team per major facility). However, the teams should be part of a single coordinated entity so that the incident response process is consistent across the organization and information is shared among teams. This is particularly important because multiple teams may see components of the same incident or may handle similar incidents.   Coordinating Team. An incident response team provides advice to other teams without having authority over those teams—for example, a departmentwide team may assist individual agencies’ teams. This model can be thought of as a CSIRT for CSIRTs. Because the focus of this document is                                                       14  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf 15  http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13489  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 14 central and distributed CSIRTs, the coordinating team model is not addressed in detail in this document.16 Incident response teams can also use any of three staffing models:   Employees. The organization performs all of its incident response work, with limited technical and administrative support from contractors.  Partially Outsourced. The organization outsources portions of its incident response work. Section 2.4.2 discusses the major factors that should be considered with outsourcing. Although incident response duties can be divided among the organization and one or more outsourcers in many ways, a few arrangements have become commonplace: – The most prevalent arrangement is for the organization to outsource 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week (24/7) monitoring of intrusion detection sensors, firewalls, and other security devices to an offsite managed security services provider (MSSP). The MSSP identifies and analyzes suspicious activity and reports each detected incident to the organization’s incident response team. – Some organizations perform basic incident response work in-house and call on contractors to assist with handling incidents, particularly those that are more serious or widespread.  Fully Outsourced. The organization completely outsources its incident response work, typically to an onsite contractor. This model is most likely to be used when the organization needs a full-time, onsite incident response team but does not have enough available, qualified employees. It is assumed that the organization will have employees supervising and overseeing the outsourcer’s work. 2.4.2 Team Model Selection When selecting appropriate structure and staffing models for an incident response team, organizations should consider the following factors:  The Need for 24/7 Availability. Most organizations need incident response staff to be available 24/7. This typically means that incident handlers can be contacted by phone, but it can also mean that an onsite presence is required. Real-time availability is the best for incident response because the longer an incident lasts, the more potential there is for damage and loss. Real-time contact is often needed when working with other organizations—for example, tracing an attack back to its source.  Full-Time Versus Part-Time Team Members. Organizations with limited funding, staffing, or incident response needs may have only part-time incident response team members, serving as more of a virtual incident response team. In this case, the incident response team can be thought of as a volunteer fire department. When an emergency occurs, the team members are contacted rapidly, and those who can assist do so. An existing group such as the IT help desk can act as a first POC for incident reporting. The help desk members can be trained to perform the initial investigation and data gathering and then alert the incident response team if it appears that a serious incident has occurred.  Employee Morale. Incident response work is very stressful, as are the on-call responsibilities of most team members. This combination makes it easy for incident response team members to become overly stressed. Many organizations will also struggle to find willing, available, experienced, and properly skilled people to participate, particularly in 24-hour support. Segregating roles, particularly                                                       16  Information about the Coordinating team model, as well as extensive information on other team models, is available in a CERT®/CC document titled Organizational Models for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) (http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/03hb001.pdf). COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 15 reducing the amount of administrative work that team members are responsible for performing, can be a significant boost to morale.  Cost. Cost is a major factor, especially if employees are required to be onsite 24/7. Organizations may fail to include incident response-specific costs in budgets, such as sufficient funding for training and maintaining skills. Because the incident response team works with so many facets of IT, its members need much broader knowledge than most IT staff members. They must also understand how to use the tools of incident response, such as digital forensics software. Other costs that may be overlooked are physical security for the team’s work areas and communications mechanisms.  Staff Expertise. Incident handling requires specialized knowledge and experience in several technical areas; the breadth and depth of knowledge required varies based on the severity of the organization’s risks. Outsourcers may possess deeper knowledge of intrusion detection, forensics, vulnerabilities, exploits, and other aspects of security than employees of the organization. Also, MSSPs may be able to correlate events among customers so that they can identify new threats more quickly than any individual customer could. However, technical staff members within the organization usually have much better knowledge of the organization’s environment than an outsourcer would, which can be beneficial in identifying false positives associated with organization-specific behavior and the criticality of targets. Section 2.4.3 contains additional information on recommended team member skills. When considering outsourcing, organizations should keep these issues in mind:  Current and Future Quality of Work. Organizations should consider not only the current quality (breadth and depth) of the outsourcer’s work, but also efforts to ensure the quality of future work—for example, minimizing turnover and burnout and providing a solid training program for new employees. Organizations should think about how they could objectively assess the quality of the outsourcer’s work.  Division of Responsibilities. Organizations are often unwilling to give an outsourcer authority to make operational decisions for the environment (e.g., disconnecting a web server). It is important to document the appropriate actions for these decision points. For example, one partially outsourced model addresses this issue by having the outsourcer provide incident data to the organization’s internal team, along with recommendations for further handling the incident. The internal team ultimately makes the operational decisions, with the outsourcer continuing to provide support as needed.  Sensitive Information Revealed to the Contractor. Dividing incident response responsibilities and restricting access to sensitive information can limit this. For example, a contractor may determine what user ID was used in an incident (e.g., ID 123456) but not know what person is associated with the user ID. Employees can then take over the investigation. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are one possible option for protecting the disclosure of sensitive information.  Lack of Organization-Specific Knowledge. Accurate analysis and prioritization of incidents are dependent on specific knowledge of the organization’s environment. The organization should provide the outsourcer regularly updated documents that define what incidents it is concerned about, which resources are critical, and what the level of response should be under various sets of circumstances. The organization should also report all changes and updates made to its IT infrastructure, network configuration, and systems. Otherwise, the contractor has to make a best guess as to how each incident should be handled, inevitably leading to mishandled incidents and frustration on both sides. Lack of organization-specific knowledge can also be a problem when incident response is not outsourced if communications are weak among teams or if the organization simply does not collect the necessary information. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 16  Lack of Correlation. Correlation among multiple data sources is very important. If the intrusion detection system records an attempted attack against a web server, but the outsourcer has no access to the server’s logs, it may be unable to determine whether the attack was successful. To be efficient, the outsourcer will require administrative privileges to critical systems and security device logs remotely over a secure channel. This will increase administration costs, introduce additional access entry points, and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.  Handling Incidents at Multiple Locations. Effective incident response work often requires a physical presence at the organization’s facilities. If the outsourcer is offsite, consider where the outsourcer is located, how quickly it can have an incident response team at any facility, and how much this will cost. Consider onsite visits; perhaps there are certain facilities or areas where the outsourcer should not be permitted to work.  Maintaining Incident Response Skills In-House. Organizations that completely outsource incident response should strive to maintain basic incident response skills in-house. Situations may arise in which the outsourcer is unavailable, so the organization should be prepared to perform its own incident handling. The organization’s technical staff must also be able to understand the significance, technical implications, and impact of the outsourcer’s recommendations. 2.4.3 Incident Response Personnel A single employee, with one or more designated alternates, should be in charge of incident response. In a fully outsourced model, this person oversees and evaluates the outsourcer’s work. All other models generally have a team manager and one or more deputies who assumes authority in the absence of the team manager. The managers typically perform a variety of tasks, including acting as a liaison with upper management and other teams and organizations, defusing crisis situations, and ensuring that the team has the necessary personnel, resources, and skills. Managers should be technically adept and have excellent communication skills, particularly an ability to communicate to a range of audiences. Managers are ultimately responsible for ensuring that incident response activities are performed properly. In addition to the team manager and deputy, some teams also have a technical lead—a person with strong technical skills and incident response experience who assumes oversight of and final responsibility for the quality of the team’s technical work. The position of technical lead should not be confused with the position of incident lead. Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a specific incident; the incident lead is held accountable for the incident’s handling. Depending on the size of the incident response team and the magnitude of the incident, the incident lead may not actually perform any actual incident handling, but rather coordinate the handlers’ activities, gather information from the handlers, provide incident updates to other groups, and ensure that the team’s needs are met. Members of the incident response team should have excellent technical skills, such as system administration, network administration, programming, technical support, or intrusion detection. Every team member should have good problem solving skills and critical thinking abilities. It is not necessary for every team member to be a technical expert—to a large degree, practical and funding considerations will dictate this—but having at least one highly proficient person in each major area of technology (e.g., commonly attacked operating systems and applications) is a necessity. It may also be helpful to have some team members specialize in particular technical areas, such as network intrusion detection, malware analysis, or forensics. It is also often helpful to temporarily bring in technical specialists that aren’t normally part of the team. It is important to counteract staff burnout by providing opportunities for learning and growth. Suggestions for building and maintaining skills are as follows: COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 17  Budget enough funding to maintain, enhance, and expand proficiency in technical areas and security disciplines, as well as less technical topics such as the legal aspects of incident response. This should include sending staff to conferences and encouraging or otherwise incentivizing participation in conferences, ensuring the availability of technical references that promote deeper technical understanding, and occasionally bringing in outside experts (e.g., contractors) with deep technical knowledge in needed areas as funding permits.  Give team members opportunities to perform other tasks, such as creating educational materials, conducting security awareness workshops, and performing research.  Consider rotating staff members in and out of the incident response team, and participate in exchanges in which team members temporarily trade places with others (e.g., network administrators) to gain new technical skills.  Maintain sufficient staffing so that team members can have uninterrupted time off work (e.g., vacations).  Create a mentoring program to enable senior technical staff to help less experienced staff learn incident handling.  Develop incident handling scenarios and have the team members discuss how they would handle them. Appendix A contains a set of scenarios and a list of questions to be used during scenario discussions. Incident response team members should have other skills in addition to technical expertise. Teamwork skills are of fundamental importance because cooperation and coordination are necessary for successful incident response. Every team member should also have good communication skills. Speaking skills are important because the team will interact with a wide variety of people, and writing skills are important when team members are preparing advisories and procedures. Although not everyone within a team needs to have strong writing and speaking skills, at least a few people within every team should possess them so the team can represent itself well in front of others. 2.4.4 Dependencies within Organizations It is important to identify other groups within the organization that may need to participate in incident handling so that their cooperation can be solicited before it is needed. Every incident response team relies on the expertise, judgment, and abilities of others, including:  Management. Management establishes incident response policy, budget, and staffing. Ultimately, management is held responsible for coordinating incident response among various stakeholders, minimizing damage, and reporting to Congress, OMB, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and other parties.  Information Assurance. Information security staff members may be needed during certain stages of incident handling (prevention, containment, eradication, and recovery)—for example, to alter network security controls (e.g., firewall rulesets).  IT Support. IT technical experts (e.g., system and network administrators) not only have the needed skills to assist but also usually have the best understanding of the technology they manage on a daily basis. This understanding can ensure that the appropriate actions are taken for the affected system, such as whether to disconnect an attacked system. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 18  Legal Department. Legal experts should review incident response plans, policies, and procedures to ensure their compliance with law and Federal guidance, including the right to privacy. In addition, the guidance of the general counsel or legal department should be sought if there is reason to believe that an incident may have legal ramifications, including evidence collection, prosecution of a suspect, or a lawsuit, or if there may be a need for a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other binding agreements involving liability limitations for information sharing.  Public Affairs and Media Relations. Depending on the nature and impact of an incident, a need may exist to inform the media and, by extension, the public.   Human Resources. If an employee is suspected of causing an incident, the human resources department may be involved—for example, in assisting with disciplinary proceedings.  Business Continuity Planning. Organizations should ensure that incident response policies and procedures and business continuity processes are in sync. Computer security incidents undermine the business resilience of an organization. Business continuity planning professionals should be made aware of incidents and their impacts so they can fine-tune business impact assessments, risk assessments, and continuity of operations plans. Further, because business continuity planners have extensive expertise in minimizing operational disruption during severe circumstances, they may be valuable in planning responses to certain situations, such as denial of service (DoS) conditions.   Physical Security and Facilities Management. Some computer security incidents occur through breaches of physical security or involve coordinated logical and physical attacks. The incident response team also may need access to facilities during incident handling—for example, to acquire a compromised workstation from a locked office.  2.5 Incident Response Team Services The main focus of an incident response team is performing incident response, but it is fairly rare for a team to perform incident response only. The following are examples of other services a team might offer:  Intrusion Detection. The first tier of an incident response team often assumes responsibility for intrusion detection.17 The team generally benefits because it should be poised to analyze incidents more quickly and accurately, based on the knowledge it gains of intrusion detection technologies.  Advisory Distribution. A team may issue advisories within the organization regarding new vulnerabilities and threats.18 Automated methods should be used whenever appropriate to disseminate information; for example, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides information via XML and RSS feeds when new vulnerabilities are added to it.19 Advisories are often most necessary when new threats are emerging, such as a high-profile social or political event (e.g., celebrity wedding) that attackers are likely to leverage in their social engineering. Only one group within the organization should distribute computer security advisories to avoid duplicated effort and conflicting information.  Education and Awareness. Education and awareness are resource multipliers—the more the users and technical staff know about detecting, reporting, and responding to incidents, the less drain there                                                       17  See NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) for more information on IDPS technologies. It is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-94.  18  Teams should word advisories so that they do not blame any person or organization for security issues. Teams should meet with legal advisors to discuss the possible need for a disclaimer in advisories, stating that the team and organization has no liability in regard to the accuracy of the advisory. This is most pertinent when advisories may be sent to contractors, vendors, and other nonemployees who are users of the organization’s computing resources. 19  http://nvd.nist.gov/  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 19 should be on the incident response team. This information can be communicated through many means: workshops, websites, newsletters, posters, and even stickers on monitors and laptops.  Information Sharing. Incident response teams often participate in information sharing groups, such as ISACs or regional partnerships. Accordingly, incident response teams often manage the organization’s incident information sharing efforts, such as aggregating information related to incidents and effectively sharing that information with other organizations, as well as ensuring that pertinent information is shared within the enterprise. 2.6 Recommendations The key recommendations presented in this section for organizing a computer security incident handling capability are summarized below.  Establish a formal incident response capability. Organizations should be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when computer security defenses are breached. FISMA requires Federal agencies to establish incident response capabilities.  Create an incident response policy. The incident response policy is the foundation of the incident response program. It defines which events are considered incidents, establishes the organizational structure for incident response, defines roles and responsibilities, and lists the requirements for reporting incidents, among other items.  Develop an incident response plan based on the incident response policy. The incident response plan provides a roadmap for implementing an incident response program based on the organization’s policy. The plan indicates both short- and long-term goals for the program, including metrics for measuring the program. The incident response plan should also indicate how often incident handlers should be trained and the requirements for incident handlers.  Develop incident response procedures. The incident response procedures provide detailed steps for responding to an incident. The procedures should cover all the phases of the incident response process. The procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan.  Establish policies and procedures regarding incident-related information sharing. The organization should communicate appropriate incident details with outside parties, such as the media, law enforcement agencies, and incident reporting organizations. The incident response team should discuss this with the organization’s public affairs office, legal department, and management to establish policies and procedures regarding information sharing. The team should comply with existing organization policy on interacting with the media and other outside parties.  Provide pertinent information on incidents to the appropriate organization. Federal civilian agencies are required to report incidents to US-CERT; other organizations can contact US-CERT and/or their ISAC. Reporting is beneficial because US-CERT and the ISACs use the reported data to provide information to the reporting parties regarding new threats and incident trends.  Consider the relevant factors when selecting an incident response team model. Organizations should carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each possible team structure model and staffing model in the context of the organization’s needs and available resources.  Select people with appropriate skills for the incident response team. The credibility and proficiency of the team depend to a large extent on the technical skills and critical thinking abilities of its members. Critical technical skills include system administration, network administration, programming, technical support, and intrusion detection. Teamwork and communications skills are COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 20 also needed for effective incident handling. Necessary training should be provided to all team members.  Identify other groups within the organization that may need to participate in incident handling. Every incident response team relies on the expertise, judgment, and abilities of other teams, including management, information assurance, IT support, legal, public affairs, and facilities management.  Determine which services the team should offer. Although the main focus of the team is incident response, most teams perform additional functions. Examples include monitoring intrusion detection sensors, distributing security advisories, and educating users on security. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 21 3. Handling an Incident The incident response process has several phases. The initial phase involves establishing and training an incident response team, and acquiring the necessary tools and resources. During preparation, the organization also attempts to limit the number of incidents that will occur by selecting and implementing a set of controls based on the results of risk assessments. However, residual risk will inevitably persist after controls are implemented. Detection of security breaches is thus necessary to alert the organization whenever incidents occur. In keeping with the severity of the incident, the organization can mitigate the impact of the incident by containing it and ultimately recovering from it. During this phase, activity often cycles back to detection and analysis—for example, to see if additional hosts are infected by malware while eradicating a malware incident. After the incident is adequately handled, the organization issues a report that details the cause and cost of the incident and the steps the organization should take to prevent future incidents. This section describes the major phases of the incident response process—preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity—in detail. Figure 3-1 illustrates the incident response life cycle.  Figure 3-1. Incident Response Life Cycle 3.1 Preparation Incident response methodologies typically emphasize preparation—not only establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the incident response team is not typically responsible for incident prevention, it is fundamental to the success of incident response programs. This section provides basic advice on preparing to handle incidents and on preventing incidents. 3.1.1 Preparing to Handle Incidents The lists below provide examples of tools and resources available that may be of value during incident handling. These lists are intended to be a starting point for discussions about which tools and resources an organization’s incident handlers need. For example, smartphones are one way to have resilient emergency COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 22 communication and coordination mechanisms. An organization should have multiple (separate and different) communication and coordination mechanisms in case of failure of one mechanism. Incident Handler Communications and Facilities:  Contact information for team members and others within and outside the organization (primary and backup contacts), such as law enforcement and other incident response teams; information may include phone numbers, email addresses, public encryption keys (in accordance with the encryption software described below), and instructions for verifying the contact’s identity  On-call information for other teams within the organization, including escalation information  Incident reporting mechanisms, such as phone numbers, email addresses, online forms, and secure instant messaging systems that users can use to report suspected incidents; at least one mechanism should permit people to report incidents anonymously  Issue tracking system for tracking incident information, status, etc.  Smartphones to be carried by team members for off-hour support and onsite communications  Encryption software to be used for communications among team members, within the organization and with external parties; for Federal agencies, software must use a FIPS-validated encryption algorithm20  War room for central communication and coordination; if a permanent war room is not necessary or practical, the team should create a procedure for procuring a temporary war room when needed  Secure storage facility for securing evidence and other sensitive materials Incident Analysis Hardware and Software:  Digital forensic workstations21 and/or backup devices to create disk images, preserve log files, and save other relevant incident data  Laptops for activities such as analyzing data, sniffing packets, and writing reports  Spare workstations, servers, and networking equipment, or the virtualized equivalents, which may be used for many purposes, such as restoring backups and trying out malware  Blank removable media  Portable printer to print copies of log files and other evidence from non-networked systems  Packet sniffers and protocol analyzers to capture and analyze network traffic  Digital forensic software to analyze disk images  Removable media with trusted versions of programs to be used to gather evidence from systems  Evidence gathering accessories, including hard-bound notebooks, digital cameras, audio recorders, chain of custody forms, evidence storage bags and tags, and evidence tape, to preserve evidence for possible legal actions                                                       20  FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html. 21  A digital forensic workstation is specially designed to assist incident handlers in acquiring and analyzing data. These workstations typically contain a set of removable hard drives that can be used for evidence storage. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 23 Incident Analysis Resources:  Port lists, including commonly used ports and Trojan horse ports  Documentation for OSs, applications, protocols, and intrusion detection and antivirus products  Network diagrams and lists of critical assets, such as database servers  Current baselines of expected network, system, and application activity  Cryptographic hashes of critical files22 to speed incident analysis, verification, and eradication Incident Mitigation Software:  Access to images of clean OS and application installations for restoration and recovery purposes Many incident response teams create a jump kit, which is a portable case that contains materials that may be needed during an investigation. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Other important materials include backup devices, blank media, and basic networking equipment and cables. Because the purpose of having a jump kit is to facilitate faster responses, the team should avoid borrowing items from the jump kit.  Each incident handler should have access to at least two computing devices (e.g., laptops). One, such as the one from the jump kit, should be used to perform packet sniffing, malware analysis, and all other actions that risk contaminating the laptop that performs them. This laptop should be scrubbed and all software reinstalled before it is used for another incident. Note that because this laptop is special purpose, it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-purpose investigative laptops. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis. Exercises involving simulated incidents can also be very useful for preparing staff for incident handling; see NIST SP 800-84 for more information on exercises23 and Appendix A for sample exercise scenarios. 3.1.2 Preventing Incidents Keeping the number of incidents reasonably low is very important to protect the business processes of the organization. If security controls are insufficient, higher volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming the incident response team. This can lead to slow and incomplete responses, which translate to a larger negative business impact (e.g., more extensive damage, longer periods of service and data unavailability).  It is outside the scope of this document to provide specific advice on securing networks, systems, and applications. Although incident response teams are generally not responsible for securing resources, they can be advocates of sound security practices. An incident response team may be able to identify problems that the organization is otherwise not aware of; the team can play a key role in risk assessment and training by identifying gaps. Other documents already provide advice on general security concepts and                                                       22  The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) Project maintains records of hashes of various files, including operating system, application, and graphic image files. The hashes can be downloaded from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/. 23  Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-84  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 24 operating system and application-specific guidelines.24 The following text, however, provides a brief overview of some of the main recommended practices for securing networks, systems, and applications:  Risk Assessments. Periodic risk assessments of systems and applications should determine what risks are posed by combinations of threats and vulnerabilities.25 This should include understanding the applicable threats, including organization-specific threats. Each risk should be prioritized, and the risks can be mitigated, transferred, or accepted until a reasonable overall level of risk is reached. Another benefit of conducting risk assessments regularly is that critical resources are identified, allowing staff to emphasize monitoring and response activities for those resources.26  Host Security. All hosts should be hardened appropriately using standard configurations. In addition to keeping each host properly patched, hosts should be configured to follow the principle of least privilege—granting users only the privileges necessary for performing their authorized tasks. Hosts should have auditing enabled and should log significant security-related events. The security of hosts and their configurations should be continuously monitored.27 Many organizations use Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)28 expressed operating system and application configuration checklists to assist in securing hosts consistently and effectively.29  Network Security. The network perimeter should be configured to deny all activity that is not expressly permitted. This includes securing all connection points, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and dedicated connections to other organizations.  Malware Prevention. Software to detect and stop malware should be deployed throughout the organization. Malware protection should be deployed at the host level (e.g., server and workstation operating systems), the application server level (e.g., email server, web proxies), and the application client level (e.g., email clients, instant messaging clients).30   User Awareness and Training. Users should be made aware of policies and procedures regarding appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications. Applicable lessons learned from previous incidents should also be shared with users so they can see how their actions could affect the organization. Improving user awareness regarding incidents should reduce the frequency of incidents. IT staff should be trained so that they can maintain their networks, systems, and applications in accordance with the organization’s security standards.                                                        24  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html provides links to the NIST Special Publications on computer security, which include documents on operating system and application security baselines. 25  Guidelines on risk assessment are available in NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-30-Rev1.  26  Information on identifying critical resources is discussed in FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.  27  For more information on continuous monitoring, see NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-137).  28  More information on SCAP is available from NIST SP 800-117 Revision 1, Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-117). 29  NIST hosts a security checklists repository at http://checklists.nist.gov/.  30  More information on malware prevention is available from NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-83). COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 25 3.2 Detection and Analysis  Figure 3-2. Incident Response Life Cycle (Detection and Analysis) 3.2.1 Attack Vectors Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling every incident. Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors. Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. The attack vectors listed below are not intended to provide definitive classification for incidents; rather, they simply list common methods of attack, which can be used as a basis for defining more specific handling procedures.   External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media or a peripheral device—for example, malicious code spreading onto a system from an infected USB flash drive.  Attrition: An attack that employs brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services (e.g., a DDoS intended to impair or deny access to a service or application; a brute force attack against an authentication mechanism, such as passwords, CAPTCHAS, or digital signatures).  Web: An attack executed from a website or web-based application—for example, a cross-site scripting attack used to steal credentials or a redirect to a site that exploits a browser vulnerability and installs malware.  Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment—for example, exploit code disguised as an attached document or a link to a malicious website in the body of an email message.  Impersonation: An attack involving replacement of something benign with something malicious—for example, spoofing, man in the middle attacks, rogue wireless access points, and SQL injection attacks all involve impersonation.  Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage policies by an authorized user, excluding the above categories; for example, a user installs file sharing software, leading to the loss of sensitive data; or a user performs illegal activities on a system. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 26  Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the organization, such as a laptop, smartphone, or authentication token.  Other: An attack that does not fit into any of the other categories. This section focuses on recommended practices for handling any type of incident. It is outside the scope of this publication to give specific advice based on the attack vectors; such guidelines would be provided in separate publications addressing other incident handling topics, such as NIST SP 800-83 on malware incident prevention and handling. 3.2.2 Signs of an Incident For many organizations, the most challenging part of the incident response process is accurately detecting and assessing possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, and magnitude of the problem. What makes this so challenging is a combination of three factors:  Incidents may be detected through many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity. Automated detection capabilities include network-based and host-based IDPSs, antivirus software, and log analyzers. Incidents may also be detected through manual means, such as problems reported by users. Some incidents have overt signs that can be easily detected, whereas others are almost impossible to detect.  The volume of potential signs of incidents is typically high—for example, it is not uncommon for an organization to receive thousands or even millions of intrusion detection sensor alerts per day. (See Section 3.2.4 for information on analyzing such alerts.)  Deep, specialized technical knowledge and extensive experience are necessary for proper and efficient analysis of incident-related data.  Signs of an incident fall into one of two categories: precursors and indicators. A precursor is a sign that an incident may occur in the future. An indicator is a sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring now.  Most attacks do not have any identifiable or detectable precursors from the target’s perspective. If precursors are detected, the organization may have an opportunity to prevent the incident by altering its security posture to save a target from attack. At a minimum, the organization could monitor activity involving the target more closely. Examples of precursors are:  Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner  An announcement of a new exploit that targets a vulnerability of the organization’s mail server  A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization. While precursors are relatively rare, indicators are all too common. Too many types of indicators exist to exhaustively list them, but some examples are listed below:  A network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a buffer overflow attempt occurs against a database server.  Antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with malware.  A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters.  A host records an auditing configuration change in its log. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 27  An application logs multiple failed login attempts from an unfamiliar remote system.  An email administrator sees a large number of bounced emails with suspicious content.  A network administrator notices an unusual deviation from typical network traffic flows. 3.2.3 Sources of Precursors and Indicators Precursors and indicators are identified using many different sources, with the most common being computer security software alerts, logs, publicly available information, and people. Table 3-2 lists common sources of precursors and indicators for each category. Table 3-1. Common Sources of Precursors and Indicators Source Description Alerts IDPSs IDPS products identify suspicious events and record pertinent data regarding them, including the date and time the attack was detected, the type of attack, the source and destination IP addresses, and the username (if applicable and known). Most IDPS products use attack signatures to identify malicious activity; the signatures must be kept up to date so that the newest attacks can be detected. IDPS software often produces false positives—alerts that indicate malicious activity is occurring, when in fact there has been none. Analysts should manually validate IDPS alerts either by closely reviewing the recorded supporting data or by getting related data from other sources.31 SIEMs Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products are similar to IDPS products, but they generate alerts based on analysis of log data (see below). Antivirus and antispam software Antivirus software detects various forms of malware, generates alerts, and prevents the malware from infecting hosts. Current antivirus products are effective at stopping many instances of malware if their signatures are kept up to date. Antispam software is used to detect spam and prevent it from reaching users’ mailboxes. Spam may contain malware, phishing attacks, and other malicious content, so alerts from antispam software may indicate attack attempts. File integrity checking software File integrity checking software can detect changes made to important files during incidents. It uses a hashing algorithm to obtain a cryptographic checksum for each designated file. If the file is altered and the checksum is recalculated, an extremely high probability exists that the new checksum will not match the old checksum. By regularly recalculating checksums and comparing them with previous values, changes to files can be detected. Third-party monitoring services Third parties offer a variety of subscription-based and free monitoring services. An example is fraud detection services that will notify an organization if its IP addresses, domain names, etc. are associated with current incident activity involving other organizations. There are also free real-time blacklists with similar information. Another example of a third-party monitoring service is a CSIRC notification list; these lists are often available only to other incident response teams. Logs Operating system, service and application logs Logs from operating systems, services, and applications (particularly audit-related data) are frequently of great value when an incident occurs, such as recording which accounts were accessed and what actions were performed. Organizations should require a baseline level of logging on all systems and a higher baseline level on critical systems. Logs can be used for analysis by correlating event information. Depending on the event information, an alert can be generated to indicate an incident. Section 3.2.4 discusses the value of centralized logging. Network device logs Logs from network devices such as firewalls and routers are not typically a primary source of precursors or indicators. Although these devices are usually configured to log blocked connection attempts, they provide little information about the nature of the activity. Still, they can be valuable in identifying network trends and in correlating events detected by other devices.                                                       31  See NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, for additional information on IDPS products. It is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-94.  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 28 Source Description Network flows A network flow is a particular communication session occurring between hosts. Routers and other networking devices can provide network flow information, which can be used to find anomalous network activity caused by malware, data exfiltration, and other malicious acts. There are many standards for flow data formats, including NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX. Publicly Available Information Information on new vulnerabilities and exploits Keeping up with new vulnerabilities and exploits can prevent some incidents from occurring and assist in detecting and analyzing new attacks. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) contains information on vulnerabilities.32 Organizations such as US-CERT33 and CERT®/CC periodically provide threat update information through briefings, web postings, and mailing lists. People People from within the organization Users, system administrators, network administrators, security staff, and others from within the organization may report signs of incidents. It is important to validate all such reports. One approach is to ask people who provide such information how confident they are of the accuracy of the information. Recording this estimate along with the information provided can help considerably during incident analysis, particularly when conflicting data is discovered. People from other organizations Reports of incidents that originate externally should be taken seriously. For example, the organization might be contacted by a party claiming a system at the organization is attacking its systems. External users may also report other indicators, such as a defaced web page or an unavailable service. Other incident response teams also may report incidents. It is important to have mechanisms in place for external parties to report indicators and for trained staff to monitor those mechanisms carefully; this may be as simple as setting up a phone number and email address, configured to forward messages to the help desk.  3.2.4 Incident Analysis Incident detection and analysis would be easy if every precursor or indicator were guaranteed to be accurate; unfortunately, this is not the case. For example, user-provided indicators such as a complaint of a server being unavailable are often incorrect. Intrusion detection systems may produce false positives—incorrect indicators. These examples demonstrate what makes incident detection and analysis so difficult: each indicator ideally should be evaluated to determine if it is legitimate. Making matters worse, the total number of indicators may be thousands or millions a day. Finding the real security incidents that occurred out of all the indicators can be a daunting task. Even if an indicator is accurate, it does not necessarily mean that an incident has occurred. Some indicators, such as a server crash or modification of critical files, could happen for several reasons other than a security incident, including human error. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. Determining whether a particular event is actually an incident is sometimes a matter of judgment. It may be necessary to collaborate with other technical and information security personnel to make a decision. In many instances, a situation should be handled the same way regardless of whether it is security related. For example, if an organization is losing Internet connectivity every 12 hours and no one knows the cause, the staff would want to resolve the problem just as quickly and would use the same resources to diagnose the problem, regardless of its cause. Some incidents are easy to detect, such as an obviously defaced web page. However, many incidents are not associated with such clear symptoms. Small signs such as one change in one system configuration file may be the only indicators that an incident has occurred. In incident handling, detection may be the most difficult task. Incident handlers are responsible for analyzing ambiguous, contradictory, and incomplete symptoms to determine what has happened. Although technical solutions exist that can make detection                                                       32  http://nvd.nist.gov/  33  http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/signup.html  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 29 easier, the best remedy is to build a team of highly experienced and proficient staff members who can analyze the precursors and indicators effectively and efficiently and take appropriate actions. Without a well-trained and capable staff, incident detection and analysis will be conducted inefficiently, and costly mistakes will be made. The incident response team should work quickly to analyze and validate each incident, following a pre-defined process and documenting each step taken. When the team believes that an incident has occurred, the team should rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, such as which networks, systems, or applications are affected; who or what originated the incident; and how the incident is occurring (e.g., what tools or attack methods are being used, what vulnerabilities are being exploited). The initial analysis should provide enough information for the team to prioritize subsequent activities, such as containment of the incident and deeper analysis of the effects of the incident. Performing the initial analysis and validation is challenging. The following are recommendations for making incident analysis easier and more effective:  Profile Networks and Systems. Profiling is measuring the characteristics of expected activity so that changes to it can be more easily identified. Examples of profiling are running file integrity checking software on hosts to derive checksums for critical files and monitoring network bandwidth usage to determine what the average and peak usage levels are on various days and times. In practice, it is difficult to detect incidents accurately using most profiling techniques; organizations should use profiling as one of several detection and analysis techniques.  Understand Normal Behaviors. Incident response team members should study networks, systems, and applications to understand what their normal behavior is so that abnormal behavior can be recognized more easily. No incident handler will have a comprehensive knowledge of all behavior throughout the environment, but handlers should know which experts could fill in the gaps. One way to gain this knowledge is through reviewing log entries and security alerts. This may be tedious if filtering is not used to condense the logs to a reasonable size. As handlers become more familiar with the logs and alerts, they should be able to focus on unexplained entries, which are usually more important to investigate. Conducting frequent log reviews should keep the knowledge fresh, and the analyst should be able to notice trends and changes over time. The reviews also give the analyst an indication of the reliability of each source.  Create a Log Retention Policy. Information regarding an incident may be recorded in several places, such as firewall, IDPS, and application logs. Creating and implementing a log retention policy that specifies how long log data should be maintained may be extremely helpful in analysis because older log entries may show reconnaissance activity or previous instances of similar attacks. Another reason for retaining logs is that incidents may not be discovered until days, weeks, or even months later. The length of time to maintain log data is dependent on several factors, including the organization’s data retention policies and the volume of data. See NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management for additional recommendations related to logging.34  Perform Event Correlation. Evidence of an incident may be captured in several logs that each contain different types of data—a firewall log may have the source IP address that was used, whereas an application log may contain a username. A network IDPS may detect that an attack was launched against a particular host, but it may not know if the attack was successful. The analyst may need to examine the host’s logs to determine that information. Correlating events among multiple indicator sources can be invaluable in validating whether a particular incident occurred.                                                        34  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-92  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 30  Keep All Host Clocks Synchronized. Protocols such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronize clocks among hosts.35 Event correlation will be more complicated if the devices reporting events have inconsistent clock settings. From an evidentiary standpoint, it is preferable to have consistent timestamps in logs—for example, to have three logs that show an attack occurred at 12:07:01 a.m., rather than logs that list the attack as occurring at 12:07:01, 12:10:35, and 11:07:06.  Maintain and Use a Knowledge Base of Information. The knowledge base should include information that handlers need for referencing quickly during incident analysis. Although it is possible to build a knowledge base with a complex structure, a simple approach can be effective. Text documents, spreadsheets, and relatively simple databases provide effective, flexible, and searchable mechanisms for sharing data among team members. The knowledge base should also contain a variety of information, including explanations of the significance and validity of precursors and indicators, such as IDPS alerts, operating system log entries, and application error codes.  Use Internet Search Engines for Research. Internet search engines can help analysts find information on unusual activity. For example, an analyst may see some unusual connection attempts targeting TCP port 22912. Performing a search on the terms “TCP,” “port,” and “22912” may return some hits that contain logs of similar activity or even an explanation of the significance of the port number. Note that separate workstations should be used for research to minimize the risk to the organization from conducting these searches.   Run Packet Sniffers to Collect Additional Data. Sometimes the indicators do not record enough detail to permit the handler to understand what is occurring. If an incident is occurring over a network, the fastest way to collect the necessary data may be to have a packet sniffer capture network traffic. Configuring the sniffer to record traffic that matches specified criteria should keep the volume of data manageable and minimize the inadvertent capture of other information. Because of privacy concerns, some organizations may require incident handlers to request and receive permission before using packet sniffers.   Filter the Data. There is simply not enough time to review and analyze all the indicators; at minimum the most suspicious activity should be investigated. One effective strategy is to filter out categories of indicators that tend to be insignificant. Another filtering strategy is to show only the categories of indicators that are of the highest significance; however, this approach carries substantial risk because new malicious activity may not fall into one of the chosen indicator categories.  Seek Assistance from Others. Occasionally, the team will be unable to determine the full cause and nature of an incident. If the team lacks sufficient information to contain and eradicate the incident, then it should consult with internal resources (e.g., information security staff) and external resources (e.g., US-CERT, other CSIRTs, contractors with incident response expertise). It is important to accurately determine the cause of each incident so that it can be fully contained and the exploited vulnerabilities can be mitigated to prevent similar incidents from occurring. 3.2.5 Incident Documentation An incident response team that suspects that an incident has occurred should immediately start recording all facts regarding the incident.36 A logbook is an effective and simple medium for this,37 but laptops,                                                       35  More information on NTP is available at http://www.ntp.org/. 36  Incident handlers should log only the facts regarding the incident, not personal opinions or conclusions. Subjective material should be presented in incident reports, not recorded as evidence. 37  If a logbook is used, it is preferable that the logbook is bound and that the incident handlers number the pages, write in ink, and leave the logbook intact (i.e., do not rip out any pages). COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 31 audio recorders, and digital cameras can also serve this purpose.38 Documenting system events, conversations, and observed changes in files can lead to a more efficient, more systematic, and less error-prone handling of the problem. Every step taken from the time the incident was detected to its final resolution should be documented and timestamped. Every document regarding the incident should be dated and signed by the incident handler. Information of this nature can also be used as evidence in a court of law if legal prosecution is pursued. Whenever possible, handlers should work in teams of at least two: one person can record and log events while the other person performs the technical tasks. Section 3.3.2 presents more information about evidence.39 The incident response team should maintain records about the status of incidents, along with other pertinent information.40 Using an application or a database, such as an issue tracking system, helps ensure that incidents are handled and resolved in a timely manner. The issue tracking system should contain information on the following:  The current status of the incident (new, in progress, forwarded for investigation, resolved, etc.)  A summary of the incident  Indicators related to the incident  Other incidents related to this incident  Actions taken by all incident handlers on this incident  Chain of custody, if applicable  Impact assessments related to the incident  Contact information for other involved parties (e.g., system owners, system administrators)  A list of evidence gathered during the incident investigation  Comments from incident handlers  Next steps to be taken (e.g., rebuild the host, upgrade an application).41 The incident response team should safeguard incident data and restrict access to it because it often contains sensitive information—for example, data on exploited vulnerabilities, recent security breaches, and users that may have performed inappropriate actions. For example, only authorized personnel should have access to the incident database. Incident communications (e.g., emails) and documents should be encrypted or otherwise protected so that only authorized personnel can read them.                                                       38  Consider the admissibility of evidence collected with a device before using it. For example, any devices that are potential sources of evidence should not themselves be used to record other evidence. 39  NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques Into Incident Response, provides detailed information on establishing a forensic capability, including the development of policies and procedures.  40  Appendix B contains a suggested list of data elements to collect when incidents are reported. Also, the CERT®/CC document State of the Practice of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) provides several sample incident reporting forms. The document is available at http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/03tr001.pdf. 41  The Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association (TERENA) has developed RFC 3067, TERENA's Incident Object Description and Exchange Format Requirements (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3067.txt). The document provides recommendations for what information should be collected for each incident. The IETF Extended Incident Handling (inch) Working Group (http://www.cert.org/ietf/inch/inch.html) created an RFC that expands on TERENA’s work—RFC 5070, Incident Object Description Exchange Format (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt).  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 32 3.2.6 Incident Prioritization Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling process. Incidents should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis as a result of resource limitations. Instead, handling should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, such as the following:  Functional Impact of the Incident. Incidents targeting IT systems typically impact the business functionality that those systems provide, resulting in some type of negative impact to the users of those systems. Incident handlers should consider how the incident will impact the existing functionality of the affected systems. Incident handlers should consider not only the current functional impact of the incident, but also the likely future functional impact of the incident if it is not immediately contained.  Information Impact of the Incident. Incidents may affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s information. For example, a malicious agent may exfiltrate sensitive information. Incident handlers should consider how this information exfiltration will impact the organization’s overall mission. An incident that results in the exfiltration of sensitive information may also affect other organizations if any of the data pertained to a partner organization.  Recoverability from the Incident. The size of the incident and the type of resources it affects will determine the amount of time and resources that must be spent on recovering from that incident. In some instances it is not possible to recover from an incident (e.g., if the confidentiality of sensitive information has been compromised) and it would not make sense to spend limited resources on an elongated incident handling cycle, unless that effort was directed at ensuring that a similar incident did not occur in the future. In other cases, an incident may require far more resources to handle than what an organization has available. Incident handlers should consider the effort necessary to actually recover from an incident and carefully weigh that against the value the recovery effort will create and any requirements related to incident handling.  Combining the functional impact to the organization’s systems and the impact to the organization’s information determines the business impact of the incident—for example, a distributed denial of service attack against a public web server may temporarily reduce the functionality for users attempting to access the server, whereas unauthorized root-level access to a public web server may result in the exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII), which could have a long-lasting impact on the organization’s reputation.  The recoverability from the incident determines the possible responses that the team may take when handling the incident. An incident with a high functional impact and low effort to recover from is an ideal candidate for immediate action from the team. However, some incidents may not have smooth recovery paths and may need to be queued for a more strategic-level response—for example, an incident that results in an attacker exfiltrating and publicly posting gigabytes of sensitive data has no easy recovery path since the data is already exposed; in this case the team may transfer part of the responsibility for handling the data exfiltration incident to a more strategic-level team that develops strategy for preventing future breaches and creates an outreach plan for alerting those individuals or organizations whose data was exfiltrated. The team should prioritize the response to each incident based on its estimate of the business impact caused by the incident and the estimated efforts required to recover from the incident. An organization can best quantify the effect of its own incidents because of its situational awareness.  Table 3-2 provides examples of functional impact categories that an organization might use for rating its own incidents. Rating incidents can be helpful in prioritizing limited resources.  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 33 Table 3-2. Functional Impact Categories Category Definition None No effect to the organization’s ability to provide all services to all users Low Minimal effect; the organization can still provide all critical services to all users but has lost efficiency  Medium Organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a subset of system users High Organization is no longer able to provide some critical services to any users  Table 3-3 provides examples of possible information impact categories that describe the extent of information compromise that occurred during the incident. In this table, with the exception of the ‘None’ value, the categories are not mutually exclusive and the organization could choose more than one. Table 3-3. Information Impact Categories Category Definition None No information was exfiltrated, changed, deleted, or otherwise compromised  Privacy Breach Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) of taxpayers, employees, beneficiaries, etc. was accessed or exfiltrated Proprietary Breach Unclassified proprietary information, such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII), was accessed or exfiltrated Integrity Loss Sensitive or proprietary information was changed or deleted  Table 3-4 shows examples of recoverability effort categories that reflect the level of and type of resources required to recover from the incident. Table 3-4. Recoverability Effort Categories Category Definition Regular Time to recovery is predictable with existing resources Supplemented Time to recovery is predictable with additional resources Extended Time to recovery is unpredictable; additional resources and outside help are needed Not Recoverable Recovery from the incident is not possible (e.g., sensitive data exfiltrated and posted publicly); launch investigation  Organizations should also establish an escalation process for those instances when the team does not respond to an incident within the designated time. This can happen for many reasons: for example, cell phones may fail or people may have personal emergencies. The escalation process should state how long a person should wait for a response and what to do if no response occurs. Generally, the first step is to duplicate the initial contact. After waiting for a brief time—perhaps 15 minutes—the caller should escalate the incident to a higher level, such as the incident response team manager. If that person does not respond within a certain time, then the incident should be escalated again to a higher level of management. This process should be repeated until someone responds. 3.2.7 Incident Notification When an incident is analyzed and prioritized, the incident response team needs to notify the appropriate individuals so that all who need to be involved will play their roles. Incident response policies should COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 34 include provisions concerning incident reporting—at a minimum, what must be reported to whom and at what times (e.g., initial notification, regular status updates). The exact reporting requirements vary among organizations, but parties that are typically notified include:  CIO  Head of information security  Local information security officer  Other incident response teams within the organization  External incident response teams (if appropriate)  System owner  Human resources (for cases involving employees, such as harassment through email)  Public affairs (for incidents that may generate publicity)  Legal department (for incidents with potential legal ramifications)  US-CERT (required for Federal agencies and systems operated on behalf of the Federal government; see Section 2.3.4.3)  Law enforcement (if appropriate) During incident handling, the team may need to provide status updates to certain parties, even in some cases the entire organization. The team should plan and prepare several communication methods, including out-of-band methods (e.g., in person, paper), and select the methods that are appropriate for a particular incident. Possible communication methods include:  Email  Website (internal, external, or portal)  Telephone calls  In person (e.g., daily briefings)  Voice mailbox greeting (e.g., set up a separate voice mailbox for incident updates, and update the greeting message to reflect the current incident status; use the help desk’s voice mail greeting)  Paper (e.g., post notices on bulletin boards and doors, hand out notices at all entrance points). COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 35 3.3 Containment, Eradication, and Recovery  Figure 3-3. Incident Response Life Cycle (Containment, Eradication, and Recovery) 3.3.1 Choosing a Containment Strategy Containment is important before an incident overwhelms resources or increases damage. Most incidents require containment, so that is an important consideration early in the course of handling each incident. Containment provides time for developing a tailored remediation strategy. An essential part of containment is decision-making (e.g., shut down a system, disconnect it from a network, disable certain functions). Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. Organizations should define acceptable risks in dealing with incidents and develop strategies accordingly. Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the strategy for containing an email-borne malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based DDoS attack. Organizations should create separate containment strategies for each major incident type, with criteria documented clearly to facilitate decision-making. Criteria for determining the appropriate strategy include:  Potential damage to and theft of resources  Need for evidence preservation  Service availability (e.g., network connectivity, services provided to external parties)  Time and resources needed to implement the strategy  Effectiveness of the strategy (e.g., partial containment, full containment)  Duration of the solution (e.g., emergency workaround to be removed in four hours, temporary workaround to be removed in two weeks, permanent solution). In certain cases, some organizations redirect the attacker to a sandbox (a form of containment) so that they can monitor the attacker’s activity, usually to gather additional evidence. The incident response team should discuss this strategy with its legal department to determine if it is feasible. Ways of monitoring an COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 36 attacker’s activity other than sandboxing should not be used; if an organization knows that a system has been compromised and allows the compromise to continue, it may be liable if the attacker uses the compromised system to attack other systems. The delayed containment strategy is dangerous because an attacker could escalate unauthorized access or compromise other systems.  Another potential issue regarding containment is that some attacks may cause additional damage when they are contained. For example, a compromised host may run a malicious process that pings another host periodically. When the incident handler attempts to contain the incident by disconnecting the compromised host from the network, the subsequent pings will fail. As a result of the failure, the malicious process may overwrite or encrypt all the data on the host’s hard drive. Handlers should not assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has been prevented. 3.3.2 Evidence Gathering and Handling Although the primary reason for gathering evidence during an incident is to resolve the incident, it may also be needed for legal proceedings.42 In such cases, it is important to clearly document how all evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved.43 Evidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations that have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies so that any evidence can be admissible in court.44 In addition, evidence should be accounted for at all times; whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each party’s signature. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following:  Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer)  Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the investigation  Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling  Locations where the evidence was stored. Collecting evidence from computing resources presents some challenges. It is generally desirable to acquire evidence from a system of interest as soon as one suspects that an incident may have occurred. Many incidents cause a dynamic chain of events to occur; an initial system snapshot may do more good in identifying the problem and its source than most other actions that can be taken at this stage. From an evidentiary standpoint, it is much better to get a snapshot of the system as-is rather than doing so after incident handlers, system administrators, and others have inadvertently altered the state of the machine during the investigation. Users and system administrators should be made aware of the steps that they should take to preserve evidence. See NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response, for additional information on preserving evidence.                                                        42  NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response, provides detailed information on establishing a forensic capability. It focuses on forensic techniques for PCs, but much of the material is applicable to other systems. The document can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-86.  43  Evidence gathering and handling is not typically performed for every incident that occurs—for example, most malware incidents do not merit evidence acquisition. In many organizations, digital forensics is not needed for most incidents. 44  Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations, from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Department of Justice, provides legal guidance on evidence gathering. The document is available at http://www.cybercrime.gov/ssmanual/index.html. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 37 3.3.3 Identifying the Attacking Hosts During incident handling, system owners and others sometimes want to or need to identify the attacking host or hosts. Although this information can be important, incident handlers should generally stay focused on containment, eradication, and recovery. Identifying an attacking host can be a time-consuming and futile process that can prevent a team from achieving its primary goal—minimizing the business impact. The following items describe the most commonly performed activities for attacking host identification:  Validating the Attacking Host’s IP Address. New incident handlers often focus on the attacking host’s IP address. The handler may attempt to validate that the address was not spoofed by verifying connectivity to it; however, this simply indicates that a host at that address does or does not respond to the requests. A failure to respond does not mean the address is not real—for example, a host may be configured to ignore pings and traceroutes. Also, the attacker may have received a dynamic address that has already been reassigned to someone else.  Researching the Attacking Host through Search Engines. Performing an Internet search using the apparent source IP address of an attack may lead to more information on the attack—for example, a mailing list message regarding a similar attack.  Using Incident Databases. Several groups collect and consolidate incident data from various organizations into incident databases. This information sharing may take place in many forms, such as trackers and real-time blacklists. The organization can also check its own knowledge base or issue tracking system for related activity.  Monitoring Possible Attacker Communication Channels. Incident handlers can monitor communication channels that may be used by an attacking host. For example, many bots use IRC as their primary means of communication. Also, attackers may congregate on certain IRC channels to brag about their compromises and share information. However, incident handlers should treat any such information that they acquire only as a potential lead, not as fact. 3.3.4 Eradication and Recovery After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the incident, such as deleting malware and disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During eradication, it is important to identify all affected hosts within the organization so that they can be remediated. For some incidents, eradication is either not necessary or is performed during recovery.  In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems are functioning normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may involve such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening network perimeter security (e.g., firewall rulesets, boundary router access control lists). Higher levels of system logging or network monitoring are often part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully attacked, it is often attacked again, or other resources within the organization are attacked in a similar manner.  Eradication and recovery should be done in a phased approach so that remediation steps are prioritized. For large-scale incidents, recovery may take months; the intent of the early phases should be to increase the overall security with relatively quick (days to weeks) high value changes to prevent future incidents. The later phases should focus on longer-term changes (e.g., infrastructure changes) and ongoing work to keep the enterprise as secure as possible. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 38 Because eradication and recovery actions are typically OS or application-specific, detailed recommendations and advice regarding them are outside the scope of this document. 3.4 Post-Incident Activity  Figure 3-4. Incident Response Life Cycle (Post-Incident Activity) 3.4.1 Lessons Learned One of the most important parts of incident response is also the most often omitted: learning and improving. Each incident response team should evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and lessons learned. Holding a “lessons learned” meeting with all involved parties after a major incident, and optionally periodically after lesser incidents as resources permit, can be extremely helpful in improving security measures and the incident handling process itself. Multiple incidents can be covered in a single lessons learned meeting. This meeting provides a chance to achieve closure with respect to an incident by reviewing what occurred, what was done to intervene, and how well intervention worked. The meeting should be held within several days of the end of the incident. Questions to be answered in the meeting include:  Exactly what happened, and at what times?  How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate?  What information was needed sooner?  Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?  What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs?  How could information sharing with other organizations have been improved?  What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?  What precursors or indicators should be watched for in the future to detect similar incidents? COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 39  What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents? Small incidents need limited post-incident analysis, with the exception of incidents performed through new attack methods that are of widespread concern and interest. After serious attacks have occurred, it is usually worthwhile to hold post-mortem meetings that cross team and organizational boundaries to provide a mechanism for information sharing. The primary consideration in holding such meetings is ensuring that the right people are involved. Not only is it important to invite people who have been involved in the incident that is being analyzed, but also it is wise to consider who should be invited for the purpose of facilitating future cooperation. The success of such meetings also depends on the agenda. Collecting input about expectations and needs (including suggested topics to cover) from participants before the meeting increases the likelihood that the participants’ needs will be met. In addition, establishing rules of order before or during the start of a meeting can minimize confusion and discord. Having one or more moderators who are skilled in group facilitation can yield a high payoff. Finally, it is also important to document the major points of agreement and action items and to communicate them to parties who could not attend the meeting. Lessons learned meetings provide other benefits. Reports from these meetings are good material for training new team members by showing them how more experienced team members respond to incidents. Updating incident response policies and procedures is another important part of the lessons learned process. Post-mortem analysis of the way an incident was handled will often reveal a missing step or an inaccuracy in a procedure, providing impetus for change. Because of the changing nature of information technology and changes in personnel, the incident response team should review all related documentation and procedures for handling incidents at designated intervals. Another important post-incident activity is creating a follow-up report for each incident, which can be quite valuable for future use. The report provides a reference that can be used to assist in handling similar incidents. Creating a formal chronology of events (including timestamped information such as log data from systems) is important for legal reasons, as is creating a monetary estimate of the amount of damage the incident caused. This estimate may become the basis for subsequent prosecution activity by entities such as the U.S. Attorney General’s office. Follow-up reports should be kept for a period of time as specified in record retention policies.45 3.4.2 Using Collected Incident Data Lessons learned activities should produce a set of objective and subjective data regarding each incident. Over time, the collected incident data should be useful in several capacities. The data, particularly the total hours of involvement and the cost, may be used to justify additional funding of the incident response team. A study of incident characteristics may indicate systemic security weaknesses and threats, as well as changes in incident trends. This data can be put back into the risk assessment process, ultimately leading to the selection and implementation of additional controls. Another good use of the data is measuring the success of the incident response team. If incident data is collected and stored properly, it should provide several measures of the success (or at least the activities) of the incident response team. Incident data can also be collected to determine if a change to incident response capabilities causes a corresponding change in the team’s performance (e.g., improvements in efficiency, reductions in costs). Furthermore, organizations that are required to report incident information will need to collect the                                                       45  General Records Schedule (GRS) 24, Information Technology Operations and Management Records, specifies that “computer security incident handling, reporting and follow-up records” should be destroyed “3 years after all necessary follow-up actions have been completed.” GRS 24 is available from the National Archives and Records Administration at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs24.html. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 40 necessary data to meet their requirements. See Section 4 for additional information on sharing incident data with other organizations. Organizations should focus on collecting data that is actionable, rather than collecting data simply because it is available. For example, counting the number of precursor port scans that occur each week and producing a chart at the end of the year that shows port scans increased by eight percent is not very helpful and may be quite time-consuming. Absolute numbers are not informative—understanding how they represent threats to the business processes of the organization is what matters. Organizations should decide what incident data to collect based on reporting requirements and on the expected return on investment from the data (e.g., identifying a new threat and mitigating the related vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.) Possible metrics for incident-related data include:  Number of Incidents Handled.46 Handling more incidents is not necessarily better—for example, the number of incidents handled may decrease because of better network and host security controls, not because of negligence by the incident response team. The number of incidents handled is best taken as a measure of the relative amount of work that the incident response team had to perform, not as a measure of the quality of the team, unless it is considered in the context of other measures that collectively give an indication of work quality. It is more effective to produce separate incident counts for each incident category. Subcategories also can be used to provide more information. For example, a growing number of incidents performed by insiders could prompt stronger policy provisions concerning background investigations for personnel and misuse of computing resources and stronger security controls on internal networks (e.g., deploying intrusion detection software to more internal networks and hosts).  Time Per Incident. For each incident, time can be measured in several ways: – Total amount of labor spent working on the incident – Elapsed time from the beginning of the incident to incident discovery, to the initial impact assessment, and to each stage of the incident handling process (e.g., containment, recovery) – How long it took the incident response team to respond to the initial report of the incident – How long it took to report the incident to management and, if necessary, appropriate external entities (e.g., US-CERT).  Objective Assessment of Each Incident. The response to an incident that has been resolved can be analyzed to determine how effective it was. The following are examples of performing an objective assessment of an incident: – Reviewing logs, forms, reports, and other incident documentation for adherence to established incident response policies and procedures – Identifying which precursors and indicators of the incident were recorded to determine how effectively the incident was logged and identified – Determining if the incident caused damage before it was detected                                                       46  Metrics such as the number of incidents handled are generally not of value in a comparison of multiple organizations because each organization is likely to have defined key terms differently. For example, most organizations define “incident” in terms of their own policies and practices, and what one organization considers a single incident may be considered multiple incidents by others. More specific metrics, such as the number of port scans, are also of little value in organizational comparisons. For example, it is highly unlikely that different security systems, such as network intrusion detection sensors, would all use the same criteria in labeling activity as a port scan. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 41 – Determining if the actual cause of the incident was identified, and identifying the vector of attack, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the characteristics of the targeted or victimized systems, networks, and applications – Determining if the incident is a recurrence of a previous incident – Calculating the estimated monetary damage from the incident (e.g., information and critical business processes negatively affected by the incident) – Measuring the difference between the initial impact assessment and the final impact assessment (see Section 3.2.6) – Identifying which measures, if any, could have prevented the incident.  Subjective Assessment of Each Incident. Incident response team members may be asked to assess their own performance, as well as that of other team members and of the entire team. Another valuable source of input is the owner of a resource that was attacked, in order to determine if the owner thinks the incident was handled efficiently and if the outcome was satisfactory. Besides using these metrics to measure the team’s success, organizations may also find it useful to periodically audit their incident response programs. Audits will identify problems and deficiencies that can then be corrected. At a minimum, an incident response audit should evaluate the following items against applicable regulations, policies, and generally accepted practices:  Incident response policies, plans, and procedures  Tools and resources  Team model and structure  Incident handler training and education  Incident documentation and reports  The measures of success discussed earlier in this section. 3.4.3 Evidence Retention Organizations should establish policy for how long evidence from an incident should be retained. Most organizations choose to retain all evidence for months or years after the incident ends. The following factors should be considered during the policy creation:  Prosecution. If it is possible that the attacker will be prosecuted, evidence may need to be retained until all legal actions have been completed. In some cases, this may take several years. Furthermore, evidence that seems insignificant now may become more important in the future. For example, if an attacker is able to use knowledge gathered in one attack to perform a more severe attack later, evidence from the first attack may be key to explaining how the second attack was accomplished.  Data Retention. Most organizations have data retention policies that state how long certain types of data may be kept. For example, an organization may state that email messages should be retained for only 180 days. If a disk image contains thousands of emails, the organization may not want the image to be kept for more than 180 days unless it is absolutely necessary. As discussed in Section 3.4.2, General Records Schedule (GRS) 24 specifies that incident handling records should be kept for three years. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 42  Cost. Original hardware (e.g., hard drives, compromised systems) that is stored as evidence, as well as hard drives and removable media that are used to hold disk images, are generally individually inexpensive. However, if an organization stores many such components for years, the cost can be substantial. The organization also must retain functional computers that can use the stored hardware and media. 3.5 Incident Handling Checklist The checklist in Table 3-6 provides the major steps to be performed in the handling of an incident. Note that the actual steps performed may vary based on the type of incident and the nature of individual incidents. For example, if the handler knows exactly what has happened based on analysis of indicators (Step 1.1), there may be no need to perform Steps 1.2 or 1.3 to further research the activity. The checklist provides guidelines to handlers on the major steps that should be performed; it does not dictate the exact sequence of steps that should always be followed. Table 3-5.

Hold a lessons learned meeting (mandatory for major incidents, optional otherwise)   3.6 Recommendations The key recommendations presented in this section for handling incidents are summarized below. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 43  Acquire tools and resources that may be of value during incident handling. The team will be more efficient at handling incidents if various tools and resources are already available to them. Examples include contact lists, encryption software, network diagrams, backup devices, digital forensic software, and port lists.  Prevent incidents from occurring by ensuring that networks, systems, and applications are sufficiently secure. Preventing incidents is beneficial to the organization and also reduces the workload of the incident response team. Performing periodic risk assessments and reducing the identified risks to an acceptable level are effective in reducing the number of incidents. Awareness of security policies and procedures by users, IT staff, and management is also very important.  Identify precursors and indicators through alerts generated by several types of security software. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and file integrity checking software are valuable for detecting signs of incidents. Each type of software may detect incidents that the other types of software cannot, so the use of several types of computer security software is highly recommended. Third-party monitoring services can also be helpful.  Establish mechanisms for outside parties to report incidents. Outside parties may want to report incidents to the organization—for example, they may believe that one of the organization’s users is attacking them. Organizations should publish a phone number and email address that outside parties can use to report such incidents.  Require a baseline level of logging and auditing on all systems, and a higher baseline level on all critical systems. Logs from operating systems, services, and applications frequently provide value during incident analysis, particularly if auditing was enabled. The logs can provide information such as which accounts were accessed and what actions were performed.  Profile networks and systems. Profiling measures the characteristics of expected activity levels so that changes in patterns can be more easily identified. If the profiling process is automated, deviations from expected activity levels can be detected and reported to administrators quickly, leading to faster detection of incidents and operational issues.  Understand the normal behaviors of networks, systems, and applications. Team members who understand normal behavior should be able to recognize abnormal behavior more easily. This knowledge can best be gained by reviewing log entries and security alerts; the handlers should become familiar with the typical data and can investigate the unusual entries to gain more knowledge.  Create a log retention policy. Information regarding an incident may be recorded in several places. Creating and implementing a log retention policy that specifies how long log data should be maintained may be extremely helpful in analysis because older log entries may show reconnaissance activity or previous instances of similar attacks.  Perform event correlation. Evidence of an incident may be captured in several logs. Correlating events among multiple sources can be invaluable in collecting all the available information for an incident and validating whether the incident occurred.   Keep all host clocks synchronized. If the devices reporting events have inconsistent clock settings, event correlation will be more complicated. Clock discrepancies may also cause issues from an evidentiary standpoint.  Maintain and use a knowledge base of information. Handlers need to reference information quickly during incident analysis; a centralized knowledge base provides a consistent, maintainable source of information. The knowledge base should include general information, such as data on precursors and indicators of previous incidents. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 44  Start recording all information as soon as the team suspects that an incident has occurred. Every step taken, from the time the incident was detected to its final resolution, should be documented and timestamped. Information of this nature can serve as evidence in a court of law if legal prosecution is pursued. Recording the steps performed can also lead to a more efficient, systematic, and less error-prone handling of the problem.  Safeguard incident data. It often contains sensitive information regarding such things as vulnerabilities, security breaches, and users that may have performed inappropriate actions. The team should ensure that access to incident data is restricted properly, both logically and physically.  Prioritize handling of the incidents based on the relevant factors. Because of resource limitations, incidents should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, organizations should establish written guidelines that outline how quickly the team must respond to the incident and what actions should be performed, based on relevant factors such as the functional and information impact of the incident, and the likely recoverability from the incident. This saves time for the incident handlers and provides a justification to management and system owners for their actions. Organizations should also establish an escalation process for those instances when the team does not respond to an incident within the designated time.  Include provisions regarding incident reporting in the organization’s incident response policy. Organizations should specify which incidents must be reported, when they must be reported, and to whom. The parties most commonly notified are the CIO, head of information security, local information security officer, other incident response teams within the organization, and system owners.  Establish strategies and procedures for containing incidents. It is important to contain incidents quickly and effectively to limit their business impact. Organizations should define acceptable risks in containing incidents and develop strategies and procedures accordingly. Containment strategies should vary based on the type of incident.  Follow established procedures for evidence gathering and handling. The team should clearly document how all evidence has been preserved. Evidence should be accounted for at all times. The team should meet with legal staff and law enforcement agencies to discuss evidence handling, then develop procedures based on those discussions.  Capture volatile data from systems as evidence. This includes lists of network connections, processes, login sessions, open files, network interface configurations, and the contents of memory. Running carefully chosen commands from trusted media can collect the necessary information without damaging the system’s evidence.  Obtain system snapshots through full forensic disk images, not file system backups. Disk images should be made to sanitized write-protectable or write-once media. This process is superior to a file system backup for investigatory and evidentiary purposes. Imaging is also valuable in that it is much safer to analyze an image than it is to perform analysis on the original system because the analysis may inadvertently alter the original.  Hold lessons learned meetings after major incidents. Lessons learned meetings are extremely helpful in improving security measures and the incident handling process itself.COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 45 4. Coordination and Information Sharing The nature of contemporary threats and attacks makes it more important than ever for organizations to work together during incident response. Organizations should ensure that they effectively coordinate portions of their incident response activities with appropriate partners. The most important aspect of incident response coordination is information sharing, where different organizations share threat, attack, and vulnerability information with each other so that each organization’s knowledge benefits the other. Incident information sharing is frequently mutually beneficial because the same threats and attacks often affect multiple organizations simultaneously.  As mentioned in Section 2, coordinating and sharing information with partner organizations can strengthen the organization’s ability to effectively respond to IT incidents. For example, if an organization identifies some behavior on its network that seems suspicious and sends information about the event to a set of trusted partners, someone else in that network may have already seen similar behavior and be able to respond with additional details about the suspicious activity, including signatures, other indicators to look for, or suggested remediation actions. Collaboration with the trusted partner can enable an organization to respond to the incident more quickly and efficiently than an organization operating in isolation.  This increase in efficiency for standard incident response techniques is not the only incentive for cross-organization coordination and information sharing. Another incentive for information sharing is the ability to respond to incidents using techniques that may not be available to a single organization, especially if that organization is small to medium size. For example, a small organization that identifies a particularly complex instance of malware on its network may not have the in-house resources to fully analyze the malware and determine its effect on the system. In this case, the organization may be able to leverage a trusted information sharing network to effectively outsource the analysis of this malware to third party resources that have the adequate technical capabilities to perform the malware analysis.  This section of the document highlights coordination and information sharing. Section 4.1 presents an overview of incident response coordination and focuses on the need for cross-organization coordination to supplement organization incident response processes. Section 4.2 discusses techniques for information sharing across organizations, and Section 4.3 examines how to restrict what information is shared or not shared with other organizations.  4.1 Coordination As discussed in Section 2.3.4, an organization may need to interact with several types of external organizations in the course of conducting incident response activities. Examples of these organizations include other incident response teams, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and constituents and customers. An organization’s incident response team should plan its incident coordination with those parties before incidents occur to ensure that all parties know their roles and that effective lines of communication are established. Figure 4-1 provides a sample view into an organization performing coordination at every phase of the incident response lifecycle, highlighting that coordination is valuable throughout the lifecycle.  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 46  Figure 4-1. Incident Response Coordination  4.1.1 Coordination Relationships An incident response team within an organization may participate in different types of coordination arrangements, depending on the type of organization with which it is coordinating. For example, the team members responsible for the technical details of incident response may coordinate with operational colleagues at partner organizations to share strategies for mitigating an attack spanning multiple organizations. Alternatively, during the same incident, the incident response team manager may coordinate with ISACs to satisfy necessary reporting requirements and seek advice and additional resources for successfully responding to the incident. Table 4-1 provides some examples of coordination relationships that may exist when collaborating with outside organizations.  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 47 Table 4-1. Coordination Relationships Category Definition Information Shared Team-to-team Team-to-team relationships exist whenever technical incident responders in different organizations collaborate with their peers during any phase of the incident handling life cycle. The organizations participating in this type of relationship are usually peers without any authority over each other and choose to share information, pool resources, and reuse knowledge to solve problems common to both teams. The information most frequently shared in team-to-team relationships is tactical and technical (e.g., technical indicators of compromise, suggested remediation actions) but may also include other types of information (plans, procedures, lessons learned) if conducted as part of the Preparation phase. Team-to-coordinating team Team-to-coordinating team relationships exist between an organizational incident response team and a separate organization that acts as a central point for coordinated incident response and management such as US-CERT or an ISAC. This type of relationship may include some degree of required reporting from the member organizations by the coordinating body, as well as the expectation that the coordinating team will disseminate timely and useful information to participating member organizations. Teams and coordinating teams frequently share tactical, technical information as well as information regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to the community served by the coordinating team. The coordinating team may also need specific impact information about incidents in order to help make decisions on where to focus its resources and attention. Coordinating team-to-coordinating team Relationships between multiple coordinating teams such as US-CERT and the ISACs exist to share information relating to cross-cutting incidents which may affect multiple communities. The coordinating teams act on behalf of their respective community member organizations to share information on the nature and scope of cross-cutting incidents and reusable mitigation strategies to assist in inter-community response. The type of information shared by coordinating teams with their counterparts often consists of periodical summaries during “steady state” operations, punctuated by the exchange of tactical, technical details, response plans, and impact or risk assessment information during coordinated incident response activities.  Organizations may find it challenging to build the relationships needed for coordination. Good places to start building a community include the industry sector that the organization belongs to and the geographic region where the organization operates. An organization’s incident response team can try to form relationships with other teams (at the team-to-team level) within its own industry sector and region, or join established bodies within the industry sector that already facilitate information sharing. Another consideration for building relationships is that some relationships are mandatory and others voluntary; for example, team-to-coordinating team relationships are often mandatory, while team-to-team relationships are usually voluntary. Organizations pursue voluntary relationships because they fulfill mutual self-interests. Mandatory relationships are usually defined by a regulatory body within the industry or by another entity.  4.1.2 Sharing Agreements and Reporting Requirements Organizations trying to share information with external organizations should consult with their legal department before initiating any coordination efforts. There may be contracts or other agreements that need to be put into place before discussions occur. An example is a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to protect the confidentiality of the organization’s most sensitive information. Organizations should also consider any existing requirements for reporting, such as sharing incident information with an ISAC or reporting incidents to a higher-level CIRT. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 48  4.2 Information Sharing Techniques Information sharing is a key element of enabling coordination across organizations. Even the smallest organizations need to be able to share incident information with peers and partners in order to deal with many incidents effectively. Organizations should perform such information sharing throughout the incident response life cycle and not wait until an incident has been fully resolved before sharing details of it with others. Section 4.3 discusses the types of incident information that organizations may or may not want to share with others.  This section focuses on techniques for information sharing. Section 4.2.1 looks at ad hoc methods, while Section 4.2.2 examines partially automated methods. Finally, Section 4.2.3 discusses security considerations related to information sharing.  4.2.1 Ad Hoc Most incident information sharing has traditionally occurred through ad hoc methods, such as email, instant messaging clients, and phone. Ad hoc information sharing mechanisms normally rely on an individual employee’s connections with employees in incident response teams of partner organizations. The employee uses these connections to manually share information with peers and coordinate with them to construct strategies for responding to an incident. Depending on the size of the organization, these ad hoc techniques may be the most cost-effective way of sharing information with partner organizations. However, due to the informal nature of ad hoc information sharing, it is not possible to guarantee that the information sharing processes will always operate. For example, if a particularly well-connected employee resigns from an incident response team, that team may temporarily lose the majority of information sharing channels it relies on to effectively coordinate with outside organizations.  Ad hoc information sharing methods are also largely unstandardized in terms of what information is communicated and how that communication occurs. Because of the lack of standardization, they tend to require manual intervention and to be more resource-intensive to process than the alternative, partially automated methods. Whenever possible an organization should attempt to formalize its information sharing strategies through formal agreements with partner organizations and technical mechanisms that will help to partially automate the sharing of information.  4.2.2 Partially Automated Organizations should attempt to automate as much of the information sharing process as possible to make cross-organizational coordination efficient and cost effective. In reality, it will not be possible to fully automate the sharing of all incident information, nor will it be desirable due to security and trust considerations. Organizations should attempt to achieve a balance of automated information sharing overlaid with human-centric processes for managing the information flow.  When engineering automated information sharing solutions, organizations should first consider what types of information they will communicate with partners. The organization may want to construct a formal data dictionary enumerating all entities and relationships between entities that they will wish to share. Once the organization understands the types of information they will share, it is necessary to construct formal, machine-processable models to capture this information. Wherever possible, an organization should use existing data exchange standards for representing the information they need to COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 49 share.47 The organization should work with its partner organizations when deciding on the data exchange models to ensure that the standards selected are compatible with the partner organization’s incident response systems. When selecting existing data exchange models, organizations may prefer to select multiple models that model different aspects of the incident response domain and then leverage these models in a modular fashion, communicating only the information needed at a specific decision point in the life cycle. Appendix E provides a non-exhaustive list of existing standards defining data exchange models that are applicable to the incident response domain.  In addition to selecting the data exchange models for sharing incident information, an organization must also work with its partner organizations to agree on the technical transport mechanisms for enabling the information exchange to occur in an automated fashion. These transport mechanisms include, at a minimum, the transport protocol for exchanging the information, the architectural model for communicating with an information resource, and the applicable ports and domain names for accessing an information resource in a particular organization. For example, a group of partner organizations may decide to exchange incident information using a Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture to exchange IODEF/Real-Time Inter-Network Defense (RID) data over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) on port 4590 of a specific domain name within each organization’s DMZ.  4.2.3 Security Considerations There are several security considerations that incident response teams should consider when planning their information sharing. One is being able to designate who can see which pieces of incident information (e.g., protection of sensitive information). It may also be necessary to perform data sanitization or scrubbing to remove sensitive pieces of data from the incident information without disturbing the information on precursors, indicators, and other technical information. See Section 4.3 for more information on granular information sharing. The incident response team should also ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect information shared with the team by other organizations.  There are also many legal issues to consider regarding data sharing. See Section 4.1.2 for additional information.  4.3 Granular Information Sharing Organizations need to balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive information, ideally sharing the necessary information and only the necessary information with the appropriate parties. Organizations can think of their incident information as being comprised of two types of information: business impact and technical. Business impact information is often shared in the context of a team-to-coordinating-team relationship as defined in Section 4.1.1, while technical information is often shared within all three types of coordination relationships. This section discusses both types of information and provides recommendations for performing granular information sharing. 4.3.1 Business Impact Information Business impact information involves how the incident is affecting the organization in terms of mission impact, financial impact, etc. Such information, at least at a summary level, is often reported to higher-level coordinating incident response teams to communicate an estimate of the damage caused by the incident. Coordinating response teams may need this impact information to make decisions regarding the                                                       47  According to the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA), “all Federal agencies and departments shall use technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies”. See http://standards.gov/nttaa.cfm for more details. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 50 degree of assistance to provide to the reporting organization. A coordinating team may also use this information to make decisions relative to how a specific incident will affect other organizations in the community they represent.   Coordinating teams may require member organizations to report on some degree of business impact information. For example, a coordinating team may require a member organization to report impact information using the categories defined in Section 3.2.6. In this case, for a hypothetical incident an organization would report that it has a functional impact of medium, an information impact of none, and will require extended recoverability time. This high-level information would alert the coordinating team that the member organization requires some level of additional resources to recover from the incident. The coordinating team could then pursue additional communication with the member organization to determine how many resources are required as well as the type of resources based on the technical information provided about the incident.  Business impact information is only useful for reporting to organizations that have some interest in ensuring the mission of the organization experiencing the incident. In many cases, incident response teams should avoid sharing business impact information with outside organizations unless there is a clear value proposition or formal reporting requirements. When sharing information with peer and partner organizations, incident response teams should focus on exchanging technical information as outlined in Section 4.3.2.  4.3.2 Technical Information There are many different types of technical indicators signifying the occurrence of an incident within an organization. These indicators originate from the variety of technical information associated with incidents, such as the hostnames and IP addresses of attacking hosts, samples of malware, precursors and indicators of similar incidents, and types of vulnerabilities exploited in an incident. Section 3.2.2 provides an overview of how organizations should collect and utilize these indicators to help identify an incident that is in progress. In addition, Section 3.2.3 provides a listing of common sources of incident indicator data.   While organizations gain value from collecting their own internal indicators, they may gain additional value from analyzing indicators received from partner organizations and sharing internal indicators for external analysis and use. If the organization receives external indicator data pertaining to an incident they have not seen, they can use that indicator data to identify the incident as it begins to occur. Similarly, an organization may use external indicator data to detect an ongoing incident that it was not aware of due to the lack of internal resources to capture the specific indicator data. Organizations may also benefit from sharing their internal indicator data with external organizations. For example, if they share technical information pertaining to an incident they are experiencing, a partner organization may respond with a suggested remediation strategy for handling that incident.  Organizations should share as much of this information as possible; however, there may be both security and liability reasons why an organization would not want to reveal the details of an exploited vulnerability. External indicators, such as the general characteristics of attacks and the identity of attacking hosts, are usually safe to share with others. Organizations should consider which types of technical information should or should not be shared with various parties, and then endeavor to share as much of the appropriate information as possible with other organizations.  Technical indicator data is useful when it allows an organization to identify an actual incident. However, not all indicator data received from external sources will pertain to the organization receiving it. In some COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 51 cases, this external data will generate false positives within the receiving organization's network and may cause resources to be spent on nonexistent problems.   Organizations participating in incident information sharing should have staff skilled in taking technical indicator information from sharing communities and disseminating that information throughout the enterprise, preferably in an automated way. Organizations should also attempt to ensure that they only share an indicator for which they have a relatively high level of confidence that it signifies an actual incident.  4.4 Recommendations The key recommendations presented in this section for handling incidents are summarized below.  Plan incident coordination with external parties before incidents occur. Examples of external parties include other incident response teams, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and constituents and customers. This planning helps ensure that all parties know their roles and that effective lines of communication are established.   Consult with the legal department before initiating any coordination efforts. There may be contracts or other agreements that need to be put into place before discussions occur.   Perform incident information sharing throughout the incident response life cycle.

The incident response team or team members are presented with a scenario and a list of related questions. The team then discusses each question and determines the most likely answer. The goal is to determine what the team would really do and to compare that with policies, procedures, and generally recommended practices to identify discrepancies or deficiencies. For example, the answer to one question may indicate that the response would be delayed because the team lacks a piece of software or because another team does not provide off-hours support. The questions listed below are applicable to almost any scenario. Each question is followed by a reference to the related section(s) of the document. After the questions are scenarios, each of which is followed by additional incident-specific questions. Organizations are strongly encouraged to adapt these questions and scenarios for use in their own incident response exercises.48 A.1 Scenario Questions Preparation: 1. Would the organization consider this activity to be an incident? If so, which of the organization’s policies does this activity violate? (Section 2.1) 2.

What aspects of the handling would have been different if the incident had occurred at a different physical location (onsite versus offsite)? (Section 2.4.2) A.2 Scenarios Scenario 1: Domain Name System (DNS) Server Denial of Service (DoS) On a Saturday afternoon, external users start having problems accessing the organization’s public websites. Over the next hour, the problem worsens to the point where nearly every access attempt fails. Meanwhile, a member of the organization’s networking staff responds to alerts from an Internet border router and determines that the organization’s Internet bandwidth is being consumed by an unusually large volume of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to and from both the organization’s public DNS servers. Analysis of the traffic shows that the DNS servers are receiving high volumes of requests from a single external IP address. Also, all the DNS requests from that address come from the same source port.  The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. Whom should the organization contact regarding the external IP address in question? 2. Suppose that after the initial containment measures were put in place, the network administrators detected that nine internal hosts were also attempting the same unusual requests to the DNS server. How would that affect the handling of this incident? 3. Suppose that two of the nine internal hosts disconnected from the network before their system owners were identified. How would the system owners be identified? Scenario 2: Worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation On a Tuesday morning, a new worm is released; it spreads itself through removable media, and it can copy itself to open Windows shares. When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. The COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 54 organization has already incurred widespread infections before antivirus signatures become available several hours after the worm started to spread. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. How would the incident response team identify all infected hosts? 2. How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from entering the organization before antivirus signatures were released? 3. How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from being spread by infected hosts before antivirus signatures were released? 4. Would the organization attempt to patch all vulnerable machines? If so, how would this be done? 5. How would the handling of this incident change if infected hosts that had received the DDoS agent had been configured to attack another organization’s website the next morning? 6. How would the handling of this incident change if one or more of the infected hosts contained sensitive personally identifiable information regarding the organization’s employees? 7. How would the incident response team keep the organization’s users informed about the status of the incident? 8. What additional measures would the team perform for hosts that are not currently connected to the network (e.g., staff members on vacation, offsite employees who connect occasionally)? Scenario 3: Stolen Documents On a Monday morning, the organization’s legal department receives a call from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding some suspicious activity involving the organization’s systems. Later that day, an FBI agent meets with members of management and the legal department to discuss the activity. The FBI has been investigating activity involving public posting of sensitive government documents, and some of the documents reportedly belong to the organization. The agent asks for the organization’s assistance, and management asks for the incident response team’s assistance in acquiring the necessary evidence to determine if these documents are legitimate or not and how they might have been leaked.  The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. From what sources might the incident response team gather evidence? 2. What would the team do to keep the investigation confidential? 3. How would the handling of this incident change if the team identified an internal host responsible for the leaks? 4. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found a rootkit installed on the internal host responsible for the leaks? Scenario 4: Compromised Database Server On a Tuesday night, a database administrator performs some off-hours maintenance on several production database servers. The administrator notices some unfamiliar and unusual directory names on one of the servers. After reviewing the directory listings and viewing some of the files, the administrator concludes that the server has been attacked and calls the incident response team for assistance. The team’s investigation determines that the attacker successfully gained root access to the server six weeks ago. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. What sources might the team use to determine when the compromise had occurred? COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 55 2. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found that the database server had been running a packet sniffer and capturing passwords from the network? 3. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found that the server was running a process that would copy a database containing sensitive customer information (including personally identifiable information) each night and transfer it to an external address? 4. How would the handling of this incident change if the team discovered a rootkit on the server? Scenario 5: Unknown Exfiltration On a Sunday night, one of the organization’s network intrusion detection sensors alerts on anomalous outbound network activity involving large file transfers. The intrusion analyst reviews the alerts; it appears that thousands of .RAR files are being copied from an internal host to an external host, and the external host is located in another country. The analyst contacts the incident response team so that it can investigate the activity further. The team is unable to see what the .RAR files hold because their contents are encrypted. Analysis of the internal host containing the .RAR files shows signs of a bot installation.  The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. How would the team determine what was most likely inside the .RAR files? Which other teams might assist the incident response team? 2. If the incident response team determined that the initial compromise had been performed through a wireless network card in the internal host, how would the team further investigate this activity? 3. If the incident response team determined that the internal host was being used to stage sensitive files from other hosts within the enterprise, how would the team further investigate this activity? Scenario 6: Unauthorized Access to Payroll Records On a Wednesday evening, the organization’s physical security team receives a call from a payroll administrator who saw an unknown person leave her office, run down the hallway, and exit the building. The administrator had left her workstation unlocked and unattended for only a few minutes. The payroll program is still logged in and on the main menu, as it was when she left it, but the administrator notices that the mouse appears to have been moved. The incident response team has been asked to acquire evidence related to the incident and to determine what actions were performed. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. How would the team determine what actions had been performed? 2. How would the handling of this incident differ if the payroll administrator had recognized the person leaving her office as a former payroll department employee? 3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the team had reason to believe that the person was a current employee? 4. How would the handling of this incident differ if the physical security team determined that the person had used social engineering techniques to gain physical access to the building? 5. How would the handling of this incident differ if logs from the previous week showed an unusually large number of failed remote login attempts using the payroll administrator’s user ID? 6. How would the handling of this incident differ if the incident response team discovered that a keystroke logger was installed on the computer two weeks earlier? COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 56 Scenario 7: Disappearing Host On a Thursday afternoon, a network intrusion detection sensor records vulnerability scanning activity directed at internal hosts that is being generated by an internal IP address. Because the intrusion detection analyst is unaware of any authorized, scheduled vulnerability scanning activity, she reports the activity to the incident response team. When the team begins the analysis, it discovers that the activity has stopped and that there is no longer a host using the IP address. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. What data sources might contain information regarding the identity of the vulnerability scanning host? 2. How would the team identify who had been performing the vulnerability scans? 3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at the organization’s most critical hosts? 4. How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at external hosts? 5. How would the handling of this incident differ if the internal IP address was associated with the organization’s wireless guest network? 6. How would the handling of this incident differ if the physical security staff discovered that someone had broken into the facility half an hour before the vulnerability scanning occurred? Scenario 8: Telecommuting Compromise On a Saturday night, network intrusion detection software records an inbound connection originating from a watchlist IP address. The intrusion detection analyst determines that the connection is being made to the organization’s VPN server and contacts the incident response team. The team reviews the intrusion detection, firewall, and VPN server logs and identifies the user ID that was authenticated for the session and the name of the user associated with the user ID. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. What should the team’s next step be (e.g., calling the user at home, disabling the user ID, disconnecting the VPN session)? Why should this step be performed first? What step should be performed second? 2. How would the handling of this incident differ if the external IP address belonged to an open proxy? 3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the ID had been used to initiate VPN connections from several external IP addresses without the knowledge of the user? 4. Suppose that the identified user’s computer had become compromised by a game containing a Trojan horse that was downloaded by a family member. How would this affect the team’s analysis of the incident? How would this affect evidence gathering and handling? What should the team do in terms of eradicating the incident from the user’s computer? 5. Suppose that the user installed antivirus software and determined that the Trojan horse had included a keystroke logger. How would this affect the handling of the incident? How would this affect the handling of the incident if the user were a system administrator? How would this affect the handling of the incident if the user were a high-ranking executive in the organization? COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 57 Scenario 9: Anonymous Threat On a Thursday afternoon, the organization’s physical security team receives a call from an IT manager, reporting that two of her employees just received anonymous threats against the organization’s systems. Based on an investigation, the physical security team believes that the threats should be taken seriously and notifies the appropriate internal teams, including the incident response team, of the threats. The following are additional questions for this scenario: 1. What should the incident response team do differently, if anything, in response to the notification of the threats? 2. What impact could heightened physical security controls have on the team’s responses to incidents? Scenario 10: Peer-to-Peer File Sharing The organization prohibits the use of peer-to-peer file sharing services. The organization’s network intrusion detection sensors have signatures enabled that can detect the usage of several popular peer-to-peer file sharing services. On a Monday evening, an intrusion detection analyst notices that several file sharing alerts have occurred during the past three hours, all involving the same internal IP address. 1. What factors should be used to prioritize the handling of this incident (e.g., the apparent content of the files that are being shared)? 2. What privacy considerations may impact the handling of this incident? 3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the computer performing peer-to-peer file sharing also contains sensitive personally identifiable information? Scenario 11: Unknown Wireless Access Point On a Monday morning, the organization’s help desk receives calls from three users on the same floor of a building who state that they are having problems with their wireless access. A network administrator who is asked to assist in resolving the problem brings a laptop with wireless access to the users’ floor. As he views his wireless networking configuration, he notices that there is a new access point listed as being available. He checks with his teammates and determines that this access point was not deployed by his team, so that it is most likely a rogue access point that was established without permission. 1. What should be the first major step in handling this incident (e.g., physically finding the rogue access point, logically attaching to the access point)? 2. What is the fastest way to locate the access point? What is the most covert way to locate the access point? 3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the access point had been deployed by an external party (e.g., contractor) temporarily working at the organization’s office? 4. How would the handling of this incident differ if an intrusion detection analyst reported signs of suspicious activity involving some of the workstations on the same floor of the building? 5. How would the handling of this incident differ if the access point had been removed while the team was still attempting to physically locate it?   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 58 Appendix B—Incident-Related Data Elements Organizations should identify a standard set of incident-related data elements to be collected for each incident. This effort will not only facilitate more effective and consistent incident handling, but also assist the organization in meeting applicable incident reporting requirements. The organization should designate a set of basic elements (e.g., incident reporter’s name, phone number, and location) to be collected when the incident is reported and an additional set of elements to be collected by the incident handlers during their response. The two sets of elements would be the basis for the incident reporting database, previously discussed in Section 3.2.5. The lists below provide suggestions of what information to collect for incidents and are not intended to be comprehensive. Each organization should create its own list of elements based on several factors, including its incident response team model and structure and its definition of the term “incident.” B.1 Basic Data Elements  Contact Information for the Incident Reporter and Handler – Name – Role – Organizational unit (e.g., agency, department, division, team) and affiliation – Email address – Phone number – Location (e.g., mailing address, office room number)  Incident Details – Status change date/timestamps (including time zone): when the incident started, when the incident was discovered/detected, when the incident was reported, when the incident was resolved/ended, etc. – Physical location of the incident (e.g., city, state) – Current status of the incident (e.g., ongoing attack) – Source/cause of the incident (if known), including hostnames and IP addresses – Description of the incident (e.g., how it was detected, what occurred) – Description of affected resources (e.g., networks, hosts, applications, data), including systems’ hostnames, IP addresses, and function – If known, incident category, vectors of attack associated with the incident, and indicators related to the incident (traffic patterns, registry keys, etc.) – Prioritization factors (functional impact, information impact, recoverability, etc.) – Mitigating factors (e.g., stolen laptop containing sensitive data was using full disk encryption) – Response actions performed (e.g., shut off host, disconnected host from network) – Other organizations contacted (e.g., software vendor)  General Comments  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 59 B.2 Incident Handler Data Elements  Current Status of the Incident Response  Summary of the Incident  Incident Handling Actions – Log of actions taken by all handlers – Contact information for all involved parties – List of evidence gathered  Incident Handler Comments  Cause of the Incident (e.g., misconfigured application, unpatched host)  Cost of the Incident  Business Impact of the Incident49                                                          49  The business impact of the incident could either be a description of the incident’s effect (e.g., accounting department unable to perform tasks for two days) or an impact category based on the cost (e.g., a “major” incident has a cost of over $100,000). COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 60 Appendix C—Glossary Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

The following are frequently asked questions (FAQ). Organizations are encouraged to customize this FAQ and make it available to their user community. 1. What is an incident? In general, an incident is a violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard computer security practices. Examples of incidents are:  An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to one of an organization’s web servers, causing it to crash.  Users are tricked into opening a “quarterly report” sent via email that is actually malware; running the tool has infected their computers and established connections with an external host.  A perpetrator obtains unauthorized access to sensitive data and threatens to release the details to the press if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money.  A user provides illegal copies of software to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services. 2. What is incident handling? Incident handling is the process of detecting and analyzing incidents and limiting the incident’s effect. For example, if an attacker breaks into a system through the Internet, the incident handling process should detect the security breach. Incident handlers will then analyze the data and determine how serious the attack is. The incident will be prioritized, and the incident handlers will take action to ensure that the progress of the incident is halted and that the affected systems return to normal operation as soon as possible. 3. What is incident response? The terms “incident handling” and “incident response” are synonymous in this document.50 4. What is an incident response team? An incident response team (also known as a Computer Security Incident Response Team [CSIRT]) is responsible for providing incident response services to part or all of an organization. The team receives information on possible incidents, investigates them, and takes action to ensure that the damage caused by the incidents is minimized. 5. What services does the incident response team provide? The particular services that incident response teams offer vary widely among organizations. Besides performing incident handling, most teams also assume responsibility for intrusion detection system monitoring and management. A team may also distribute advisories regarding new threats, and educate users and IT staff on their roles in incident prevention and handling.  6. To whom should incidents be reported? Organizations should establish clear points of contact (POC) for reporting incidents internally. Some organizations will structure their incident response capability so that all incidents are reported directly to the incident response team, whereas others will use existing support                                                       50  Definitions of “incident handling” and “incident response” vary widely. For example, CERT®/CC uses “incident handling” to refer to the overall process of incident detection, reporting, analysis, and response, whereas “incident response” refers specifically to incident containment, recovery, and notification of others. See http://www.cert.org/csirts/csirt_faq.html for more information. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 66 structures, such as the IT help desk, for an initial POC. The organization should recognize that external parties, such as other incident response teams, would report some incidents. Federal agencies are required under the law to report all incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). All organizations are encouraged to report incidents to their appropriate Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). If an organization does not have its own CSIRT to contact, it can report incidents to other organizations, including Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). 7. How are incidents reported? Most organizations have multiple methods for reporting an incident. Different reporting methods may be preferable as a result of variations in the skills of the person reporting the activity, the urgency of the incident, and the sensitivity of the incident. A phone number should be established to report emergencies. An email address may be provided for informal incident reporting, whereas a web-based form may be useful in formal incident reporting. Sensitive information can be provided to the team by using a public key published by the team to encrypt the material. 8. What information should be provided when reporting an incident? The more precise the information is, the better. For example, if a workstation appears to have been infected by malware, the incident report should include as much of the following data as practical:  The user’s name, user ID, and contact information (e.g., phone number, email address)  The workstation’s location, model number, serial number, hostname, and IP address  The date and time that the incident occurred  A step-by-step explanation of what happened, including what was done to the workstation after the infection was discovered. This explanation should be detailed, including the exact wording of messages, such as those displayed by the malware or by antivirus software alerts. 9. How quickly does the incident response team respond to an incident report? The response time depends on several factors, such as the type of incident, the criticality of the resources and data that are affected, the severity of the incident, existing Service Level Agreements (SLA) for affected resources, the time and day of the week, and other incidents that the team is handling. Generally, the highest priority is handling incidents that are likely to cause the most damage to the organization or to other organizations. 10. When should a person involved with an incident contact law enforcement? Communications with law enforcement agencies should be initiated by the incident response team members, the chief information officer (CIO), or other designated official—users, system administrators, system owners, and other involved parties should not initiate contact.  11. What should someone do who discovers that a system has been attacked? The person should immediately stop using the system and contact the incident response team. The person may need to assist in the initial handling of the incident—for instance, physically monitoring the system until incident handlers arrive to protect evidence on the system. 12. What should someone do who is contacted by the media regarding an incident? A person may answer the media’s questions in accordance with the organization’s policy regarding incidents and outside parties. If the person is not qualified to represent the organization in terms of discussing the incident, the person should make no comment regarding the incident, COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 67 other than to refer the caller to the organization’s public affairs office. This will allow the public affairs office to provide accurate and consistent information to the media and the public. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 68 Appendix G—Crisis Handling Steps This is a list of the major steps that should be performed when a technical professional believes that a serious incident has occurred and the organization does not have an incident response capability available. This serves as a basic reference of what to do for someone who is faced with a crisis and does not have time to read through this entire document. 1. Document everything. This effort includes every action that is performed, every piece of evidence, and every conversation with users, system owners, and others regarding the incident. 2. Find a coworker who can provide assistance. Handling the incident will be much easier if two or more people work together. For example, one person can perform actions while the other documents them. 3. Analyze the evidence to confirm that an incident has occurred. Perform additional research as necessary (e.g., Internet search engines, software documentation) to better understand the evidence. Reach out to other technical professionals within the organization for additional help. 4. Notify the appropriate people within the organization. This should include the chief information officer (CIO), the head of information security, and the local security manager. Use discretion when discussing details of an incident with others; tell only the people who need to know and use communication mechanisms that are reasonably secure. (If the attacker has compromised email services, do not send emails about the incident.) 5. Notify US-CERT and/or other external organizations for assistance in dealing with the incident.  6. Stop the incident if it is still in progress. The most common way to do this is to disconnect affected systems from the network. In some cases, firewall and router configurations may need to be modified to stop network traffic that is part of an incident, such as a denial of service (DoS) attack. 7. Preserve evidence from the incident. Make backups (preferably disk image backups, not file system backups) of affected systems. Make copies of log files that contain evidence related to the incident. 8. Wipe out all effects of the incident. This effort includes malware infections, inappropriate materials (e.g., pirated software), Trojan horse files, and any other changes made to systems by incidents. If a system has been fully compromised, rebuild it from scratch or restore it from a known good backup. 9. Identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited. The incident may have occurred by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications. It is critical to identify such vulnerabilities and eliminate or otherwise mitigate them so that the incident does not recur. 10. Confirm that operations have been restored to normal. Make sure that data, applications, and other services affected by the incident have been returned to normal operations. 11. Create a final report. This report should detail the incident handling process. It also should provide an executive summary of what happened and how a formal incident response capability would have helped to handle the situation, mitigate the risk, and limit the damage more quickly.   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 69 Appendix H—Change Log Revision 2 Draft 1—January 2012 Editorial:  Tightened writing throughout publication  Made minor formatting changes throughout publication Technical Changes:  Expanded material on information sharing (throughout Section 2)  Updated incident reporting organization listings (Section 2.3.4.3)  Updated list of common incident response team services (Section 2.5)  Revised the incident response life cycle diagrams (throughout Section 3)  Revamped the list of attack vectors (Section 3.2.1)  Revamped the factors for incident handling prioritization (Section 3.2.6)  Changed focus from identifying the attacker to identifying the attacking host (Section 3.3.3)  Expanded the list of possible incident metrics (Section 3.4.2)  Updated the incident handling scenarios to reflect current threats (old Appendix B, new Appendix A)  Made minor updates to incident-related data field suggestions (old Appendix C, new Appendix B)  Updated all of the tools and resources listings (old Appendix G, new Appendix E)  Updated the Frequently Asked Questions and the Crisis Handling Steps to reflect changes made elsewhere in the publication (old Appendices H and I, new Appendices F and G) Deletions:  Removed duplicate material on forensics, pointed readers to SP 800-86 for the same information (Section 3.3.2)  Deleted material specific to the old incident categories (Sections 4 through 8)  Deleted the duplicate list of recommendations (old Appendix A)  Deleted print resources list (old Appendix F)  Deleted federal agency incident reporting categories (old Appendix J)  Revision 2 Final—August 2012 Editorial:  Made minor revisions throughout publication Technical Changes:  Added information sharing as a team service (Section 2.5)  Converted Table 3-1 into bulleted lists (Section 3.1.1)  Added a mention of exercises (Section 3.1.1)  Revised the attack vectors (formerly incident categories) (Section 3.2.1) COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE 70  Added SIEMs, network flows as common sources of precursors and indicators (Section 3.2.3)  Expanded discussion of eradication and recovery (Section 3.3.4)  Added a section on coordination and information sharing (Section 4)  Added a table of data exchange specifications applicable to incident handling (Appendix E)  Association for the Advancementof Medical InstrumentationANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010Application of risk management for IT Networks incorporating medical devices — Part 1: Roles, responsibilities and activitiesAAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Objectives and uses of AAMI standards and recommended practices   It is most important that the objectives and potential uses of an AAMI product standard or recommended practice are clearly understood. The objectives of AAMI's technical development program derive from AAMI's overall mission: the advancement of medical instrumentation. Essential to such advancement are (1) a continued increase in the safe and effective application of current technologies to patient care, and (2) the encouragement of new technologies. It is AAMI's view that standards and recommended practices can contribute significantly to the advancement of medical instrumentation, provided that they are drafted with attention to these objectives and provided that arbitrary and restrictive uses are avoided. A voluntary standard for a medical device recommends to the manufacturer the information that should be provided with or on the product, basic safety and performance criteria that should be considered in qualifying the device for clinical use, and the measurement techniques that can be used to determine whether the device conforms with the safety and performance criteria and/or to compare the performance characteristics of different products. Some standards emphasize the information that should be provided with the device, including performance characteristics, instructions for use, warnings and precautions, and other data considered important in ensuring the safe and effective use of the device in the clinical environment. Recommending the disclosure of performance characteristics often necessitates the development of specialized test methods to facilitate uniformity in reporting; reaching consensus on these tests can represent a considerable part of committee work. When a drafting committee determines that clinical concerns warrant the establishment of minimum safety and performance criteria, referee tests must be provided and the reasons for establishing the criteria must be documented in the rationale.  A recommended practice provides guidelines for the use, care, and/or processing of a medical device or system. A recommended practice does not address device performance per se, but rather procedures and practices that will help ensure that a device is used safely and effectively and that its performance will be maintained. Although a device standard is primarily directed to the manufacturer, it may also be of value to the potential purchaser or user of the device as a frame of reference for device evaluation. Similarly, even though a recommended practice is usually oriented towards healthcare professionals, it may be useful to the manufacturer in better understanding the environment in which a medical device will be used. Also, some recommended practices, while not addressing device performance criteria, provide guidelines to industrial personnel on such subjects as sterilization processing, methods of collecting data to establish safety and efficacy, human engineering, and other processing or evaluation techniques; such guidelines may be useful to health care professionals in understanding industrial practices. In determining whether an AAMI standard or recommended practice is relevant to the specific needs of a potential user of the document, several important concepts must be recognized: All AAMI standards and recommended practices are voluntary (unless, of course, they are adopted by government regulatory or procurement authorities). The application of a standard or recommended practice is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Each AAMI standard or recommended practice reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care professionals and industrial representatives, whose work has been reviewed nationally (and sometimes internationally). As such, the consensus recommendations embodied in a standard or recommended practice are intended to respond to clinical needs and, ultimately, to help ensure patient safety. A standard or recommended practice is limited, however, in the sense that it responds generally to perceived risks and conditions that may not always be relevant to specific situations. A standard or recommended practice is an important reference in responsible decision-making, but it should never replace responsible decision-making. Despite periodic review and revision (at least once every five years), a standard or recommended practice is necessarily a static document applied to a dynamic technology. Therefore, a standards user must carefully review the reasons why the document was initially developed and the specific rationale for each of its provisions. This review will reveal whether the document remains relevant to the specific needs of the user. Particular care should be taken in applying a product standard to existing devices and equipment, and in applying a recommended practice to current procedures and practices. While observed or potential risks with existing equipment typically form the basis for the safety and performance criteria defined in a standard, professional judgment must be used in applying these criteria to existing equipment. No single source of information will serve to identify a particular product as "unsafe". A voluntary standard can be used as one resource, but the ultimate decision as to product safety and efficacy must take into account the specifics of its utilization and, of course, cost-benefit considerations. Similarly, a recommended practice should be analyzed in the context of the specific needs and resources of the individual institution or firm. Again, the rationale accompanying each AAMI standard and recommended practice is an excellent guide to the reasoning and data underlying its provision. In summary, a standard or recommended practice is truly useful only when it is used in conjunction with other sources of information and policy guidance and in the context of professional experience and judgment.  INTERPRETATIONS OF AAMI STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES  Requests for interpretations of AAMI standards and recommended practices must be made in writing, to the AAMI Vice President, Standards Policy and Programs. An official interpretation must be approved by letter ballot of the originating committee and subsequently reviewed and approved by the AAMI Standards Board. The interpretation will become official and representation of the Association only upon exhaustion of any appeals and upon publication of notice of interpretation in the "Standards Monitor" section of the AAMI News.

For each International Standard that has been adopted by AAMI (and ANSI), the table below gives the corresponding U.S. designation and level of equivalency to the International Standard. NOTE: Documents are sorted by international designation. The code in the US column, “(R)20xx” indicates the year the document was officially reaffirmed by AAMI. E.g., ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-4:2002/(R)2009 indicates that 10993-4, originally approved and published in 2002, was reaffirmed without change in 2009. Other normatively referenced International Standards may be under consideration for U.S. adoption by AAMI; therefore, this list should not be considered exhaustive.

The United States is one of the IEC members that took an active role in the development of this standard.  International standard IEC 80001-1:2010 was developed jointly by Sub-Committee IEC/SC 62A, Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice and ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, to define the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security.  U.S. participation in this IEC SC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A administered by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. AAMI administers the International Secretariat for IEC/SC 62A on behalf of the United States, and U.S. experts made a considerable contribution to this International Standard.  AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with International Standards in the area of risk management of information technology as it relates to medical devices. The AAMI Information Technology Networks Incorporating Medical Devices (IT) Committee together with the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, reviewed IEC 80001-1 to formulate the U.S. position and comments while the document was being developed. This close collaboration helped gain widespread U.S. consensus on the document. As the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for IEC/SC 62A, AdvaMed granted AAMI permission to consider adoption of IEC 80001-1 as a new American national Standard. Following AAMI procedures, the AAMI IT Committee voted to adopt the IEC international standard as written.  AAMI and ANSI procedures require that standards be reviewed every five years and, if necessary, revised to reflect technological advances that may have occurred since publication.  AAMI (and ANSI) have adopted other IEC and ISO standards. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of IEC and ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the IEC and ISO standard.  The concepts incorporated in this standard should not be considered inflexible or static. This standard, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new data comes to light.  Suggestions for improving this standard are invited. Comments and suggested revisions should be sent to Standards Department, AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Dr. Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633.  NOTE—Beginning with the foreword on page ix, this American National Standard is identical to IEC 80001-1:2010.    viii  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION ____________  APPLICATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR IT-NETWORKS  INCORPORATING MEDICAL DEVICES –   Part 1: Roles, responsibilities and activities   FOREWORD 1) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication.

Such information is frequently exchanged through an information technology network (IT-NETWORK) that also transfers data of a more general nature. At the same time, IT-NETWORKS are becoming increasingly vital to the clinical environment and are now required to carry increasingly diverse traffic, ranging from life-critical patient data requiring immediate delivery and response, to general corporate operations data and to email containing potential malicious content (e.g. viruses). For many jurisdictions, design and production of MEDICAL DEVICES is subject to regulation, and to standards recognized by the regulators. Traditionally, regulators direct their attention to MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers, by requiring design features and by requiring a documented PROCESS for design and manufacturing. MEDICAL DEVICES cannot be placed on the market in these jurisdictions without evidence that those requirements have been met. The use of the MEDICAL DEVICES by clinical staff is also subject to regulation. Members of clinical staff have to be appropriately trained and qualified, and are increasingly subject to defined PROCESSES designed to protect patients from unacceptable RISK. In contrast, the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS in the clinical environment is a less regulated area. IEC 60601-1:2005 [1]1) requires MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers to include some information in ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS if the MEDICAL DEVICE is intended to be connected to an IT-NETWORK. Standards are also in place covering common information technology activities including planning, design and maintenance of IT-NETWORKS, for instance ISO 20000-1:2005 [9]. However, until the publication of this standard, no standard addressed how MEDICAL DEVICES can be connected to IT-NETWORKS, including general-purpose IT-NETWORKS, to achieve INTEROPERABILITY without compromising the organization and delivery of health care in terms of SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, and DATA AND SYSTEM SECURITY. There remain a number of potential problems associated with the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS, including: – lack of consideration for RISK from use of IT-NETWORKS during evaluation of clinical RISK; – lack of support from manufacturers of MEDICAL DEVICES for the incorporation of their products into IT-NETWORKS, (e.g. the unavailability or inadequacy of information provided by the manufacturer to the OPERATOR of the IT-NETWORK); – incorrect operation or degraded performance (e.g. incompatibility or improper configuration) resulting from combining MEDICAL DEVICES and other equipment on the same IT-NETWORK; – incorrect operation resulting from combining MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE and other software applications (e.g. open email systems or computer games) in the same IT-NETWORK; – lack of security controls on many MEDICAL DEVICES; and – the conflict between the need for strict change control of MEDICAL DEVICES and the need for rapid response to the threat of cyberattack. When these problems manifest themselves, unintended consequences frequently follow. ————————— 1) Numbers in square brackets refer to the Bibliography.  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  xi AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016This standard is addressed to RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS, to manufacturers of MEDICAL DEVICES, and to providers of other information technology. This standard adopts the following principles as a basis for its normative and informative sections: – The incorporation or removal of a MEDICAL DEVICE or other components in an IT-NETWORK is a task which requires design of the action; this might be out of the control of the manufacturer of the MEDICAL DEVICE. – RISK MANAGEMENT should be used before the incorporation of a MEDICAL DEVICE into an IT-NETWORK takes place, and for any changes during the entire life cycle of the resulting MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, to avoid unacceptable RISKS, including possible RISK to patients, resulting from the incorporation of the MEDICAL DEVICE into the IT-NETWORK. Many things are part of a RISK decision, such as liability, cost, or impact on mission. These should be considered in determining acceptable RISK in addition to the requirements described in this standard. – Aspects of removal, maintenance, change or modification of equipment, items or components should be addressed adequately in addition to the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES. – The manufacturer of the MEDICAL DEVICE is responsible for RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL DEVICE during the design, implementation, and manufacturing of the MEDICAL DEVICE. This standard does not cover the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS for the MEDICAL DEVICE. – The manufacturer of a MEDICAL DEVICE intended to be incorporated into an IT-NETWORK might need to provide information about the MEDICAL DEVICE that is necessary to allow the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to manage RISK according to this standard. This information can include, as part of the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS, instructions specifically addressed to the person who incorporates a MEDICAL DEVICE into an IT-NETWORK. – Such ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS should convey instructions about how to incorporate the MEDICAL DEVICE into the IT-NETWORK, how the MEDICAL DEVICE transfers information over the IT-NETWORK, and the minimum IT-NETWORK characteristics necessary to enable the INTENDED USE of the MEDICAL DEVICE when it is incorporated into the IT-NETWORK. The ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS should warn of possible hazardous situations associated with failure or disruptions of the IT-NETWORK, and the misuse of the IT-NETWORK connection or of the information that is transferred over the IT-NETWORK. – RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS can establish roles and responsibilities among those engaged in the incorporation of a MEDICAL DEVICE into an IT-NETWORK, all aspects of the life cycle of the resulting MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and all activities that form part of that life cycle. – The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is required to appoint people to certain roles defined in this standard. This standard defines the responsibilities of those roles. The most important of those roles is the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER. This role can be assigned to someone within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION or to an external contractor. – The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER is responsible for ensuring that RISK MANAGEMENT is included during the PROCESSES of: • planning and design of new incorporations of MEDICAL DEVICES or changes to such incorporations; • putting the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK into use and the consequent use of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK; and • CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT and change management of the IT-NETWORK during the IT-NETWORK’S entire life cycle. xii  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016– RISK MANAGEMENT should be applied to address the following KEY PROPERTIES appropriate for the IT-NETWORK incorporating a MEDICAL DEVICE: • SAFETY (freedom from unacceptable RISK of physical injury or damage to the health of people or damage to property or the environment); • EFFECTIVENESS (ability to produce the intended result for the patient and the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION); and • DATA AND SYSTEM SECURITY (an operational state of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK in which information assets (data and systems) are reasonably protected from degradation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability). © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  xiii AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016xiv  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016American National Standard ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 APPLICATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR IT-NETWORKS  INCORPORATING MEDICAL DEVICES –   Part 1: Roles, responsibilities and activities    1 Scope  Recognizing that MEDICAL DEVICES are incorporated into IT-NETWORKS to achieve desirable benefits (for example, INTEROPERABILITY), this international standard defines the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for RISK MANAGEMENT of IT-NETWORKS incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES to address SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS and DATA AND SYSTEM SECURITY (the KEY PROPERTIES). This international standard does not specify acceptable RISK levels. NOTE 1 The RISK MANAGEMENT activities described in this standard are derived from those in ISO 14971 [4]. The relationship between ISO 14971 and this standard is described in Annex A. This standard applies after a MEDICAL DEVICE has been acquired by a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION and is a candidate for incorporation into an IT-NETWORK. NOTE 2 This standard does not cover pre-market RISK MANAGEMENT. This standard applies throughout the life cycle of IT-NETWORKS incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES. NOTE 3 The life cycle management activities described in this standard are very similar to those of ISO/IEC 20000-2 [10]. The relationship between ISO/IEC 20000-2 and this standard is described in Annex D. This standard applies where there is no single MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer assuming responsibility for addressing the KEY PROPERTIES of the IT-NETWORK incorporating a MEDICAL DEVICE. NOTE 4 If a single manufacturer specifies a complete MEDICAL DEVICE that includes a network, the installation or assembly of the MEDICAL DEVICE according to the manufacturer’s ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS is not subject to the provisions of this standard regardless of who installs or assembles the MEDICAL DEVICE. NOTE 5 If a single manufacturer specifies a complete MEDICAL DEVICE that includes a network, additions to that MEDICAL DEVICE or modification of the configuration of that MEDICAL DEVICE, other than as specified by the manufacturer, is subject to the provisions of this standard. This standard applies to RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS, MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers and providers of other information technology for the purpose of RISK MANAGEMENT of an IT-NETWORK incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES as specified by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. This standard does not apply to personal use applications where the patient, OPERATOR and RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION are one and the same person. NOTE 6 In cases where a MEDICAL DEVICE is used at home under the supervision or instruction of the provider, that provider is deemed to be the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. Personal use where the patient acquires and uses a MEDICAL DEVICE without the supervision or instruction of a provider is out of scope of this standard. This standard does not address regulatory or legal requirements. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  1 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/20162 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply: 2.1  ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT a document accompanying a MEDICAL DEVICE or an accessory and containing information for the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION or OPERATOR, particularly regarding SAFETY NOTE Adapted from IEC 60601-1:2005, definition 3.4. 2.2  CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESS that ensures that all changes to the IT-NETWORK are assessed, approved, implemented and reviewed in a controlled manner and that changes are delivered, distributed, and tracked, leading to release of the change in a controlled manner with appropriate input and output with CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT NOTE Adapted from ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005, Subclauses 9.2 (change management) and 10.1 (release management). 2.3  CHANGE PERMIT an outcome of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS consisting of a document that allows a specified change or type of change without further RISK MANAGEMENT Activities subject to specified constraints 2.4  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT a PROCESS that ensures that configuration information of components and the IT-NETWORK are defined and maintained in an accurate and controlled manner, and provides a mechanism for identifying, controlling and tracking versions of the IT-NETWORK NOTE Adapted from ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005, Subclause 9.1. 2.5  DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY an operational state of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK in which information assets (data and systems) are reasonably protected from degradation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability NOTE 1 Security, when mentioned in this standard, should be taken to include DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY.

NOTE 1 The definition of a device for in vitro examination includes, for example, reagents, calibrators, sample collection and storage devices, control materials, and related instruments or apparatus. The information provided by such an in vitro diagnostic device may be for diagnostic, monitoring or compatibility purposes. In some jurisdictions, some in vitro diagnostic devices, including reagents and the like, may be covered by separate regulations. NOTE 2 Products which may be considered to be medical devices in some jurisdictions but for which there is not yet a harmonized approach, are: – aids for disabled/handicapped people; – devices for the treatment/diagnosis of diseases and injuries in animals; – accessories for medical devices (see Note 3); – disinfection substances; – devices incorporating animal and human tissues which may meet the requirements of the above definition but are subject to different controls. NOTE 3 Accessories intended specifically by manufacturers to be used together with a ‘parent’ medical device to enable that medical device to achieve its intended purpose should be subject to the same GHTF procedures as apply to the medical device itself. For example, an accessory will be classified as though it is a medical device in its own right. This may result in the accessory having a different classification than the ‘parent’ device. NOTE 4 Components to medical devices are generally controlled through the manufacturer’s quality management system and the conformity assessment procedures for the device. In some jurisdictions, components are included in the definition of a ‘medical device’.

The RISK MANAGEMENT policy shall include: a) balancing the three KEY PROPERTIES with the mission of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION; b) a means to establish RISK acceptability criteria for each of the KEY PROPERTIES taking into account relevant international standards and national or regional regulations; and c) a description of or reference to PROCESSES applying to MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS including, at least, 1) EVENT MANAGEMENT, 2) CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT, 3) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT, and 4) monitoring. NOTE MEDICAL IT-NETWORK life cycle activities can be captured in an IT service management policy (e.g. per ISO 20000) provided there is a clear relationship to the RISK MANAGEMENT policy. The policy shall be expressed in terms that can be interpreted throughout all RISK MANAGEMENT activities. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER shall establish and maintain a PROCESS for identifying HAZARDS, estimating and evaluating the associated RISKS, controlling these RISKS, and monitoring the effectiveness of the RISK CONTROLS, taking the defined use of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK into account. NOTE Subsequent changes to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK could introduce new RISKS and require additional analyses. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.3 MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT planning and documentation 4.3.1 Overview The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall plan RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK by providing  a) RISK-relevant asset description, NOTE 1 See 4.3.2 for a description and examples of RISK-relevant assets. b) IT-NETWORK documentation, and  c) a RISK MANAGEMENT plan for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK.  NOTE 2 Assessment and documentation of the structure of the network is essential to provide the necessary information for RISK ANALYSIS and RISK EVALUATION.  14  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Because of the nature of IT-NETWORKS, both the current state of the IT-NETWORK and planned changes shall be considered. Initial development of new MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS as well as changes to existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS not covered by documented CHANGE PERMITS shall be managed by projects. NOTE 3 A MEDICAL IT-NETWORK can have multiple concurrent or sequential projects.  NOTE 4 See also 4.5.2.3 for MEDICAL IT-NETWORK projects and 4.5.2.2 for CHANGE PERMITS. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.3.2 RISK-relevant asset description The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish a list of assets of IT-NETWORKS interfacing with MEDICAL DEVICES. Typical assets include, but are not limited to hardware, software, and data essential to the INTENDED USE of the MEDICAL DEVICE and the defined use of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The asset list may include for example: a) specific components of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and all incorporated MEDICAL DEVICES and other equipment (e.g. image creating modalities, network components) of the IT infrastructure;  b) operational characteristics of the IT infrastructure of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK (e.g. performance properties such as bandwidth); c) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT information; d) medical application software; e) data about configuration of hardware and software; f) characterization of identifiable patient data on the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or used by the incorporated MEDICAL DEVICE including its nature, volume, and sensitivity; g) healthcare procedure support information, including history of use and OPERATOR/user details; and h) a security description and other materials relevant to total system SAFETY considerations (in case security is an aspect of SAFETY). Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.3.3 MEDICAL IT-NETWORK documentation The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish and maintain network documentation necessary to support the RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK for the interfaces between the MEDICAL DEVICE(S) and all network components (both software and hardware). This documentation shall include but not be limited to: a) physical and logical network configuration; NOTE 1 The network configuration includes defining the boundaries of the network. NOTE 2 Documentation can contain IT-NETWORK electrical properties that might impact the performance of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and incorporated devices. Examples include, but are not limited to, grounding, galvanic (de)coupling, stray currents, and power over Ethernet. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  15 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016b) applied standards and conformance statements; c) physical and logical client / server structure; d) network security, reliability and data integrity;  e) network communication requirements for each MEDICAL DEVICE as specified by the manufacturer; and f) future (planned / reasonably foreseeable) changes / upgrades / enhancements. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.3.4 RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT Whenever a MEDICAL DEVICE is incorporated into an IT-NETWORK, or the configuration of such a connection is changed, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall determine the need for one or more documented RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS that define (e.g. by contract) the responsibilities of all relevant stakeholders. A RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT may cover one or more projects or the maintenance of one or more MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS, and shall identify responsibility for all aspects of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK life cycle and all activities that form part of that life cycle. NOTE In order to support incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES into an IT-NETWORK, the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers make available technical information appropriate to the creation of RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION RISK MANAGEMENT documentation. Where the PROCESS requires information that a MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer believes is sensitive in nature, the provision of the information will be determined by the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT and can be protected by a confidentiality agreement. The RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENTS shall contain (or refer to documents which contain) at a minimum: a) the name of the person responsible for RISK MANAGEMENT for the activities covered by the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT; b) the scope of the activities covered by the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT, including a summary of and/or reference to the requirements; c) a list of the MEDICAL DEVICES and other equipment which are to be incorporated into the IT-NETWORK or changed, together with the names of MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers or other organizations responsible for the provision of technical information necessary for the completion of the project; d) a list of documents to be supplied by the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers and other equipment suppliers that contain instructions for connection to or disconnection from an IT-NETWORK; e) technical information to be supplied by the MEDICAL DEVICE or IT manufacturers and other equipment suppliers that is necessary to perform RISK ANALYSIS for the IT-NETWORK; and f) definition of roles and responsibilities in managing potentially adverse events. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall provide a summary of responsibilities as appropriate. NOTE 1 The manufacturer of a MEDICAL DEVICE is responsible for making available technical documentation on how to use the MEDICAL DEVICE’S interfaces to connect to an IT-NETWORK, provided that such a connection is intended by the 16  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016manufacturer. There is no such obligation on the supplier of other equipment, and it might be necessary to make a specific arrangement to gain access to such technical documentation. If the co-operation of manufacturers of MEDICAL DEVICES, suppliers of other equipment or other organizations is necessary in addition to the listed documents supplied by the manufacturers or organizations, a RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT shall: g) identify the nature of the co-operation required; and h) state: ⎯ who is responsible for requesting such co-operation; ⎯ who is responsible for responding to such requests; and ⎯ what criteria will be used to judge the adequacy of such response. NOTE 2 Since this information can change through the lifecycle of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, it is recommended that it be updated periodically in the RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.3.5 RISK MANAGEMENT plan for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish and maintain a RISK MANAGEMENT plan for each MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The RISK MANAGEMENT plan shall include: a) a description of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, including: 1) identified stakeholders within the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION that shall be informed about HAZARDS to ensure their RISK awareness; 2) the defined use and expected benefits of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK; 3) the reason for each MEDICAL DEVICE incorporation; and  4) the use of each MEDICAL DEVICE, due to its incorporation into the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK that is not included in the manufacturer’s INTENDED USE. b) a description of activities, roles and responsibilities for all parties involved in operating/maintaining the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, with respect to RISK MANAGEMENT. c) requirements for monitoring the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK (refer to 4.6.1). d) criteria for RISK acceptability, based on the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION’S policy for determining acceptable RISK, including criteria for accepting RISKS when the probability of occurrence of HARM cannot be estimated. When a project introduces changes to an existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, the RISK MANAGEMENT plan for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK shall be updated. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4 MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT 4.4.1 Overview This section describes RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES that support both the execution of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK project as well as the decision to go live on any particular change. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  17 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016The RISK MANAGEMENT activities of RISK ANALYSIS, RISK EVALUATION, RISK CONTROL, RESIDUAL RISK evaluation and reporting and approval shall be documented. This documentation may be integral to the RISK MANAGEMENT plan or exist as separate documents in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE associated with the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Action plans arising from RISK ASSESSMENT shall follow the CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESS. NOTE There is a single set of RISK MANAGEMENT documents per MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, because RISK CONTROL measures for any given project or change must not conflict with existing RISK CONTROL measures for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or with RISK CONTROL measures proposed by a concurrent project. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.2 RISK ANALYSIS The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall identify HAZARDS that are likely to arise from the MEDICAL IT–NETWORK. For each identified HAZARD, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall estimate the associated RISKS using available information or data. NOTE RISKS to be analyzed cover the entire life cycle, especially including the implementation of the change and the regular use of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. If the probability of the occurrence of HARM cannot be estimated, the possible consequences shall be listed for use in RISK EVALUATION and RISK CONTROL. The results of these activities shall be recorded in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.3 RISK EVALUATION For each identified HAZARD, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall decide, using the criteria defined in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan, whether: a) the estimated RISK(S) is so low that RISK reduction need not to be pursued. In this case the rationale for this decision shall be documented in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. b) the estimated RISK(S) are not acceptable. In this case RISK CONTROL measures shall be implemented according to 4.4.4. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.4 RISK CONTROL 4.4.4.1 RISK CONTROL option analysis The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall identify and document proposed RISK CONTROL measures for each unacceptable RISK until the RESIDUAL RISK(S) is judged acceptable. One or more RISK CONTROL options shall be used in the priority order listed: a) inherent control by design (e.g. physical isolation of a network from external threats); 18  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016b) protective measures (e.g. including alarms); c) information for assurance (e.g. warnings, user documentation, training). NOTE 1 RISK CONTROL measures can include for example: - instructions and constraints documented as a CHANGE PERMIT (see 2.3 and 4.5.2.2); - network components; - change of network configuration; - organizational considerations; or - changes to the incorporated MEDICAL DEVICES. NOTE 2 For each RISK, the design should carefully consider where to best implement the control to ensure sustainability – for example, by changes to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or manufacturer-authorized changes to the MEDICAL DEVICE. To the extent that RISK CONTROL entails tradeoffs in KEY PROPERTIES, the KEY PROPERTIES shall be considered in priority order of SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, and DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY. If, during RISK CONTROL option analysis, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION determines that required RISK reduction is not practicable, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall conduct and document a RISK/benefit analysis of the RESIDUAL RISK (see 4.4.5). Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.4.2 RISK CONTROL measures When a specific RISK CONTROL measure is selected that requires a change to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES shall be followed. The RISK CONTROL measures selected shall be recorded in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.4.3 Implementation of RISK CONTROL measures The selected RISK CONTROL measures shall be implemented. RISK CONTROL measures within the MEDICAL DEVICE should only be implemented by the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer or by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION following the instructions for use or with the documented permission of the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer. Any changes to a MEDICAL DEVICE undertaken by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION without documented consent of the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer are not recommended. If such a change is undertaken, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall notify the manufacturer and shall follow all necessary regulatory steps for putting such a modified MEDICAL DEVICE into service. Any RESIDUAL RISK shall be documented in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  19 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/20164.4.4.4 VERIFICATION of RISK CONTROL measures  The implementation of all RISK CONTROL measures in the operational system shall be VERIFIED and documented in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. The effectiveness of the RISK CONTROL measures shall be VERIFIED and documented in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. NOTE It might be necessary to verify the effectiveness of RISK CONTROL measures in a test environment prior to implementation in the operational system. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.4.5 New RISKS arising from RISK CONTROL The implemented RISK CONTROL measures and the installed operational system shall be reviewed for new, unacceptable RISKS (i.e. degraded KEY PROPERTIES or other important attributes essential in realizing the defined use of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK). The evaluation shall be documented in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.4.5 RESIDUAL RISK evaluation and reporting Based on a pre-release assessment of the effectiveness of the implemented RISK CONTROL measures, the RESIDUAL RISK shall be evaluated. Both the individual RESIDUAL RISKS and the overall RESIDUAL RISK shall be assessed for acceptability. NOTE See 4.4.3 for RISK EVALUATION. If an individual RESIDUAL RISK or the overall RESIDUAL RISK is not determined to be acceptable, additional RISK CONTROL measures shall be applied. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall define and document a RESIDUAL RISK summary containing a list of all individual RESIDUAL RISKS and the overall RESIDUAL RISK remaining after the RISK CONTROL measures have been implemented (see 4.4.4.3), including the RESIDUAL RISKS associated with a particular MEDICAL IT-NETWORK project, and the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RESIDUAL RISK. If reduction of RESIDUAL RISK to an acceptable level is not practicable, using the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION’S policy for determining acceptable RISK (see 3.3), the person identified by the TOP MANAGEMENT (see 3.3) to review RESIDUAL RISKS (who may be the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER) shall conduct and document a RISK/benefit analysis of the individual or overall RESIDUAL RISK against the health benefit accrued from the incorporation of the MEDICAL DEVICE into the IT-NETWORK, and decide whether to approve the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RESIDUAL RISK. NOTE See ISO 14971 [4] for RISK/benefit analysis.

The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER shall ensure that a CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESS exists for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and that the PROCESS includes RISK MANAGEMENT. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER shall use the results of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS to determine approval and acceptability of changes during the CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESS. NOTE Unintended consequences can occur when two or more projects running in parallel are insufficiently coordinated. A CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS shall be documented and applied to control the versions of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK across all RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES during MEDICAL IT-NETWORK CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.5.2 Decision on how to apply RISK MANAGEMENT 4.5.2.1 Overview For any new MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or a change to an existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, the CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT PROCESS shall be initiated. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall consider the nature of the change to decide whether the requirements are met by an applicable CHANGE PERMIT. Where no applicable CHANGE PERMIT exists, a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK project shall be initiated. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.5.2.2 CHANGE PERMITS  If the RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATION decides, as a result of RISK MANAGEMENT activities, that a specified type of routine change may be performed with acceptable RISK, subject to specified constraints, then the RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATION may define a CHANGE PERMIT which allows such routine changes and specifies the constraints. NOTE 1 For example, a CHANGE PERMIT might allow varying the number of MEDICAL DEVICES of a specified type in a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK within a specified range. NOTE 2 Provided that the changes performed always conform to the CHANGE PERMIT and its limitations, no CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT or RISK MANAGEMENT is needed each time the CHANGE PERMIT is used. A CHANGE PERMIT shall specify what records are to be kept for each permitted change. CHANGE PERMITS shall be maintained in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. NOTE 3 CHANGE PERMITS can only be established as an outcome of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS (see 4.4.4.2). © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  21 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.5.2.3 MEDICAL IT-NETWORK projects The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish and maintain a project plan for the incorporation of a new type of MEDICAL DEVICE into an IT-NETWORK, for change to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, for change to the MEDICAL DEVICES incorporated in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, for decommissioning of a MEDICAL DEVICE or MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, or any other activity that has the potential to introduce new RISK. The typical first project plan would be for development of a new MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The project plan shall provide: a) requirements for RISK MANAGEMENT activities including: 1) activities to establish or update any RISK MANAGEMENT FILE documents needed as a result of this project, such as the RISK MANAGEMENT plan or other RISK MANAGEMENT documents; 2) a plan to meet the requirements stated in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan for the affected MEDICAL IT-NETWORK(S); and 3) activities for VERIFICATION of RISK CONTROL measures. b) a description of the project including: 1) identification of MEDICAL IT-NETWORK(S) developed or affected by the project; 2) requirements specification for the project; and 3) specification of minimum set of documents required for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK project. c) the scope of the planned changes to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, including but not limited to: 1) physical and logical configuration of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK before and after the planned changes; 2) information flow before and after the planned changes; 3) components to be acquired or removed; 4) specifications of non-medical network components where relevant; and 5) constraints on the extendibility of the existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. The project plan shall be revised whenever necessary to reflect changes to the project. The project plan shall be kept in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE in accordance with the life cycle PROCESSES of EVENT MANAGEMENT, CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT, AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT. NOTE Where changes to the IT-NETWORK occur frequently, the project plan may be established as a reusable protocol document containing all these essential elements. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.5.3 Go-live The transition of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK to the “live environment” (Figure 2) is the goal of all project or change initiatives. Before going live, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall review the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RESIDUAL RISK. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER shall examine all project or change RESIDUAL RISK summaries to determine acceptability of RISK associated with interactions with recent or pending 22  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016projects or changes (e.g., the incorporation of the MEDICAL DEVICE into an operational, evolving IT-NETWORK). The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER shall approve the specified change to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK prior to go-live. The approval of the MEDICAL-IT NETWORK RESIDUAL RISK shall be documented and the configuration information recorded in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.6 Live network RISK MANAGEMENT 4.6.1 Monitoring The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish and maintain a PROCESS to monitor each installed MEDICAL IT-NETWORK for emerging RISKS, effectiveness of RISK CONTROL measures, and accuracy of original estimations of RISK. Requirements for monitoring shall be established as part of the RISK MANAGEMENT plan of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Examples of what to monitor are: a) environment changes (including local/connected environment as well as relevant network or component DATA AND SYSTEMS SECURITY vulnerabilities); b) operational/performance feedback e.g., user feedback, speed problems, high error rates, failure, malicious software attacks; c) information about the incorporated components; d) information about similar MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS; e) reported events; and f) auditing of non-technical RISK CONTROL measures such as organizational policies and procedures. If monitoring indicates actual or potential increase in RISK associated with the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or its components (potential or actual negative impact), the EVENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS shall be initiated and significant findings reported to the appropriate party in the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. NOTE In some cases, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION might be required to report observations to regulatory bodies. Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 4.6.2 EVENT MANAGEMENT The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall establish EVENT MANAGEMENT to: a) capture and document negative events; b) evaluate events and propose changes as appropriate through CHANGE-RELEASE MANAGEMENT; c) track all corrective and preventive actions leading to closure; and © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  23 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016d) report significant finds to the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER and/or others in the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION.

Compliance is checked by inspection of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 5.2 MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE In addition to the requirements of other clauses of this standard, the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE shall provide traceability for each identified HAZARD to: a) the RISK ANALYSIS; b) the RISK EVALUATION; c) the implementation and VERIFICATION of the RISK CONTROL measures; and d) the assessment of the acceptability of any RESIDUAL RISK(S) with approval. NOTE 1 The records and other documents that make up the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE can form part of other documents and files. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE need not physically contain all the records and other documents; however, it should contain at least references or pointers to all required documentation. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION should be able to assemble the information referenced in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE in a timely fashion. NOTE 2 The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGEMENT FILE can be in any form or type of medium.

While the responsibility of the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer (often referred to as an “MDM”) for placing a safe and effective MEDICAL DEVICE on the market has not changed, the environment (i.e. the IT-NETWORK) that the MEDICAL DEVICE is placed into is constantly changing. The MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer cannot foresee all the potential changes and has no way of ensuring that the MEDICAL DEVICE will function properly in all possible cases. At the same time, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION (often referred to as a healthcare delivery organization or HDO) has requirements relating to their ability to deliver high quality health care, and security and privacy of patient data that must be achieved under the same constantly changing environment. Achieving these requirements cannot be accomplished without the proper functioning of MEDICAL DEVICES that are part of the environment, i.e. incorporated in their IT-NETWORK. This International Standard recognizes that co-operation is required between those involved in supplying and connecting MEDICAL DEVICES in IT-NETWORKS to achieve all these requirements with today’s rapidly changing technology. It identifies the necessary roles and responsibilities, and a PROCESS for managing the RISK posed by the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES into the information technology infrastructure of the healthcare delivery organization. While the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION takes responsibility for the decisions they make about incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS, these decisions are partly based on claims made and information shared by their suppliers. In some cases the documentation made available when products are placed on the market will be sufficient to support the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION’S decisions. In other cases, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION will need to obtain additional information that might not normally be available. This standard suggests using a RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT to identify what information is needed throughout life of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and the responsibilities for providing and controlling access to that information. In order to maintain evidence of conformance to the requirements of this standard, it is necessary to collect and maintain documentation in a RISK MANAGEMENT FILE for each MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. A.2 Clause 3 – Roles and responsibilities This clause identifies the roles and responsibilities that need to cooperate to manage the RISK of incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS. The healthcare delivery organization that owns and utilizes the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK has overall responsibility for its functioning. It is the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. To ensure that RISK MANAGEMENT is properly addressed for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, the TOP MANAGEMENT of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is required by this standard to establish policy, provide resources, © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  25 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016assign qualified people and review the results of RISK MANAGEMENT activities. It is important that someone be assigned the responsibility for the execution of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. A primary responsibility of TOP MANAGEMENT is appointing a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER and ensuring that others in the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION co-operate with the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER to manage the RISK of incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES into IT-NETWORKS.  Because the concept of RISK depends on the clinical impact of the failure as well as the probability of failure, the responsibilities of the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers are different than those of providers of other information technology. MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers have an understanding of the clinical impact of a network failure which is based on the INTENDED USE of the MEDICAL DEVICE, whereas IT providers can only offer information on failure modes, probabilities, etc., of the IT equipment. For these reasons, these two roles are addressed independently. The MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer is required to have ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS available. These ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS have to be made available to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION as the content of these documents is essential for the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION'S RISK MANAGEMENT activities during incorporating MEDICAL DEVICES into an IT-NETWORK. It is noted that there can be different understandings in the content and the extent of the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. For that reason, the requirements 3.5 a) through 3.5 f) define the minimal content of such ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS as there are MEDICAL DEVICES which are not required to demonstrate compliance with IEC 60601-1 (e.g. IVD medical devices). However, application of subclause 14.13 of IEC 60601-1:2005 [1] to satisfy these requirements for MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers is strongly encouraged. Network failure modes and probabilities also depend on items outside the control of either the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers or the providers of other information technology such as the system design, configuration, topology, IT processes and procedures, actual use (vs. intended) of the MEDICAL DEVICE, etc. Therefore, only the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has ultimate visibility of the RISKS of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and has the primary responsibility for the RISK MANAGEMENT of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. A.3 Clause 4 – Life cycle RISK MANAGEMENT in MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS A basic premise of this standard is that RISK must be considered for all changes before they are made to a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. This standard requires RISK MANAGEMENT to be performed on MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. There can be multiple MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS per RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. The RISK MANAGEMENT activities required in this document are based largely on those of ISO 14971 [4] but go beyond SAFETY as defined in ISO 14971 to include managing RISK to EFFECTIVENESS and RISK to DATA AND SYSTEM SECURITY. This requires some changes to defined terms from ISO 14971. For this standard, HARM is extended to include reduction in EFFECTIVENESS and breach of security. This requires SAFETY to specify what type of HARM is included in the RISK. So the definition of SAFETY becomes freedom from unacceptable RISK of physical injury or damage to the health of people or damage to property or the environment. With these changes, the RISK MANAGEMENT activities of ISO 14971 can be applied for this standard. Because they are being applied to the life cycle management of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK, they are described in the context of an operational MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Clause 4 is divided into sub-clauses that describe the RISK MANAGEMENT activities during the change of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or during the operation of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Table A.1 shows the relationship of the RISK MANAGEMENT activities of ISO 14971 to those in this standard. 26  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Subclause 4.2 – RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION RISK MANAGEMENT Subclause 4.2 describes activities and deliverables that are required at the level of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION.

This includes changing an existing MEDICAL IT-NETWORK as well as initially building a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or turning a non-MEDICAL IT-NETWORK into a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. In this stage, the traditional RISK MANAGEMENT activities © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  27 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016occur in the context of a project. The MEDICAL IT-NETWORK RISK MANAGER is responsible for consolidating all project RISK MANAGEMENT activities into a single RISK MANAGEMENT FILE for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. Some RISK CONTROL measures defined for the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK can include activities during the live environment phase, such as clinical procedures to mitigate network outage. For activities that are performed frequently, it is desirable to avoid unnecessary repetition of RISK MANAGEMENT. This standard mentions CHANGE PERMITS as one way to do this. If RISK MANAGEMENT demonstrates that a routine change, for example adding a user, can be performed with acceptable RISK, subject to specified constraints (for example a limit on the type and number of users), then the RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATION can define a CHANGE PERMIT which allows such routine changes and specifies the constraints. Subclause 4.6 – Live Network RISK MANAGEMENT Subclause 4.6 describes RISK MANAGEMENT activities needed after the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK is put into use (live environment). Monitoring is the ongoing review of all RISK MANAGEMENT activities and RISK CONTROLS that were put in place to achieve acceptable RISK in the use (live environment) of MEDICAL IT-NETWORK(S). It delivers the evidence that overall RISK to KEY PROPERTIES in the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK(S) is acceptable. EVENT MANAGEMENT specifies those actions required when a real or potential negative event occurs during use of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK in the live environment.  28  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016© 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010  29 Annex B  (informative)  Overview of RISK MANAGEMENT relationships  Figure B.1 provides an overview of the various roles and relationships involved in carrying out a RISK MANAGEMENT effort that involves incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES on IT-NETWORKS.

As with general IT-NETWORKS, MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS can be highly complex, highly dynamic systems where monitoring often leads to the need for change. Implementing these changes requires careful preparation. In most cases, because of their regulation under law for quality systems and validation, MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturers are less able to rapidly change their MEDICAL DEVICES. Per regulation, changes and maintenance require strictly formal strategies and procedures that often require the direct involvement of the MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer. For MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS, both the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION and MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer need to recognize these inherently different constraints on service management. In addition, the incorporation of MEDICAL DEVICES can lead to co-dependency of the MEDICAL IT-NETWORK and MEDICAL DEVICES, so that change to one leads to the need for change of the other. Life cycle RISK MANAGEMENT in a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK needs to be done in the context of the specific operating conditions required to support effective healthcare delivery. For this reason, the concepts of IT-service management as described in ISO/IEC 20000-2 [10] have been reviewed for their ability to meet the requirements of IEC 80001-1. This annex provides a simple overview of the relationship between IEC 80001-1 and ISO/IEC 20000-2 to aid in the investigation of service strategies that could address the service needs of a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK. This information also aims to assist in the communication between the parties responsible for IT-NETWORKS and MEDICAL DEVICES (i.e. RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION, MEDICAL DEVICE manufacturer, and providers of other IT technology).  Compliance with ISO/IEC 20000-2 [10] is not equivalent to compliance with IEC 80001-1. D.2 Terminology and definitions Where MEDICAL DEVICES require maintenance, repair or modifications and eventually replacement, IT-NETWORKS have incidents and problems that must be handled and (major) changes that require careful implementation. There are many similarities in the service to both MEDICAL DEVICE(S) and IT-NETWORK(S). For reference, Figure D.1, taken from ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005 [10] indicates the relationship between service processes for IT-NETWORKS. 32  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Service level management   Service reporting Capacity management   Service continuity and availability management Information security management  Budgeting and accounting for IT services   Release processes   Release management   Resolution processes   Incident management  Problem management   Relationship processes   Business relationship management  Supplier management Control ProcessesConfiguration Management Change Management Service delivery processes IEC   239110  Figure D.1 – Service management processes (ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005, Figure 1) Table D.1 relates terminology and sections of IEC 80001-1 to those in ISO/IEC 20000-1 and ISO/IEC 20000-2.

IEC:2009(E) INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION ____________  MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE –   Part 1: Guidance on the application of ISO 14971  to medical device software   FOREWORD 1) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations. 2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.  3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user. 4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter. 5) IEC provides no marking procedure to indicate its approval and cannot be rendered responsible for any equipment declared to be in conformity with an IEC Publication. 6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.  8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The main task of IEC technical committees is to prepare International Standards. However, a technical committee may propose the publication of a technical report when it has collected data of a different kind from that which is normally published as an International Standard, for example "state of the art". IEC 80002-1, which is a technical report, has been prepared by a joint working group of subcommittee 62A: Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, of IEC technical committee 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice, and ISO technical committee 210: Quality management and corresponding general aspects for MEDICAL DEVICES.

Establishing the SAFETY and effectiveness of a MEDICAL DEVICE containing software requires knowledge of what the software is intended to do and demonstration that the implementation of the software fulfils those intentions without causing any unacceptable RISKS. It is important to understand that software is not itself a HAZARD, but software may contribute to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Software should always be considered in a SYSTEM perspective and software RISK MANAGEMENT cannot be performed in isolation from the SYSTEM. Complex software designs can permit complex sequences of events which may contribute to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Much of the TASK of software RISK MANAGEMENT consists of identifying those sequences of events that can lead to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION and identifying points in the sequences of events at which the sequence can be interrupted, preventing HARM or reducing its probability. Software sequences of events which contribute to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS may fall into two categories: a) sequences of events representing unforeseen software responses to inputs (errors in specification of the software); b) sequences of events arising from incorrect coding (errors in implementation of the software). These categories are specific to software, arising from the difficulty of correctly specifying and implementing a complex SYSTEM and the difficulty of completely verifying a complex SYSTEM. Since it is very difficult to estimate the probability of software ANOMALIES that could contribute to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS, and since software does not fail randomly in use due to wear and tear, the focus of software aspects of RISK ANALYSIS should be on identification of potential software functionality and ANOMALIES that could result in HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS – not on estimating probability. RISKS arising from software ANOMALIES need most often to be evaluated on the SEVERITY of the HARM alone. RISK MANAGEMENT is always a challenge and becomes even more challenging when software is involved. The following clauses contain additional details regarding the specifics of software and provide guidance for understanding ISO 14971:2007 in a software perspective. • Organization of the technical report This technical report is organized to follow the structure of ISO 14971:2007 and guidance is provided for each RISK MANAGEMENT activity in relation to software.   There is some intentional REDUNDANCY in the information provided due to the iterative nature of RISK MANAGEMENT activities in the software LIFE-CYCLE.

It does not add to, or otherwise change, the requirements of ISO 14971:2007 or IEC 62304:2006. This technical report is aimed at RISK MANAGEMENT practitioners who need to perform RISK MANAGEMENT when software is included in the MEDICAL DEVICE/SYSTEM, and at software engineers who need to understand how to fulfil the requirements for RISK MANAGEMENT addressed in ISO 14971. ISO 14971, recognized worldwide by regulators, is widely acknowledged as the principal standard to use when performing MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT. IEC 62304:2006, makes a normative reference to ISO 14971 requiring its use. The content of these two standards provides the foundation for this technical report. It should be noted that even though ISO 14971 and this technical report focus on MEDICAL DEVICES, this technical report may be used to implement a SAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS for all software in the healthcare environment independent of whether it is classified as a MEDICAL DEVICE. This technical report does not address: – areas already covered by existing or planned standards, e.g. alarms, usability engineering, networking, etc.; – production or quality management system software; or – software development tools. This technical report is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory inspection or certification assessment activities. For the purposes of this technical report, “should” is used to indicate that amongst several possibilities to meet a requirement, one is recommended as being particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required. This term is not to be interpreted as indicating requirements. 1.2 Normative references The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

This PROCESS shall include the following elements:  - RISK ANALYSIS;  - RISK EVALUATION;  - RISK CONTROL;  - production and POST-PRODUCTION information.  Where a documented product realization PROCESS exists, such as that described in Clause 7 of ISO 13485:2003  [1]1, it shall incorporate the appropriate parts of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.

RISK MANAGEMENT should be performed on the SYSTEM comprising the software and its whole hardware environment. Software RISK MANAGEMENT activities should not be conducted in isolation from the SYSTEM. While software aspects of RISK MANAGEMENT can not be effectively performed in isolation from overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT, there are activities that may be best performed by software engineers as an integral part of the software LIFE-CYCLE. There are also elements of software that require more focus and different explanation than that provided in ISO 14971:2007 for overall MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT. It is important to stress that even the software aspects of RISK MANAGEMENT need to focus on the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK in order to be effective.

NOTE 2 For instance all software failures are systematic not random (as many types of hardware failures/breakdowns are) and their probability can not be accurately estimated. Therefore, the way in which the probability component of RISK is applied to software is quite different. See  4.4.3. There are many opportunities for software engineers to contribute to the overall SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE during the early stages of MEDICAL DEVICE design. The role of software in the SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE should be considered before the SYSTEM design is finalised. By participating in the MEDICAL DEVICE design PROCESS, the software engineer can contribute to SAFETY-related decisions concerning software-related RISKS as the design evolves. Such decisions should include but not be limited to: • the provision of adequate hardware resources to support the software; • the partitioning of functions between hardware and software; • the intended use of the whole MEDICAL DEVICE and the intended use of the software user interfaces; • the avoidance of unnecessarily complex software. 3.1.2 Iteration Typical software development LIFE-CYCLES often use iteration. The use of iteration allows: • investigation of the feasibility of different software designs; • development of different SOFTWARE ITEMS at different times;  • staged delivery of different VERSIONS of the software; • correction of errors made during the software development PROCESS. IEC 62304:2006 requires iteration of RISK MANAGEMENT activities and coordination with SYSTEM design activities throughout the software LIFE-CYCLE. For example, during software development, Subclause 5.2.4 of IEC 62304:2006 requires the re-evaluation of the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK ASSESSMENT when software requirements are established. This re-evaluation may cause an update to SYSTEM requirement specifications and the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK ASSESSMENT. RISK EVALUATION should be repeated at all stages from requirements via ARCHITECTURE and design to the implementation of software. ISO 14971 does not prescribe a design and development PROCESS, and it generally only requires RISK MANAGEMENT steps to be done before and after (not during) the implementation of the design (including RISK CONTROL measures). For example, when a RISK CONTROL measure has been implemented, ISO 14971 requires that it be reviewed to ensure that it has not caused any further HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. This should not be interpreted as an instruction to perform this review only after the implementation is complete—it is advantageous to address any further HAZARDS as soon as they become apparent. This implies iteration within the implementation of the RISK CONTROL measure. It is important that all DELIVERABLES are kept consistent at all times.  Iteration is a threat to the consistency of DELIVERABLES. It is therefore important that rigorous configuration management be used to ensure that all effects of a change are identified and all relevant DELIVERABLES are updated after a change. This is particularly important if software is involved, since software can be changed rapidly and an apparently small change can have unexpected side effects. All information related to the software needs to be up to date in order to avoid miscommunication between engineers. Proposals for software changes are examined for side-effects, especially side-effects which affect SAFETY. This may lead to repetition of parts of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.

With a pro-active approach, SAFETY is considered along with other customer needs and captured as early SAFETY requirements. While a reactive approach is sometimes unavoidable (for example when a legacy product is updated), the proactive approach is usually the most effective, quickest and cheapest way to achieve a safe MEDICAL DEVICE. The advantages of a pro-active SAFETY design are: – from the outset the SYSTEM specification not only includes what the MEDICAL DEVICE should do but also identifies the SYSTEM behaviours that should be avoided in order to reduce the RISK; – from the outset a SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE can be planned that can be demonstrated to provide the desired features while avoiding or preventing unsafe states; – as the ARCHITECTURE is elaborated into a full design, RISK CONTROL measures can be developed while avoiding rework; – the choice of SAFETY approaches and RISK CONTROL measures can be made early (for example, inherent SAFETY by design can be maximized and information for SAFETY minimized). 3.1.4 Characteristics of safe SYSTEMS incorporating software Highly desirable characteristics of safe SYSTEMS include:  – the use of simple hardware SAFETY mechanisms to avoid excessive demands on SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS; – the use of only very simple SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS; – the distribution of SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS between a number of independent processors; – sufficient hardware to run all SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE when needed and without contention; – the use of a deterministic design of software timing; – the appropriate handling of failure conditions, for example • warning the user of failures and to allow opportunities for informed intervention; • providing reduced functionality in failure conditions; • shutting down safely when possible in failure conditions; • recovering quickly from failures; – the means of preventing software code from being modified in its execution environment either through self-modification or as the result of data input; – the means of detecting and/or preventing corruption of SAFETY-related data. 3.2 Management responsibilities  Text of ISO 14971:2007 3.2   Management responsibilities   TOP MANAGEMENT shall provide evidence of its commitment to the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS by: - ensuring the provision of adequate resources and - ensuring the assignment of qualified personnel (see 3.3) for RISK MANAGEMENT.

NOTE  The documents can be incorporated within the documents produced by the MANUFACTURER’S quality management system and these documents can be referenced in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the appropriate documents.  Both ISO 14971:2007 and IEC 62304:2006 assume that a quality management system is in place.  The RISK MANAGEMENT requirements for TOP MANAGEMENT are listed in Subclause 3.2 of ISO 14971:2007. NOTE  Subclause 3.1 of ISO 14971:2007 states that RISK MANAGEMENT can be an integral part of a quality management system and Subclause 4.1 of IEC 62304:2006 states that the demonstration of the MANUFACTURER’S ability to consistently meet customer requirements and applicable regulatory requirements can be by the use of a quality management system that complies with ISO 13485 or a quality management system required by national regulation. IEC 62304:2006 also provides guidance on the provisions of Subclause 4.1 in Annex B.4, stating that it is necessary to establish RISK MANAGEMENT as an integral part of a quality management system as an overall framework for the application of appropriate software engineering methods and techniques. TOP MANAGEMENT is responsible for putting in place the necessary organizational structure, adequate resources, accountability, and training (see  3.3) for an effective RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS as well as for the safe design and maintenance of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. A MANUFACTURER may consider outsourcing software development or maintenance PROCESS activities (e.g. design, implementation, testing, or maintenance). In these situations, TOP MANAGEMENT is still fully responsible for ensuring that appropriate RISK MANAGEMENT activities occur for outsourced software development or maintenance PROCESSES activities and also ensuring that RISK CONTROL measures are appropriately applied. When software development is outsourced, MANUFACTURERS should ensure by suitable contractual agreements that they will have sufficient control of the software and its design to ensure the performance of all RISK MANAGEMENT required by ISO 14971, during the whole LIFE-CYCLE of the MEDICAL DEVICE, including the correction of software ANOMALIES after the software has been released. The MANUFACTURER should consider setting performance requirements on suppliers (see Subclause 7.4 of ISO 13485  [1] for supplier control), such as requiring the supplier to demonstrate:  – effective RISK MANAGEMENT by compliance to ISO 14971; – effective software engineering practices by compliance to IEC 62304; – ability to provide MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE that consistently meets customer requirements and applicable regulatory requirements.  If there are RISK CONTROL measures applied to outsourced PROCESSES or products, the RISK CONTROL measures and their importance should be documented and clearly communicated to the supplier within a contractual agreement.

These shall include, where appropriate, knowledge and experience of the particular MEDICAL DEVICE (or similar MEDICAL DEVICES) and its use, the technologies involved or RISK MANAGEMENT techniques. Appropriate qualification RECORDS shall be maintained.  NOTE RISK MANAGEMENT tasks can be performed by representatives of several functions, each contributing their specialist knowledge.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the appropriate RECORDS.  Team members involved in the development and maintenance of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM should have the knowledge and experience appropriate to the TASKS assigned to them. It is fundamental that the person assigned to TASKS with RISK MANAGEMENT implications has the required knowledge of RISK MANAGEMENT. The involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including clinical experts (such as clinical support and technical service experts, and experts on other relevant subjects), software engineers, SYSTEM designers, experts on usability/human factors engineering, and domain experts, and the degree and type of their interaction with the software engineering and test staff should also be considered with respect to RISK MANAGEMENT. This may require the development of a training program for the individuals to ensure full understanding of the required activities. Also, the qualification of the member in the RISK MANAGEMENT team with respect to software should be considered and may require special training. The following subclauses should provide an overview of the field of required knowledge which should be considered. 3.3.2 INTENDED USE/domain knowledge At all stages of the design of a MEDICAL DEVICE, it is important to deploy knowledge of the INTENDED USE. This is particularly important both for designers of software and for staff carrying out RISK MANAGEMENT of software. The complex behaviour of software can easily contribute to misuse or to confusion of the user, leading to previously unforeseen HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. A thorough appreciation of clinical practice will allow RISK managers to identify HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS, and allow software engineers to avoid HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS or to design RISK CONTROL measures. MANUFACTURERS should ensure that clinical experts (such as clinical support and technical service experts, and experts on other relevant subjects) are available to participate in, or at least advise on, both the design activities and the RISK MANAGEMENT activities. In addition, MANUFACTURERS should consider training software engineers and RISK managers in the clinical use of the MEDICAL DEVICE. 3.3.3 Programming experience and attitude Experienced software developers and testers learn to be realistic about the difficulty of discovering all software defects during testing, and hence the density of software defects Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 14 – TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) remaining after testing.  It is important to include experienced staff in the software development team and to give them appropriate authority to mentor, oversee and challenge less experienced staff. It is particularly important to assign experienced staff to the following software TASKS: – identification of the ways in which software can fail; – analysis of RISKS associated with software failure; – identification of RISK CONTROL measures; – analysis of post-release PROBLEM REPORTS; – design and implementation of changes, especially post-release. In all these TASKS, experience will lead to an appreciation of the sort of things that can go wrong with software and with software development PROCESSES, and an awareness of the difficulties of making a change while maintaining the integrity of a software design. 3.4 RISK MANAGEMENT plan 3.4.1 General Text of ISO 14971:2007 3.4   RISK MANAGEMENT plan  RISK MANAGEMENT activities shall be planned. Therefore, for the particular MEDICAL DEVICE being considered, the MANUFACTURER shall establish and document a RISK MANAGEMENT plan in accordance with the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. The RISK MANAGEMENT plan shall be part of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  This plan shall include at least the following:  a)  the scope of the planned RISK MANAGEMENT activities, identifying and describing the MEDICAL DEVICE and the LIFE-CYCLE phases for which each element of the plan is applicable;  b)  assignment of responsibilities and authorities;  c)  requirements for review of RISK MANAGEMENT activities;  d)  criteria for RISK acceptability, based on the MANUFACTURER’S policy for determining acceptable RISK, including criteria for accepting RISKS when the probability of occurrence of HARM cannot be estimated;  e)  VERIFICATION activities;  f)  activities related to collection and review of relevant production and POST-PRODUCTION information.  NOTE 1 Refer to Annex F for guidance on developing a RISK MANAGEMENT plan.  NOTE 2 Not all parts of the plan need to be created at the same time. The plan or parts of it can be developed over time.  NOTE 3 The criteria for RISK acceptability are essential for the ultimate effectiveness of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. For each RISK MANAGEMENT plan the MANUFACTURER should choose appropriate RISK acceptability criteria.  Options could include, among others:  - indicating in a matrix, such as Figures D.4 and D.5, which combinations of probability of HARM and SEVERITY of HARM are acceptable or unacceptable;  - further subdividing the matrix (e.g. negligible, acceptable with RISK minimization) and requiring that RISKS first be made as low as reasonably practicable before determining that they are acceptable (see D.8).

Refer to D.4 for guidance on establishing such criteria.  If the plan changes during the LIFE-CYCLE of the MEDICAL DEVICE, a RECORD of the changes shall be maintained in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  The RISK MANAGEMENT plan should address the fact that software is part of the MEDICAL DEVICE by including: – a description of the MEDICAL DEVICE including what functionality of the MEDICAL DEVICE will be implemented in software; – a statement that software will be developed according to IEC 62304; – a reference to software development aspects unique to software RISK MANAGEMENT (see Note); – the RISK acceptance criteria for software-caused or software-controlled RISKS if they differ from acceptance criteria for other components of the MEDICAL DEVICE. NOTE A reference to the software development plan may be the simplest way to address the inclusion of software development aspects unique to software RISK MANAGEMENT. See also  3.4.2 and  3.4.3 which discuss the relationship between the RISK MANAGEMENT plan and the software development plan and also specific RISK-related topics of the software development plan according to IEC 62304. One reason that RISK acceptance criteria for software-caused or software-controlled RISKS might differ from acceptance criteria for other components is that the probability of HARM cannot be estimated. In this case the RISK acceptance criteria should be based on the SEVERITY of HARM. (See  4.4.3 for a discussion of probability for software caused HARM). If it can be concluded that the HAZARD is of little practical consequence, the RISK can be judged to be acceptable and no RISK CONTROL measures are necessary. However, for significant HAZARDS, that is, HAZARDS which could inflict HARM of high SEVERITY, no level of exposure can be identified that corresponds to a RISK so low that the RISK is acceptable. In this case RISK CONTROL measures need to be implemented. RISK acceptance criteria for RESIDUAL RISK where probability cannot be estimated should take into account the RISK CONTROL measures that have been implemented and the effectiveness of those RISK CONTROL measures in reducing the probability of occurrence of HARM. RISK CONTROL measures should be a combination of all reasonable practicable measures, fulfil applicable standards and regulations, and be state of the art (see Annex D.4 of ISO 14971:2007). When planning the activities related to collection and review of relevant production and POST-PRODUCTION information the following specific aspects for software should be considered: – If SOFTWARE OF UNKNOWN PROVENANCE (SOUP) is used, then actively monitoring and evaluating publicly available ANOMALY lists and information about the SOUP field performance should be planned. Where possible, this should be supported by a contractual agreement with the SOUP supplier at the time of SOUP acquisition. If the users of the MEDICAL DEVICE may (intentionally or not) modify the SOUP of the MEDICAL DEVICE on their own (e.g. SOUP patches or updates), then special care should be taken in monitoring the provision of new SOUP VERSIONS for the market. See also Clause  9 regarding SOUP and POST-PRODUCTION monitoring. – The MANUFACTURER should make it possible for the originator of a complaint to identify and report the software VERSION.

Planning elements may be embodied in any documents to suit the MANUFACTURER’S quality management system, provided that: – the combination of the planning documents satisfy the requirements of both standards in a verifiable manner; – all plans are consistent with each other; – all plans are available for use in a timely manner; – all plans are kept up to date to reflect changing circumstances. 3.4.3 Specific RISK-related topics of the software development plan according  to IEC 62304 The software development plan should ensure that the software development PROCESS, standards, methods, and tools associated with the development of software (described in the software development plan according to Clause 5 of IEC 62304:2006) are effective RISK CONTROL measures (see  6.2.2.6 for a discussion of PROCESS as a RISK CONTROL measure). This may be done by provision of evidence by other organisations, suppliers, and other projects within the organization. If not known, plan for and verify effectiveness within the project. When establishing the MEDICAL DEVICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, aspects unique to software RISK MANAGEMENT should be considered, such as safe coding standards, VERIFICATION methods (e.g. formal proofs, peer reviews, walk-throughs, simulations, etc), and use of syntactic and logic checkers. If such aspects are considered RISK CONTROL measures, then they would also be subject to VERIFICATION (see Table B.2 for examples of verifying RISK CONTROL measures). Software RISK MANAGEMENT activities should be addressed for each stage of MEDICAL DEVICE development in plans, PROCEDURES, and training, as appropriate. 3.5 RISK MANAGEMENT FILE Text of ISO 14971:2007 3.5   RISK MANAGEMENT FILE  For the particular MEDICAL DEVICE being considered, the MANUFACTURER shall establish and maintain a RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. In addition to the requirements of other clauses of this International Standard, the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE shall provide traceability for each identified HAZARD to:  - the RISK ANALYSIS;  - the RISK EVALUATION;  - the implementation and VERIFICATION of the RISK CONTROL measures;  - the assessment of the acceptability of any RESIDUAL RISK(S).  NOTE 1 The RECORDS and other documents that make up the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE can form part of other documents and files required, for example, by a MANUFACTURER’S quality management system. The RISK MANAGEMENT FILE need not physically contain all the RECORDS and other documents; however, it should contain at least references or pointers to all required documentation. The MANUFACTURER should be able to assemble the information referenced in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE in a timely fashion.  NOTE 2 The RISK MANAGEMENT FILE can be in any form or type of medium.

The degree of relevance depends on the differences between the devices and whether these introduce new HAZARDS or significant differences in outputs, characteristics, performance, or results. The extent of use of an existing analysis is also based on a systematic evaluation of the effects the changes have on the development of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.  NOTE 2 Some RISK ANALYSIS techniques are described in Annex G.  NOTE 3 Additional guidance on RISK ANALYSIS techniques for IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL DEVICES is given in Annex H.  NOTE 4 Additional guidance on RISK ANALYSIS techniques for toxicological HAZARDS is given in Annex I.  In addition to the RECORDS required in 4.2 to 4.4, the documentation of the conduct and results of the RISK ANALYSIS shall include at least the following:  a) a description and identification of the MEDICAL DEVICE that was analyzed;  b) identification of the person(s) and organization who carried out the RISK ANALYSIS;  c) scope and date of the RISK ANALYSIS.  NOTE 5 The scope of the RISK ANALYSIS can be very broad (as for the development of a new device with which a MANUFACTURER has little or no experience) or the scope can be limited (as for analyzing the impact of a change to an existing device for which much information already exists in the MANUFACTURER’S files).  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  As described in ISO 14971:2007, RISK ANALYSIS is a term used to encompass three distinct activities; – identification of INTENDED USE, – identification of known or foreseeable HAZARDS (and their causes), and – estimating the RISK of each HAZARD and HAZARDOUS SITUATION. It is essential to recognize that RISK ANALYSIS is performed as an integral part of the entire software development PROCESS—not as one or two discrete events—for it to be effective because HAZARD and failure mode information accrue over the software development LIFE-CYCLE PROCESS and need to be considered at each stage of design. Since it is very difficult to estimate the probability of software ANOMALIES that could contribute to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS, the focus of software aspects of RISK ANALYSIS is on identification of potential software functionality and ANOMALIES that could result in HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS—not on estimating probability. See  4.4.3 for more details on estimating probability. The SEVERITY of the worst case HARM for which software is a contributing factor is a primary input in determining the level of rigour of software development PROCESSES (see Subclause 4.3 of IEC 62304:2006). The information provided in  4.2,  4.3, and  4.4 is intended to help identify software-specific aspects of an effective RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. In addition, software aspects of the RISK ANALYSIS should be identifiable in the resulting documentation and should include both software used to implement RISK CONTROL measures for hardware failures and software causes for HAZARDS and their associated RISK CONTROL measures. 4.2 INTENDED USE and identification of characteristics related to the SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE  4.2.1 General Text of ISO 14971:2007 4.2   INTENDED USE and identification of characteristics related to the SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) – 19 –  For the particular MEDICAL DEVICE being considered, the MANUFACTURER shall document the INTENDED USE and reasonably foreseeable misuse. The MANUFACTURER shall identify and document those qualitative and quantitative characteristics that could affect the SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE and, where appropriate, their defined limits. This documentation shall be maintained in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  NOTE 1 In this context, misuse is intended to mean incorrect or improper use of the MEDICAL DEVICE.  NOTE 2 Annex C contains questions such as those relating to use that can serve as a useful guide in identifying MEDICAL DEVICE characteristics that could have an impact on SAFETY.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  While each MEDICAL DEVICE has an INTENDED USE, the potential for misuse—intentional or otherwise—should also be considered. While this is not a software-specific concern, the use of software may lead to an increased RISK of misuse because: – the MEDICAL DEVICE’s behaviour is more complex and therefore more difficult to master or understand; – the user may become over-reliant on software, not understanding its limitations; – the MEDICAL DEVICE may be configurable, and the user may be unaware of the current configuration. – MEDICAL DEVICES may communicate with MEDICAL and non-MEDICAL DEVICES in a manner that cannot be anticipated in detail by the MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER. The person responsible for producing SYSTEM requirements and the software engineer have a joint responsibility to RECORD in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE the INTENDED USE of the SYSTEM including its software, together with all SYSTEM and software requirements that relate to SAFETY and safe use. The software engineer is specifically responsible for identifying aspects of INTENDED USE that are too subtle to be apparent at the SYSTEM level. 4.2.2 User interface Software makes it possible to design flexible user interfaces, which may affect users’ behaviour, leading to new forms of reasonably foreseeable misuse. Common misuses arise from misunderstanding of an over-complex user interface and over-reliance on software to avoid errors and unsafe states. It is important to anticipate such misuse and to change the design to avoid them as far as possible. This includes implementation of multi-lingual labelling, especially when such labelling is a RISK CONTROL measure. Special care should be taken of: a) different need for memory size for different languages; b) use of different character sets; c) use of characters instead of symbols; d) use of different units which may require additional scaling of numerical results; e) date formatting and numerical punctuation; f) different layout requirements for different languages and/or character sets; g) support of validation. See IEC 62366  [5] for a usability PROCESS complementary to ISO 14971. 4.2.3 MEDICAL DEVICE interconnection The use of software in MEDICAL DEVICES makes possible a range of interconnections and intercommunication between MEDICAL and non-MEDICAL DEVICES. Such connections and communications are likely to give rise to new uses (and misuses) of the SYSTEM comprising Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 20 – TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) the MEDICAL DEVICE and the interconnected devices. While it is easy to foresee that such new uses and misuses may occur, it is not easy for the MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER to identify all such uses and misuses if the interconnections and intercommunication are unrestricted. It is therefore important for MANUFACTURERS to specify a limited set of INTENDED USES for the MEDICAL DEVICE’S communication interfaces and to design the interfaces as far as possible to limit interconnections and communications to those which are safe. For example, the software may check treatment data that is entered using the built-in interface of a MEDICAL DEVICE for consistency and reasonableness based on the identity of the user and patient and the context of the data preparation. If data is prepared elsewhere and imported into the MEDICAL DEVICE using a network connection, it may not be possible to apply the same checks. In such cases, the MANUFACTURER may consider making the software checks available to the network user as a network application, and/or restricting the data import to trusted sources, and writing a comprehensive manual for those responsible for network connections in a clinical environment. IEC 80001-1  [6] covers the integration of MEDICAL DEVICES into IT networks in a clinical environment. In particular, it delineates the responsibilities of the MANUFACTURER and the person who integrates a MEDICAL DEVICE into the IT network. 4.3 Identification of HAZARDS Text of ISO 14971:2007 4.3   Identification of HAZARDS  The MANUFACTURER shall compile documentation on known and foreseeable HAZARDS associated with the MEDICAL DEVICE in both normal and fault conditions. This documentation shall be maintained in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. NOTE  The examples of possible HAZARDS in E.2 and H.2.4 can be used as guidance by the MANUFACTURER to initiate HAZARD identification. Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  The objective of HAZARD identification is to permit the analysis of all foreseeable HAZARDS, and the design and implementation of effective RISK CONTROL measures. Unlike heat, electrical energy or suspended masses, software is not itself a HAZARD (a potential source of HARM); contact with software cannot cause injury. However, software may cause a person to be exposed to a HAZARD, in other words it may contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Software failures (of any kind) often facilitate the transformation of a HAZARD into a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Thus, although software rarely introduces new HAZARDS, it often changes the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. More importantly for the MANUFACTURER, it may shift the responsibility for avoidance of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS from user to the MANUFACTURER.  For example, a scalpel presents an obvious cutting HAZARD. However, the MANUFACTURER traditionally took no responsibility for this HAZARD beyond ergonomic design, as the HAZARD was assumed to be entirely in the control of the surgeon. If the scalpel is part of a remote surgery SYSTEM, the same HAZARD exists, but responsibility for avoiding the cutting HAZARD is now shared by the MANUFACTURER who supplies the software that controls the scalpel.

An important case is the HAZARD of mistreatment due to the mishandling of data. This was always a HAZARD, but when the data was handled on the clinician’s desk, it was not the MANUFACTURER’S responsibility. Many MEDICAL DEVICES now use software to generate, store, manipulate or use data; this makes the HAZARD partly the MANUFACTURER’S responsibility. Software may contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION in several ways, including some of the following (see also  Annex B): – the software may correctly implement an unsafe SYSTEM requirement, leading to behaviour whose hazardous nature is not appreciated until actual HARM occurs; – the software specification may incorrectly implement a SYSTEM requirement, leading to undesired behaviour that is correct according to the software specification; – the software design and implementation may be faulty, leading to behaviour that is contrary to the software specification. Obvious faults might arise from misunderstanding of the software specification, and errors converting the specification into code.  Less obvious faults could arise from unforeseen interactions between SOFTWARE ITEMS and between the software and its infrastructure, including hardware and the operating SYSTEM. In a MEDICAL DEVICE incorporating software, careful and comprehensive HAZARD identification may lead (in later stages of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS) to the following important outcomes: – hardware RISK CONTROL measures that will prevent software from causing HARM;  – the removal of a potentially harmful software function from the software specification; – RISK CONTROL measures that use software to prevent HARM (see Subclause 5.2.3 of IEC 62304:2006); – identification of the parts of the software that must be implemented with low defect density and parts of the software specification which must be targeted for special testing (Subclause 4.3 of IEC 62304:2006); – identification of higher SAFETY class SOFTWARE ITEMS that must be segregated from other SOFTWARE ITEMS (in a lower software SAFETY class) to prevent HARM arising from unexpected side-effects (see Subclauses 4.3 and 5.3.5 of IEC 62304:2006). See further discussion of this in  6.2.2.2.4. To adequately identify HAZARDS, clinical use of the MEDICAL DEVICE must be well understood.  Also, software presents the particular challenge of complexity, including possible complex user interfaces. Therefore, software HAZARD identification cannot be done in isolation. It should be done at the SYSTEM level by a multidisciplinary team including clinical experts (such as clinical support and technical service experts), software engineers, SYSTEM designers, and experts on usability/human factors engineering (see also  3.3). HAZARD identification should consider HARM that could result from the nature of the MEDICAL DEVICE (for example cutting, irradiating or electrocution of the patient) and also additional HAZARDS related to the use of software. The latter could include, for example: – provision of misinformation to a clinician or patient; – misidentification of the patient (in cases where the MEDICAL DEVICE stores patient details or prescriptions); – delay or denial of treatment caused by software ANOMALY. NOTE For many MEDICAL DEVICES delay or denial of treatment is not considered to HARM a patient. Identified HAZARDS should include both HAZARDS related to software that is operating in accordance with its specification and also HAZARDS relating to software ANOMALIES (see also  6.1).

In particular a MEDICAL DEVICE that incorporates software will often handle information.  While this may be justified in terms of benefits to the patient, additional HAZARDS should be considered relating to incorrect, or incorrectly used, information, for example: – incorrect data entry; – user misreading displays; – user misunderstanding or ignoring alarms; – overloading of users with excessive data or excessive number of alarms (see IEC 62366  [5]). 4.4 Estimation of the RISK(S) for each HAZARDOUS SITUATION  4.4.1 General Text of ISO 14971:2007 4.4   Estimation of the RISK(S) for each HAZARDOUS SITUATION  Reasonably foreseeable sequences or combinations of events that can result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION shall be considered and the resulting HAZARDOUS SITUATION(S) shall be recorded.

NOTE 2 Examples of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS are provided in H.2.4.5 and E.4.  NOTE 3 HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS can arise from slips, lapses, and mistakes.  For each identified HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the associated RISK(S) shall be estimated using available information or data. For HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS for which the probability of the occurrence of HARM cannot be estimated, the possible consequences shall be listed for use in RISK EVALUATION and RISK CONTROL. The results of these activities shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Any system used for qualitative or quantitative categorization of probability of occurrence of HARM or SEVERITY of HARM shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  NOTE 4 RISK ESTIMATION incorporates an analysis of the probability of occurrence and the consequences. Depending on the application, only certain elements of the RISK ESTIMATION PROCESS might need to be considered. For example, in some instances it will not be necessary to go beyond an initial HAZARD and consequence analysis. See also D.3.  NOTE 5 RISK ESTIMATION can be quantitative or qualitative. Methods of RISK ESTIMATION, including those resulting from systematic faults, are described in Annex D. Annex H gives information useful for estimating RISKS for in vitro diagnostic MEDICAL DEVICES.  NOTE 6 Information or data for estimating RISKS can be obtained, for example, from:  a) published standards;  b) scientific technical data;  c) field data from similar MEDICAL DEVICES already in use, including published reported incidents;  d) usability tests employing typical users;  e) clinical evidence;  f) results of appropriate investigations;  g) expert opinion;  h) external quality assessment schemes.

The software may be either the initiating cause of the sequence of events leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, or it may be elsewhere in the sequence, as in the case of software intended to detect a hardware malfunction. The software could include a SOUP component or the reuse of a previously developed component. RISK ESTIMATION is based on the probability of HARM and the SEVERITY of HARM from each identified HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Because it is very difficult to estimate the probability of HARM arising from a software ANOMALY (see  4.4.3), the probability of a software ANOMALY occurring must be used with care in estimating the RISK of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION including software ANOMALY in the sequence of events leading to HARM. 4.4.2 Methods of identification A variety of methods can be used to identify potential software roles in HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. These techniques take different approaches and may be useful at different times in the software development. No single one of them is the only correct method. See also Annex G of ISO 14971:2007 for information on some available techniques for RISK ANALYSIS. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a traditional top down method (see IEC 61025  [3]) often used beginning with the MEDICAL DEVICE as a whole. FTA is primarily used to analyze causes of HARM. It postulates that a HARM occurs and uses Boolean logic to identify the events or conditions that must be present for the HARM to occur. The events or conditions are analysed in increasing detail until a point is reached where one or more RISK CONTROL measures can be identified which would prevent the HARM. FTA can be used to identify the SOFTWARE ITEMS involved in a sequence of events that results in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION.  Failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) is a bottom-up approach (see IEC 60812  [2]) that begins with a component or subsystem (for software this is a SOFTWARE ITEM in IEC 62304), and poses the question: If this element failed, what would be the consequences? In view of the difficulty of anticipating which software defects will be present in each SOFTWARE ITEM, the starting point for FMEA would be to list the safety-related requirements of each SOFTWARE ITEM and consider the question: If this requirement is not met, what would be the consequences? This leads to the identification of SOFTWARE ITEMS whose failure could cause HARM, and identification of what types of failure need to be prevented. When identifying sequences or combinations of events that can result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, it is easiest to focus on software directly related to the essential performance of the MEDICAL DEVICE (e.g. an algorithm that calculates glucose levels in blood) and the specific causes for related HAZARDS. It is also important to consider software causes that could result in subtle failure modes and therefore cause one or more MEDICAL DEVICE HAZARDS. Refer to  Annex B for examples of software causes.  NOTE Specific causes are defects in software whose functionality is clearly related to the clinical functionality of the device and lead to one of the device HAZARDS. An example is a defect in an algorithm for calculating a test result. While it is difficult to anticipate exactly what may fail in a SOFTWARE ITEM, it is possible to identify categories of defects, each of which has well-known RISK CONTROL measures.  For example, corruption of data is a class of fault which could be detected and prevented by using a checksum procedure. See  Annex B for examples of software causes with suggested ways of handling them. MANUFACTURERS should maintain their own lists of categories of software defects relevant to their own products.

However, the probability of a software ANOMALY leading to a software failure is very difficult to estimate, because of the random nature of the inputs to each separate copy of the software. No consensus exists for a method of estimating the probability of occurrence of a software failure. When software is present in a sequence of events leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the probability of the software failure occurring cannot be considered in estimating the RISK for the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. In such cases, considering a worse case probability is appropriate, and the probability for the software failure occurring should be set to 1. When it is possible to estimate the probability for the remaining events in the sequence (as it may be if they are not software) that probability may be used for the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring (P1 in Figure 1). If this is not possible, the probability of the HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurring should be set to 1. Estimates of probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION leading to HARM (P2 in Figure 1) generally require clinical knowledge to distinguish between HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS where clinical practice would be likely to prevent HARM, and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS that would be more likely to cause HARM.

Figure 1 – Pictorial representation of the relationship of HAZARD, sequence of events, HAZARDOUS SITUATION and HARM – from ISO 14971:2007 Annex E In many cases, estimating the probability of occurrence of HARM may not be possible, and the RISK should be evaluated on the basis of the SEVERITY of the HARM alone. RISK ESTIMATION in these cases should be focused on the SEVERITY of the HARM resulting from the HAZARDOUS SITUATION.

Consider, for example, memory corruption resulting from a software ANOMALY. A checksum of the memory could detect the failure and reduce the probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. The checksum does not guarantee any possible corruption would be detected. Rather, it would detect the vast majority of such corruption and thus lower the RISK to an acceptable level. Although the probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION cannot be estimated either before or after the checksum is implemented, it can be asserted that the probability of a HAZARDOUS SITUATION after the checksum is in place is lower than it was before implementing the checksum. It is the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER to demonstrate that the RISK CONTROL measure is effective in meeting the acceptability criteria for RESIDUAL RISK that was identified in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan. In summary, software RISK ESTIMATION should focus primarily on SEVERITY and the relative probability of HARM if a failure should occur rather than on attempts to estimate the probability of each possible software failure. NOTE This helps provide distinctions between HAZARDS of the same SEVERITY to allow greater focus on those with higher probability of actual HARM. 4.4.4 SEVERITY The SEVERITY estimate for a software-caused RISK has an impact on the software development PROCESS to be used. According to IEC 62304 the rigour of the PROCESS depends on the SEVERITY of the HARM the software might cause.  Whereas it is open to the MANUFACTURER how SEVERITY levels are defined for the purpose of RISK EVALUATION according to ISO 14971, it is helpful to define these SEVERITY levels such that there is a relationship to the software SAFETY classification of IEC 62304. Otherwise it might be necessary to classify the SEVERITY twice, once for RISK EVALUATION needed for the overall RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and in addition for determining the SAFETY class of the software according to IEC 62304. 5 RISK EVALUATION Text of ISO 14971:2007 5   RISK EVALUATION  For each identified HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the MANUFACTURER shall decide, using the criteria defined in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan, if RISK reduction is required. If RISK reduction is not required, the requirements given in 6.2 to 6.6 do not apply for this HAZARDOUS SITUATION (i.e., proceed to 6.7). The results of this RISK EVALUATION shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  NOTE 1 Guidance for deciding on RISK acceptability is given in D.4.  NOTE 2 Application of relevant standards, as part of the MEDICAL DEVICE design criteria, might constitute RISK CONTROL activities, thus meeting the requirements given in 6.3 to 6.6.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. As described in  4.4.3, it is difficult to estimate the probability of software failures. When this results in the inability to estimate the probability of HARM then RISK should be evaluated on the basis of the SEVERITY of the HARM alone.

The MANUFACTURER shall use one or more of the following RISK CONTROL options in the priority order listed:  a) inherent SAFETY by design;  b) protective measures in the MEDICAL DEVICE itself or in the manufacturing PROCESS;  c) information for SAFETY.  NOTE 1 If implementing option b) or c), MANUFACTURERS can follow a PROCESS where reasonably practicable RISK CONTROL measures are considered and the option providing the appropriate reduction in RISK is chosen before determining whether the RISK is acceptable.  NOTE 2 RISK CONTROL measures can reduce the SEVERITY of the HARM or reduce the probability of occurrence of the HARM, or both.  NOTE 3 Many standards address inherent SAFETY, protective measures, and information for SAFETY for MEDICAL DEVICES. In addition, many other MEDICAL DEVICE standards have integrated elements of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS (e.g. electromagnetic compatibility, usability, biocompatibility). Relevant standards should be applied as part of the RISK CONTROL option analysis.  NOTE 4 For RISKS for which the probability of occurrence of HARM cannot be estimated, see D.3.2.3.  NOTE 5 Guidance on information for SAFETY is provided in Annex J.  The RISK CONTROL measures selected shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  If, during RISK CONTROL option analysis, the MANUFACTURER determines that required RISK reduction is not practicable, the MANUFACTURER shall conduct a RISK/benefit analysis of the RESIDUAL RISK (proceed to 6.5).  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. 6.2.1 Choosing RISK CONTROL options for complex SYSTEMS 6.2.1.1 General In a complex SYSTEM there may be many sequences of events which can lead to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.

It is sufficient to apply RISK CONTROL measures to selected events to reduce the overall probability of HARM to an acceptable level. In the following three subclauses, an overview is given how three types of RISK CONTROL measures can be implemented in software. In addition, it is discussed which events need RISK CONTROL measures at all (see  6.2.1.5). 6.2.1.2 Inherent SAFETY by design Inherent SAFETY by design is generally achieved by removing unsafe features of a MEDICAL DEVICE, or by changing the design to implement a feature in a safer way, i.e. a way that avoids or minimises HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. This often has the effect of simplifying the design, making it easier to implement and easier for the user to operate. This is particularly true of features implemented in software. There is a temptation in software SYSTEMS to include all possible customer desires without discrimination. This may result in an excessive number of ways in which software components can interact, introducing unexpected HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. By applying RISK MANAGEMENT early in the development of the MEDICAL DEVICE and its software, this can be avoided while still satisfying the majority of customers. In most cases, inherent SAFETY by design, applied to software, will involve: – eliminating unnecessary features; – changing the software ARCHITECTURE to avoid sequences of events that lead to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS; – simplifying the user interface to reduce the probability of human errors in use; – specifying software design rules to avoid software ANOMALIES. An example of the latter would include: – using only static memory allocation to avoid software ANOMALIES related to dynamic memory allocation; – using a restricted VERSION of a programming language to avoid structures which are likely to lead to programming errors. 6.2.1.3 Protective measures Protective measures for a MEDICAL DEVICE that uses software can be implemented in either hardware or software. The design of a protective measure should demonstrate that the protective measure is independent of the function to which it is applied. This is relatively easy to achieve if a software protective measure is applied to hardware or vice-versa. In choosing protective measures that are implemented in software and applied to software, it is important to avoid the possibility of multiple failures arising from one cause. If a protective measure detects and/or prevents a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, the MANUFACTURER should demonstrate an adequate segregation between the protective measure and software features that provide essential performance. For example, software which provides treatment for a patient may run on one processor, while the software which implements software protective measures runs on a separate processor. 6.2.1.4 Information for SAFETY The use of software in a MEDICAL DEVICE is likely to lead to more complex behaviour as seen by the user. This is likely to lead to an increased reliance on information for SAFETY, ranging from simple on-screen warnings to complex user manuals and defined training courses.  The size and complexity of such written material can be reduced by attention to good user-interface design (see IEC 62366  [5]).

Many sequences of events can lead to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. It may not be possible or necessary to apply a RISK CONTROL measure to each event in such sequences. It is sufficient to apply RISK CONTROL measures to carefully selected events to reduce the overall probability of HARM to an acceptable level. In deciding which events should be detected, prevented, or made less likely to occur, it is obviously helpful to map out the sequences of events that could lead to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. While a Fault Tree Analysis (see  4.4.2) does not show sequences of events, it can be used to identify such sequences. Correct operation of a RISK CONTROL measure would appear as a FALSE input to an AND gate, leading to the prevention of HARM irrespective of the other inputs to the AND gate. Figure 2 shows part of an FTA diagram, in which an incorrect software output (itself the output of a sequence of events), is prevented from causing injury to a patient by a RISK CONTROL measure which is designed to detect unsafe conditions and prevent the harmful effects of the output (for example by halting an action). The incorrect software output can only cause injury to the patient if the RISK CONTROL measure fails. Note that the sequence of events leading to the incorrect software output does not need to be explored in detail to ensure that it cannot lead to an injury to the patient.  Figure 2 – FTA showing RISK CONTROL measure which prevents  incorrect software outputs from causing HARM Obvious points at which RISK CONTROL measures may be applied include: – inputs to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM as a whole; – outputs from the SOFTWARE SYSTEM as a whole; – internal interfaces between software modules. A RISK CONTROL measure which limits the range of an input to the software can prevent unsafe outputs. Less obviously, it can also reduce the probability of the input leading to HARM due to an ANOMALY in the software, because it reduces the probability that the software will operate in unexpected ways that may not have been tested (see  4.4.3). Limiting the range of an input to the software can be done using a software or hardware RISK CONTROL measure. For example: IEC   1838/09 Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) – 29 – – a software RISK CONTROL measure can check input and reject unsafe or inconsistent values; – a hardware RISK CONTROL measure could consist of a locked room to prevent unauthorised people from inputting data. A RISK CONTROL measure placed at the output of a MEDICAL DEVICE or its software could check that the software’s output values are within a safe range and internally consistent and could prevent HARM if it is not. This could be achieved, for example, by: – a software RISK CONTROL measure that checks the output values and prevents them from departing from a safe range; – a hardware RISK CONTROL measure that limits the energy applied to a patient; – a RISK CONTROL measure consisting of a combination of a warning label and a hard-wired STOP switch. This RISK CONTROL measure assumes that a competent operator is able to detect the HAZARDOUS SITUATION. In addition to RISK CONTROL measures applied at inputs and outputs of the MEDICAL DEVICE or its software, RISK CONTROL measures may also be applied to inputs and outputs of software components. This allows inputs and outputs of smaller parts of the software to be checked, and HARM prevented. It may not be possible to specify a single range for a parameter within which the MEDICAL DEVICE operates safely. However, it may be possible to specify a “safe operating envelope”, in other words a combination of parameters that form a boundary within which the MEDICAL DEVICE operates safely. Software can be used to assess whether the MEDICAL DEVICE is operating inside the safe operating envelope. For example, software could combine the measured temperature of an applied part and the time of exposure to detect the possibility of burning the patient. There are cases when the safe range for the software’s inputs and outputs is known by a clinician but cannot be anticipated in the design of a MEDICAL DEVICE. In such cases, RISK CONTROL measures can be used to ensure that the MEDICAL DEVICE does exactly what is specified by the clinician. A hardware or software RISK CONTROL measure can be used to detect inconsistencies between the software’s outputs and inputs. For example, the clinician may prescribe treatments, using a MEDICAL DEVICE, which vary widely from one patient to the next. A HAZARDOUS SITUATION cannot be detected only by analysing input or output values. A software RISK CONTROL measure can nonetheless be applied that ensures that the outputs of the MEDICAL DEVICE accurately match the inputs (the intended prescription). 6.2.2 RISK CONTROL methods 6.2.2.1 Overview In order to efficiently implement appropriate RISK CONTROL measures for software, an understanding of the product development and software LIFE-CYCLES should be carefully considered. Some types of RISK CONTROL measures are very easy to implement early in design and impossible or very costly to implement later in development. If software is not carefully considered from a RISK MANAGEMENT perspective early in the product development PROCESS, hardware decisions may be made that inadvertently place excessive reliance on proper software operation for the SAFETY of the MEDICAL DEVICE. It can be useful to segregate SOFTWARE ITEMS and assign software SAFETY classes to the SOFTWARE ITEMS to distinguish highly critical SOFTWARE ITEMS (e.g. those that could result in death if they are defective) from SOFTWARE ITEMS  that could not affect SAFETY. See Subclause 4.3 of IEC 62304:2006 for software SAFETY classification.

If this is done, side-effects should be carefully considered and the less critical SOFTWARE ITEMS should be rated the same as any more critical SOFTWARE ITEMS they could affect. It should also be noted that IEC 62304 allows for different methods to be used within an ACTIVITY or TASK (See Subclause 5.1.4 of IEC 62304:2006 which requires that methods be defined). The MANUFACTURER may decide to create a scheme for differentiating SOFTWARE ITEMS which have the software SAFETY classification of Class C. For example, the MANUFACTURER may use a more formal method of VERIFICATION (i.e., code inspection versus code review) for SOFTWARE ITEMS with high complexity. Note that SOFTWARE ITEMS could be classified initially as SAFETY-related and then through certain RISK CONTROL measures or design choices be treated as less critical. Properly performed RISK MANAGEMENT can result in reducing SAFETY-related software to the smallest possible subset through isolation and inherent safe design. Ensuring software SAFETY requires a variety of activities throughout the product development LIFE-CYCLE. Reliability techniques such as formal methods for failure analysis do not comprise complete RISK MANAGEMENT methods. It is also important to recognize that reliability and SAFETY, although often related, are not identical attributes. A LIFE-CYCLE PROCESS that focuses on reliability may not achieve adequate SAFETY. Some specific RISK CONTROL measures are described in more detail and guidance is given on how to address specific causes for RISKS in  6.2.2.2,  6.2.2.3,  6.2.2.4,  6.2.2.5, and  6.2.2.6. 6.2.2.2 RISK CONTROL measures and software architectural design 6.2.2.2.1 Overview Software ARCHITECTURE should describe features of the software used to control RISK by inherently safe design, as well as software mechanisms for protective measures to reduce RISK. 6.2.2.2.2 Inherently safe design by ARCHITECTURE features A HAZARD associated with a software control function might be avoided, for example, by using hardware to implement the function. (Similarly, a HAZARD associated with a hardware function (wear, fatigue) might be avoided by using software.) Sometimes a HAZARD may be completely avoided by a high-level design decision. For example, from a hardware perspective, use of batteries as a power source in place of AC power could eliminate the RISK of electrocution. Similarly a whole class of programming errors that could lead to a HAZARD could be eliminated based on high level design decisions. For example, memory leaks could be avoided by using only static data structures.  A particular problem in SYSTEMS using software is the perception that there is no limit to the extent to which software can share a physical infrastructure. This perception is false. It is a normal rule of SYSTEM design that the SYSTEM should include sufficient resources to perform all necessary TASKS when required. This rule should be applied to software as well as to hardware. If a SOFTWARE ITEM has a role in SAFETY, then RISK ASSESSMENT should address the following questions: – Can the SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEM gain access to its processor when needed? – Can the SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEM be guaranteed enough processor time to complete its TASK before an unsafe state develops into an accident? – Can it be demonstrated that no other SOFTWARE ITEM can corrupt or otherwise interfere with the SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEM?

Development methods should be chosen to make all of the above issues visible to the designer. For example, it is not enough to design a SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEM as a PROCESS which, all being well, will run when the operating system gets around to it. The development method should support deliberate design of scheduling, priority and timing. 6.2.2.2.3 Fault tolerant ARCHITECTURES Many functions of a MEDICAL DEVICE may be required to be available to assure the SAFETY of the patient or user.  Such functions may include clinical functions that cannot be interrupted or delayed, and functions that implement protective RISK CONTROL measures. Fault-tolerant design is a very common approach to improving MEDICAL DEVICE dependability (references for software engineering practitioners include Pullum  [7] and Banatre  [8]). The objective of fault-tolerant design is to ensure that the SAFETY-related functions will continue to operate in the presence of component faults, including software ANOMALIES. Fault tolerant design will usually make use of REDUNDANCY. This may be a simple duplication of a vital component to provide continued operation when one component fails, or it may consist of additional components which detect a failure and switch operation to an alternative mode of operation, possibly with limited functionality. Fault tolerance may be used to continue vital functions in the event of a software failure. In this case, simple REDUNDANCY using multiple copies of the same software will probably be insufficient, as the same defect will be present in each copy of the software. In such cases, DIVERSITY is required. For example, additional software may be used to detect a software error and to perform a recovery program. The additional software should avoid sharing any features with the software that it monitors, thereby eliminating the possibility that one software defect will cause the failure of both. In more critical cases, two or more SOFTWARE ITEMS may perform the same function but they may be independently designed and implemented, starting from a common specification. This is “DIVERSITY programming”. Note, however, that there is a tendency for the same mistakes to be made by different development engineers, which would invalidate the DIVERSITY. Note also that the common specification may contain an incorrect requirement. Finally, some method, such as voting, must be used to ensure that the malfunctioning software is prevented from having any effect. At least 3 diverse SOFTWARE ITEMS would be needed to implement a voting scheme. When using REDUNDANCY, with or without DIVERSITY, to provide fault tolerance, it is important to signal to the user that there is a failure. Otherwise, a fault tolerant MEDICAL DEVICE may appear to operate safely when in fact it is operating with reduced SAFETY. 6.2.2.2.4 Segregation to reduce RISK from software causes It is possible for software defects to lead to errors in unrelated software running on the same hardware. The manufacturer should select methods of segregating SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS from the non-SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS such that non-SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS cannot interfere with the operation of the SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS (see Subclause 5.3.5 of IEC 62304:2006), and should demonstrate that the segregation is effective. This includes demonstrating the appropriate use of resources (physical or time) by the SOFTWARE ITEMS to avoid unintended contention between the items. Effective segregation between SOFTWARE ITEMS must address the following possible ways in which SOFTWARE ITEMS may be subject to unexpected interaction. Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 32 – TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) SOFTWARE ITEMS may interact in unintended ways when they contend for time on shared hardware (for example processors, storage devices and other input/output devices). This can prevent a SOFTWARE ITEM from running at the intended time. The provision of sufficient hardware is an architectural feature (see  6.2.2.2.2) which should be subject to adequate specification and planning to ensure that sufficient time is available to run all SOFTWARE ITEMS when required. SOFTWARE ITEMS may co-exist in the same memory; this can cause one SOFTWARE ITEM unexpectedly to change data belonging to another SOFTWARE ITEM. In extreme cases, one SOFTWARE ITEM may accidentally change the coding of another SOFTWARE ITEM. Many processors and operating systems offer hardware-assisted methods of segregating memory usage. Where such methods exist, they should always be used. Most such methods will guard against unintended interaction even when there is a defect in one of the SOFTWARE ITEMS. SOFTWARE ITEMS may also interact in unintended ways when they share variables, including global variables, environment variables, and operating system parameters; this can result in unintended communication between SOFTWARE ITEMS if there is a defect in one of the SOFTWARE ITEMS. The sharing of variables between SOFTWARE ITEMS should be minimised. If it is necessary, rules should be published to all engineers to ensure that the shared variables are only changed by a small number of specified SOFTWARE ITEMS and that all other SOFTWARE ITEMS only read the shared variables without changing them. The strongest form of segregation consists of running SOFTWARE ITEMS that should not interact on separate processors. However, careful architectural design as recommended above may provide an appropriate degree of segregation on a single processor. Testing the SYSTEMS in a lab environment may indicate sufficient physical and time resources for the test cases given, while the application load or the execution environment (other processes running on the same box) in the field makes the software fail in a way that causes HARM. On the other hand, when test cases in the lab do show that there is low performance and invalid measures are taken to hastily speed-up the software, these measures possibly break the design and add other RISKS through unforeseen side-effects. Effective segregation should demonstrate that under normal operation: a) data flow corruption is prevented: non-SAFETY-related SOFTWARE ITEMS cannot modify SAFETY-related data; b) control flow corruption is prevented:  – SAFETY-related functions can always execute at the correct time, without being effected by the actions of the non SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS; – non-SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS cannot modify the SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE  items;  c) corruption of the execution environment is prevented: corruption of parts of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM used by both SAFETY-related and non SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS (e.g. processor registers, device registers and memory access privileges) cannot occur. Events that cause any of the above to be violated, e.g. hardware failure, should be detected and cause the SYSTEM to take necessary actions to ensure continued SAFETY. 6.2.2.3 Details on protective measures In many cases, it is not practical to avoid all HAZARDS by inherent safe design or to implement fault-tolerance for all potential failures. In those cases, protective measures are the next best approach to managing a potential HAZARD. These measures typically operate by detecting a potentially HAZARDOUS SITUATION, and either intervening automatically to mitigate consequences, or generating an alarm so that the user may intervene.

The interlock function has no role in delivering the therapy. Its sole purpose is to mitigate the HARM of unintentional radiation exposure. In some cases (i.e., where loss of MEDICAL DEVICE functionality does not pose a HAZARD), SAFETY may be achieved at the expense of mission. For example, a failure of a laboratory blood analyzer to provide a result may not in some cases be hazardous, but providing an incorrect result could be. In this example, shutting down the analyzer when defensive programming checks indicate unexpected faults, rather than continuing to operate, reduces RISKS. In a fail-safe ARCHITECTURE, a SYSTEM or component fault, or other hazardous condition, may lead to a loss of function, but in a manner that preserves the SAFETY of operators and patients. In a fail-operational SYSTEM, the SYSTEM may continue to operate safely, but with degraded performance (e.g. reduced capacity or slower response time). 6.2.2.4 Preventing and announcing HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS promptly An important class of RISK CONTROL measure is one which improves the probability of preventing a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. In addition to preventing HARM, consideration should be given to announcing the detected condition to the user. Without this there is a possibility that a subsequent failure of the RISK CONTROL measure would allow HARM to occur. Consideration should be given to the frequency with which software RISK CONTROL measures should run. The software RISK CONTROL measure should run sufficiently frequently to detect the condition before it causes HARM. 6.2.2.5 Risk control measures for software anomalies Software presents a particular difficulty: some events in a sequence leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION may result from undiscovered software ANOMALIES and it is difficult to anticipate where such ANOMALIES may occur or what their effects might be. RISK CONTROL measures can reduce the probability of HARM originating from software ANOMALIES. There will usually be places in the software ARCHITECTURE where a RISK CONTROL measure can reduce the probability of HARM irrespective of the nature of preceding events. If this is done carefully, it is not necessary to anticipate the exact nature of software ANOMALIES in order to prevent them from causing HARM. In cases where this approach is not practicable, for example if a preventive measure is implemented in software, methods should be used to assure the integrity of the software (see  6.2.2.6). 6.2.2.6 Process as a risk control measure If software ANOMALIES could contribute to a sequence of events leading to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, it may not be possible to devise RISK CONTROL measures to prevent HARM from occurring. The best solution in this case is inherent SAFETY by design, so that software ANOMALIES cannot result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION.  When this is not possible, an effective software development PROCESS may be used to reduce the probability of occurrence of the software ANOMALIES. There is strong consensus that PROCESS RISK CONTROL measures are beneficial when considered in combination with other types of RISK CONTROL measures and if defined in detail. If it can be established that the confidence in the software to perform its intended function reliably is very high, and the confidence that the software is fault-free is very high, the software may be treated as a high-integrity component. To achieve this high level of Copyright International Electrotechnical Commission Provided by IHS under license with IECLicensee=Covidien/5962726002, User=li, sandongNot for Resale, 02/09/2014 19:31:47 MSTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,,,,,,``,,,,````,`,,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 34 – TR 80002-1 © IEC:2009(E) confidence, the MANUFACTURER must demonstrate that the software development PROCESS can predictably produce highly reliable, fault-free software. The use of such a PROCESS can then be claimed to reduce the probability of occurrence of software ANOMALIES. It is accepted that increasing the rigour of the software development PROCESS can reduce the number of software ANOMALIES. It should be noted that while testing on MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE can reduce the number of software ANOMALIES, it cannot be assumed that when the software passes all planned tests, no software ANOMALIES remain. This is because in clinical use the inputs to the software will include sequences that were not part of the planned tests. Since MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE is too complex to test exhaustively, rigorous testing can only be viewed as a method to lower the probability of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Testing by itself, however, is not sufficient to establish confidence that the software can be treated as a high-integrity component. A starting point for defining a rigorous software development PROCESS would be to include the activities and TASKS specified in IEC 62304 in the software development PROCESS. Additional items to consider when developing a rigorous software development PROCESS might include: – staff competency – skills, qualifications, experience and training (who develops the software?); – methods –the suitability of the specification, design, coding and testing methods (what is the PROCESS of development?); – rigour, formality, and scope of reviews and inspections (how much static analysis is performed?); – tools –quality of tools such as compilers, requirements TRACEABILITY, and configuration management tools  (what tools are used during development of software?). The predictability of developing high-integrity software depends on having a repeatable PROCESS that is consistently followed. When implementation of a rigorous development PROCESS is used to reduce RISK of HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS resulting from software ANOMALIES, the effectiveness of the RISK CONTROL measures should be demonstrated by collecting and analyzing data showing the frequency of failures resulting from software ANOMALIES. To support the claim that a PROCESS produces high-integrity software, there should be evidence that there are no or very infrequent software failures. 6.2.3 SOFTWARE OF UNKNOWN PROVENANCE (SOUP) considerations The use of SOUP is often determined during the SYSTEM design. The higher the potential RISKS of the MEDICAL DEVICE, the more closely potential failure modes of SOUP should be analyzed and RISK CONTROL measures identified. SOUP generally can not be modified to incorporate new RISK CONTROL measures needed to monitor or isolate SOUP to prevent it from contributing to HAZARDS or HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS if it fails. Nor is there adequate internal design information available to identify all the potential HAZARDS caused by SOUP. Therefore the SYSTEM and software ARCHITECTURE should be designed to provide RISK CONTROL measures needed to monitor or isolate SOUP to prevent it from causing HAZARDS if it fails. When SOUP is included in the MEDICAL DEVICE, care must be taken to prevent compromising MEDICAL DEVICE SAFETY. Such a situation may call for the introduction of “wrappers” or a middleware ARCHITECTURE. The middleware may: a) prevent the use of features of the SOUP that one does not want to use, b) perform logical checks to ensure correct information is transferred between the SOUP and the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, or c) provide additional information needed by the MEDICAL DEVICE.

An ARCHITECTURE should be established that permits changes (e.g. stability, SECURITY) to the software platform, based on a thorough RISK ASSESSMENT without compromising SAFETY. Such a RISK ASSESSMENT should include an analysis of the frequency of changes necessary to ensure MEDICAL DEVICE SAFETY integrity; such as installing network SECURITY patches. 6.3 Implementation of RISK CONTROL measure(s) Text of ISO 14971:2007 6.3   Implementation of RISK CONTROL measure(s)  The MANUFACTURER shall implement the RISK CONTROL measure(s) selected in 6.2. Implementation of each RISK CONTROL measure shall be verified. This VERIFICATION shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. The effectiveness of the RISK CONTROL measure(s) shall be verified and the results shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. NOTE The VERIFICATION of effectiveness can include validation activities. Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Once RISK CONTROL measures are identified they need to be implemented and their effectiveness verified.  VERIFICATION that the RISK CONTROL measures have been properly implemented and are effective at controlling the RISK is essential for software. Both analysis and testing are likely to be necessary.  Key aspects to consider include: a) TRACEABILITY to assure that all SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE ITEMS are identified and all SAFETY-related functionality is specified, implemented, and tested in all relevant VERSIONS and  variants (e.g. for different platforms, languages, or MEDICAL DEVICE models) of the software; b) greater rigour and coverage when testing RISK CONTROL measures including testing under a wide range of abnormal and stress conditions; c) focus on regression testing RISK CONTROL measures and SAFETY-related functionality when changes are made, even if the changes are not intended to affect SAFETY. If a process is used that is thought to be rigorous enough to create high-integrity software, the results must still be verified. ANOMALY information collected during VERIFICATION and validation activities is often useful if root cause analysis was performed and anomaly criticality ratings (see Subclause 9.1 of IEC 62304:2006) associated with SAFETY are tracked and evaluated. ANOMALIES with SAFETY consequences can be evaluated to determine if they were identified in the RISK ASSESSMENT and if identified RISK CONTROL measures would suffice for them once implemented. Data on software ANOMALIES may be used to demonstrate software development PROCESS effectiveness, or to identify aspects of the software development PROCESS that need improvement in order to claim it reduces RISK. The adequacy of software RISK CONTROL measures may not be as obvious as the adequacy of hardware RISK CONTROL measures. For this reason when dealing with software, one should consider if the documentation of the RISK ASSESSMENT requires other formats than traditionally would be required. One way that can be useful is to write “SAFETY cases” (see  Annex E).

The results of this evaluation shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  If the RESIDUAL RISK is not judged acceptable using these criteria, further RISK CONTROL measures shall be applied (see 6.2).  For RESIDUAL RISKS that are judged acceptable, the MANUFACTURER shall decide which RESIDUAL RISKS to disclose and what information is necessary to include in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS in order to disclose those RESIDUAL RISKS.  NOTE Guidance on how RESIDUAL RISK(S) can be disclosed is provided in Annex J.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE and the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.  RESIDUAL RISK due to software needs to be included in the RESIDUAL RISK associated with the MEDICAL DEVICE at the SYSTEM level. Given the difficulty in estimating the probability of software ANOMALIES, RESIDUAL RISK EVALUATION usually involves determining whether all sequences of events which lead to unacceptable RISK have RISK CONTROL measures to reduce the probability of their occurrence or to limit the SEVERITY of HARM to an acceptable level as defined in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan (see  3.4.1). Any software ANOMALIES identified (during VERIFICATION and validation activities) that are not corrected should be analyzed to determine if they affect SAFETY-RELATED SOFTWARE (see Subclause 5.8.3 of IEC 62304:2006).  If so, RISK from these ANOMALIES needs to be evaluated and used in evaluating the RESIDUAL RISK of any HAZARDOUS SITUATION they can impact. 6.5 RISK/benefit analysis Text of ISO 14971:2007 6.5   RISK/benefit analysis  If the RESIDUAL RISK is not judged acceptable using the criteria established in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan and further RISK CONTROL is not practicable, the MANUFACTURER may gather and review data and literature to determine if the medical benefits of the INTENDED USE outweigh the RESIDUAL RISK. If this evidence does not support the conclusion that the medical benefits outweigh the RESIDUAL RISK, then the RISK remains unacceptable. If the medical benefits outweigh the RESIDUAL RISK, then proceed to 6.6.  For RISKS that are demonstrated to be outweighed by the benefits, the MANUFACTURER shall decide which information for SAFETY is necessary to disclose the RESIDUAL RISK.  The results of this evaluation shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  NOTE See also D.6.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  No additional guidance for software.

The results of this review shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  A rigorous software configuration management PROCESS, including rigorous change control (see Subclause 8.2 of IEC 62304:2006), is essential so that the introduction of a software RISK CONTROL measure is examined carefully for its impact on other parts of the MEDICAL DEVICE (see also Subclause 7.4 of IEC 62304:2006). ISO 14971 does not prescribe a design and development PROCESS. One effect of this is that when a RISK CONTROL measure has been implemented, ISO 14971 simply requires that it be reviewed to ensure that it has not caused any further HAZARDS. This should not be interpreted as an instruction to examine this question only after the implementation is complete. For software RISK CONTROL measures, it is especially important that this review should not be left until the software has been implemented. As soon as the software RISK CONTROL measure has been specified, it should be placed under configuration management and reviewed to discover adverse side effects including the inadvertent creation of new HAZARDS or HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Implementation of a RISK CONTROL measure that makes the software design significantly more complex may increase the potential for additional software ANOMALIES or cause new HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. RISK CONTROL measures should be as simple as practicable and should always be subjected to a new RISK ASSESSMENT. This review should be repeated (as a minimum) after software design and after SOFTWARE SYSTEM test. 6.7 Completeness of RISK CONTROL Text of ISO 14971:2007 6.7   Completeness of RISK CONTROL  The MANUFACTURER shall ensure that the RISK(S) from all identified HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS have been considered. The results of this activity shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.   Subclause 7.3.3 of IEC 62304:2006 should be considered for inclusion in the completeness of RISK CONTROL when software is a contributing factor in HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.

NOTE 1 For guidance on overall RESIDUAL RISK EVALUATION, see D.7.  If the overall RESIDUAL RISK is not judged acceptable using the criteria established in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan, the MANUFACTURER may gather and review data and literature to determine if the medical benefits of the INTENDED USE outweigh the overall RESIDUAL RISK. If this evidence supports the conclusion that the medical benefits outweigh the overall RESIDUAL RISK, then the overall RESIDUAL RISK can be judged acceptable.  Otherwise, the overall RESIDUAL RISK remains unacceptable.  For an overall RESIDUAL RISK that is judged acceptable, the MANUFACTURER shall decide which information is necessary to include in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS in order to disclose the overall RESIDUAL RISK.  NOTE 2 Guidance on how RESIDUAL RISK(S) can be disclosed is provided in Annex J.  The results of the overall RESIDUAL RISK EVALUATION shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE and the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.  The evaluation of overall RESIDUAL RISK requires implementation of all RISK CONTROL measures. This includes the software being evaluated in the context of each different SYSTEM configuration that the software is used in. The results of SYSTEM test activities (with respect to all software functionalities and hardware RISK CONTROL) should be evaluated in conjunction with the acceptance criteria. All remaining residual software ANOMALIES are to be documented in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE and should be evaluated to ensure that they do not contribute to an unacceptable RISK (see Subclauses 5.8.2 and 5.8.3 of IEC 62304:2006). Where necessary, the evaluation should be accepted by independent interdisciplinary reviews with clinical/application experts. It may also be necessary to include information in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.  8 Risk management report  Text of ISO 14971:2007 8   RISK MANAGEMENT report  Prior to release for commercial distribution of the MEDICAL DEVICE, the MANUFACTURER shall carry out a review of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. This review shall at least ensure that:  - the RISK MANAGEMENT plan has been appropriately implemented; - the overall RESIDUAL RISK is acceptable; - appropriate methods are in place to obtain relevant production and POST-PRODUCTION information.

The responsibility for review should be assigned in the RISK MANAGEMENT plan to persons having the appropriate authority [see 3.4 b)].  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  Clause 6 and Subclause 7.3.3 of IEC 62304:2006 should be considered for inclusion as part of the review of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. 9 Production and POST-PRODUCTION information  Text of ISO 14971:2007 9   Production and POST-PRODUCTION information  The MANUFACTURER shall establish, document and maintain a system to collect and review information about the MEDICAL DEVICE or similar devices in the production and the POST-PRODUCTION phases.  When establishing a system to collect and review information about the MEDICAL DEVICE, the MANUFACTURER should consider among other things:  a) the mechanisms by which information generated by the operator, the user, or those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the MEDICAL DEVICE is collected and processed; or  b) new or revised standards.  The system should also collect and review publicly available information about similar MEDICAL DEVICES on the market.  This information shall be evaluated for possible relevance to SAFETY, especially the following: - if previously unrecognized HAZARDS or HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS are present or - if the estimated RISK(S) arising from a HAZARDOUS SITUATION is/are no longer acceptable.  If any of the above conditions occur:  1) the impact on previously implemented RISK MANAGEMENT activities shall be evaluated and shall be fed back as an input to the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and 2) a review of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE for the MEDICAL DEVICE shall be conducted; if there is a potential that the RESIDUAL RISK(S) or its acceptability has changed, the impact on previously implemented RISK CONTROL measures shall be evaluated.  The results of this evaluation shall be recorded in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.  NOTE 1 Some aspects of POST-PRODUCTION monitoring are the subject of some national regulations. In such cases, additional measures might be required (e.g. prospective POST-PRODUCTION evaluations).  NOTE 2 See also 8.2 of ISO 13485:2003  [1].  Compliance is checked by inspection of the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE and other appropriate documents.

Clause 6 of IEC 62304:2006 requires the MANUFACTURER to establish software maintenance plans which address the use of PROCEDURES to receive, document, evaluate, resolve and track feedback after the release of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE.  The maintenance plan(s) are also to address the use of the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS and the use of the software problem resolution PROCESS for analyzing and resolving problems arising after the release of the MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. The use of the software problem resolution PROCESS (see Clause 9 of IEC 62304:2006) integrates the RISK MANAGEMENT activities in the investigation of the software problem and the evaluation of the problem’s relevance to SAFETY. It is important to involve a multidisciplinary team including clinical experts, software engineers, SYSTEM designers, and experts on usability/human factors engineering in this investigation and evaluation of the problem (see  3.3). SOUP is also an important aspect of the software maintenance plan and POST-PRODUCTION RISK MANAGEMENT activities. Some SOUP, by its characteristics (e.g. virus protect software), may have frequent updates which the MANUFACTURER should take into consideration for the software maintenance plan(s). Failures or unexpected results of SOUP and the obsolescence of SOUP (discontinuation of support) may impact the overall RESIDUAL RISK acceptability of the MEDICAL DEVICE. Therefore, it is necessary to implement SOUP monitoring and evaluation activities in the development and maintenance of the SOFTWARE SYSTEM. These activities should address SOUP updates, upgrades, bug fixes, patches, and obsolescence. Actively monitoring and evaluating publicly available ANOMALY lists and information about the SOUP field performance allows the MANUFACTURER to proactively determine if any of the known ANOMALIES result in a sequence of events that could result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (see Subclauses 6.1 f), 7.1.2 c), 7.1.3, and 7.4.2 of IEC 62304:2006). Released SOUP patches or updates from MANUFACTURERS may include additional functionality that is not essential for the SAFETY and effectiveness of the MEDICAL DEVICE. These SOUP updates should be analyzed for excessive components which can be eliminated from the medical software release to avoid unexpected changes which may lead to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. As with any SOFTWARE ITEM change, the MANUFACTURER should know which SOFTWARE ITEMS are affected by the SOUP update and perform regression testing (see Subclauses 7.4, 8.2, and 9.7 of IEC 62304:2006).

Understanding these is important for understanding the standard. HARM is physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment. HAZARD is defined as a “potential source of HARM”, and there are (many) causes for the HAZARDS. According to the definitions in ISO 14971:2007, a HAZARD cannot result in HARM until such time as a sequence of events or other circumstances (including normal use) lead to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION (see Figure A.1). This sequence of events includes both single events and combination of events. Annex D.2 of ISO 14971:2007 provides guidance on HAZARDS and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Annex E of ISO 14971:2007 provides guidance on examples of HAZARDS, foreseeable sequences of events, and HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.  Figure A.1 – Relationship between sequence of events, HARM and HAZARD A cause of a HAZARD or HAZARDOUS SITUATION is any sequence of events, the combination of which might reasonably be expected to result in a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. A given HAZARD might have one, several, or many possible causes (sequence of events). Unlike heat, electrical energy or suspended masses, software is not itself a HAZARD (a potential source of HARM); contact with software cannot cause injury. However, software may cause a person to be exposed to a HAZARD, in other words it may contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION.  Software failures (of any kind) often facilitate the transformation of a HAZARD into a HAZARDOUS SITUATION. Software contributes to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS primarily by contributing to the sequence of events which exposes the HAZARD and creates a HAZARDOUS SITUATION.

It also provides example questions to ask during software development that can help lead to improved RISK CONTROL. Some of the information in this table may not apply to all MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. The relevancy for specific MEDICAL DEVICES depends on the INTENDED USE of the MEDICAL DEVICE, the SYSTEM-level design of the MEDICAL DEVICE, the role of the software in the MEDICAL DEVICE, and other factors. This table is intended only as a starting point. This table is not exhaustive but is an aid to the thought PROCESS used for developing safe and effective software. Table B.1 – Examples of causes by software function area Software function area Example causes for HAZARDS Questions to ask Alarms and alerts: Priority Lower priority alarms mask the display or audible output of higher priority alarms   Critical alarm does not persist Do specifications identify how the SYSTEM reacts to multiple alarm conditions? Are there multiple levels of alarms? Do higher level alarms override the audio for lower level alarms? Should any of the alarms persist until the user can acknowledge the alarm? Protective actions Protective actions are not clear for each alarm condition or alarm category  Removal of protective actions once alarm clears are not specified Does the protective action create a usability problem, i.e. can the user safely navigate from the protective action? Shutdown/safe mode/ recovery Safe mode action is not adequate  Safe mode action creates new HAZARDS Is safe mode action appropriate for INTENDED USE? Has the clinical staff reviewed safe mode scenarios? Is safe mode state apparent to the user? User interface Crowded or poor user interface masks the “real” alarm condition  Actions to take in response to the alarm are not clear Has the clinical staff reviewed protective measures for usability? Log Persistent error is signalling a pending failure  Logged alarms are associated with wrong patient Are detected errors logged? Is log large enough? Is log storage reliable? How is log cleared?

If a certain type of software defect can have unpredictable effects on SAFETY-related parts of the software, then this potential should be identified and a RISK CONTROL strategy and specific RISK CONTROL measures developed.

ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 4.1 RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS – The RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS defines only SYSTEM and hardware level aspects. Software is only addressed where it implements RISK CONTROL measures for hardware failures. – The rigour of the RISK ANALYSIS and software development LIFE-CYCLE PROCEDURES is not commensurate with the potential HARM of the MEDICAL DEVICE. – Software is considered as part of RISK ANALYSIS only late in the product development LIFE-CYCLE.  ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 4.2 INTENDED USE identification – Considering only a subset of user environments/ potential computer SYSTEM platforms. – Not considering the platform evolution or need for SECURITY or other SOUP patches. – Inadequate consideration of misuse and user error resulting in potential HAZARDS and therefore their corresponding RISK CONTROL measures are not identified.  ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 4.3 Identification of HAZARDS – Using FMEA or FTA methodologies as if they alone suffice for adequate RISK MANAGEMENT. – Performing FMEA or FTA methodologies in isolation for hardware and software. – Ignoring a whole class of HAZARDS and causes such as: • software errors that have unpredictable effects; • errors in software logic used as RISK CONTROL measures for hardware failures; • errors in software logic for the intended clinical purpose of the MEDICAL DEVICE (such as algorithms for results calculations); • failures of software platforms – operating SYSTEMS, libraries, SOUP; • failures of computer components and peripherals; • failures of communications interfaces; • human factors.

ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 4.4 Estimation of RISK – Assuming single-fault condition concepts apply to software design issues and sequences of events. – Assuming that testing – which can not be exhaustive – reduces the probability of a particular failure to zero. – Assuming, based on functionality, that certain SOFTWARE ITEMS will not be SAFETY- related without considering the potential for unexpected side-effects. – Assigning SEVERITY without adequate clinical knowledge or involvement of those with clinical knowledge (human factors) of the impact of HAZARDS on all potential users and target populations. – Assigning low severities based on assumptions that clinicians will detect failures or erroneous information. – Assigning low severities based on assumptions that all users will follow MEDICAL DEVICE labelling and manuals exactly or without inadvertent error. – Assuming some planned RISK CONTROL measure for a HAZARD as part of assigning initial SEVERITY. If the assumption is wrong, the low initial SEVERITY may cause inadequate RISK CONTROL being identified later. – Using only the potential for direct patient HARM to identify SEVERITY without considering indirect use of information provided by the software to the user, delay of treatment, and other factors related to effectiveness and essential performance of the MEDICAL DEVICE. – Assuming that a clinician would always cross-check software-provided information or could detect misinformation, assigning a low SEVERITY, and based on this not implementing other RISK CONTROL measures.  ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 5 RISK EVALUATION – Using subjective probability of a software ANOMALY to decide that RISK CONTROL is not required. – Eliminating a HAZARD from software consideration due to hardware characteristics and later changing or removing the hardware involved in a way that makes software a possible contributing factor and then not considering additional RISK CONTROL measures for the software. – Not considering a potential software ANOMALY as a contributing factor to a HAZARD because it is assumed that the software would work as intended or that testing would catch all ANOMALIES.  ISO 14971:2007 Subclause 6.3 Implementation of RISK CONTROL measures – RISK CONTROL measures are verified under normal or limited conditions, not under a wide range of abnormal and stress conditions. – Software or data used to implement a RISK CONTROL measures is in components or locations easily accessible to other software making the potential for hazardous side affects high. – RISK CONTROL measures are only verified on one operating platform or program variant. – Some RISK CONTROL measures are not actually verified due to the difficulty of forcing their occurrence (e.g. memory failure, race condition, data corruption, stack overflow). – Assuming that all SAFETY- related ANOMALIES are found during development and that testing assures it will work properly in the field. – Implementation of a RISK CONTROL measure that makes the software design significantly more complex. This complexity increases the potential for additional software ANOMALIES or causes new HAZARDS.

As the MANUFACTURER replaces old archive media with new, they should plan a migration path for old archives onto the new media.

While in industries such as military SYSTEMS, the off shore oil industry, rail transport and the nuclear industry the concept of SAFETY cases is widely known, this technique is not mandatory for the MEDICAL DEVICES industry nor is this annex intended to initiate additional requirements beyond ISO 14971. This technical report proposes that a SAFETY case could be a means of structuring, documenting, and communicating the demonstration of an adequate level of SAFETY of a MEDICAL DEVICE. The SAFETY case could also assist in ensuring SAFETY is maintained throughout the lifetime of the MEDICAL DEVICE. A SAFETY case uses the results of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS to articulate why the software is safe enough for its INTENDED USE and why it meets all regulatory requirements (and could do so in the relevant regulatory terminology). One could view a SAFETY case as a RISK MANAGEMENT or RESIDUAL RISK summary with references to more detailed documentation for supporting information and the evidence in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. It could also include cross references to demonstrate specification and test coverage for all RISK CONTROL measures. To implement a SAFETY case the following steps are needed: – explicit set of claims about the SYSTEM; – provision of supporting evidence; – set of SAFETY arguments that link the claims to the evidence; – assumptions and judgements underlying the arguments; – allowance of different viewpoints and levels of detail. The main elements of the SAFETY case are: – claim about a property of the SYSTEM or some subsystem; – evidence which is used as the basis of the SAFETY argument. This can be either facts, (e.g. based on established scientific principles and prior research), assumptions, or subclaims, derived from a lower-level sub-argument; – argument linking the evidence to the claim, which can be deterministic, probabilistic or qualitative; – inference the mechanism that provides the transformational rules for the argument. For more information on elements and construction of a SAFETY case see A Methodology for Safety Case Development  [9]. Two papers that provide a good introduction to SAFETY cases and goal structured notation are Systematic Approach to Safety Case Management  [10] and The Goal Structuring Notation – A Safety Argument Notation  [11].

The following date wasfixed:  latest date by which the ENhasto be implemented at national level bypublication of an identical national standard or by endorsement (dop)2007-07-01 This European Standard supersedesEN 60601-1:1990 and its amendments. This EN 60601-1:2006 has been significantly restructured compared to EN 60601-1:1990.Requirements in the electrical section have been further aligned with those for information technologyequipment covered byEN60950-1 and a requirement for including a RISK MANAGEMENTPROCESS hasbeen added. For an expanded description of this revision, see Clause A.3. This European Standard has been prepared under amandate given to CENELEC by the EuropeanCommission and the European Free Trade Association and covers essential requirements of EC Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. See Annex ZZ.In this standard the following print types are used: −requirements and definitions: in roman type; −testspecifications: in italictype; −informative material appearing outside of tables,such as notes, examples and references: in smaller type. Normative textof tablesis also in a smaller type;−TERMS USED THROUGHOUT THISSTANDARD THAT HAVEBEEN DEFINED IN CLAUSE3 AND ALSO GIVEN INTHE INDEX: IN SMALL CAPITALS. In referring to the structure of this standard, the term clausemeans one of the seventeen numbered divisions within the table of contents, inclusive ofall subdivisions (e.g. Clause 7 includes subclauses 7.1, 7.2, etc.);  subclause means a numbered subdivision of a clause (e.g. 7.1, 7.2 and 7.2.1 are all subclausesof Clause 7). References to clauses within this standard are preceded by the term Clause followed by the clause number. References to subclauseswithin this standard are by number only.

electricalequipment used in medical practice. The first edition ofIEC/TR60513 provided the basisfor developing:– thefirst edition ofIEC 60601-1 (theparent safety standardforMEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT);– the IEC 60601-1-xx series ofcollateral standards forMEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT; – the IEC 60601-2-xx series ofparticularstandards for particular typesofMEDICALELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT; and – the IEC 60601-3-xx series ofperformancestandards forparticular typesofMEDICALELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. Awareof the need and the urgency forastandardcoveringelectrical equipment used in medical practice, the majority of National Committees votedin 1977 infavour ofthefirstedition of IEC 60601-1, based on a draft that at the time represented a first approach to theproblem.The extent ofthe scope,the complexity ofthe equipment concerned, and the specific nature of some of the protective measures and the corresponding tests for verifying them, required years ofeffort in order to prepare this first standard, which cannowbesaid to have served asa universal reference since itspublication.However, the frequent applicationof the first edition revealed roomfor improvement. Theseimprovements were all the more desirable in view ofthe considerable success thatthisstandard has enjoyed since its publication. The careful work of revision subsequently undertaken and continued over a number of years resultedin the publicationofthe second editionin 1988. This edition incorporated all the improvements thatcould be reasonably expectedup to that time. Further developmentsremained underconstant study. Thesecond editionwasamended in 1991 and then again in1995. The original IEC approach wasto prepare separateBASIC SAFETY and performancestandardsfor MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. This was a natural extension ofthe historicalapproach taken at the national and international level with other electrical equipment standards(e.g.thosefor domestic equipment), whereBASIC SAFETY is regulated throughmandatory standards but other performance specifications are regulated by market pressure. In thiscontext, it has been said that, “The ability of an electric kettle to boil water is not critical toits safe use!” It is now recognizedthat this is not the situation with many items ofMEDICAL ELECTRICALEQUIPMENT, and RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS have todepend on standards to ensureESSENTIAL PERFORMANCEas well asBASIC SAFETY. Such areas include theaccuracywithwhich theequipment controls thedelivery of energy or therapeuticsubstances to thePATIENT, orprocesses and displays physiological data that will affect PATIENT management. Thisrecognition means thatseparatingBASIC SAFETYandperformance is somewhatinappropriate in addressing theHAZARDS that result from inadequate design ofMEDICALELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. Many particular standardsinthe IEC60601-2-xx series address arange ofESSENTIAL PERFORMANCErequirements thatcannot be directly evaluated by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONwithout applying suchstandards. (However, the current IEC60601 series includesfewer requirementsforESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE than for BASIC SAFETY). BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 14 – In anticipation of athird edition of IEC60601-1, IEC subcommittee 62A prepared a secondedition of IEC/TR 60513[12]F F1F) in 1994. It wasintended that the secondeditionof IEC/TR60513 wouldprovideguidance fordeveloping this editionofIEC60601-1, and for the further development of the IEC60601-1-xx and IEC60601-2-xx series. In order toachieve consistency in international standards, addresspresent expectations inthe health care community and align with developments inIEC60601-2-xx, the secondeditionofIEC/TR 60513includestwo major new principles: – the first change is that theconcept of “SAFETY” hasbeen broadened from theBASIC SAFETYconsiderations in the first and secondeditionsof IEC60601-1 to include ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE matters, (e.g. the accuracyof physiological monitoring equipment). Applicationof thisprinciple leads tothechangeof the title of this publication from“Medicalelectrical equipment, Part 1: Generalrequirements forsafety” in thesecond edition, to“Medical electrical equipment, Part 1: General requirements forbasic safety and essential performance”; – the second change isthat, in specifyingminimum safety requirements, provision is madeforassessing the adequacy of thedesign PROCESS whenthis isthe only practical methodof assessing the safety of certain technologiessuch as programmable electronicsystems.Applicationof thisprinciple is one of the factors leading to introduction of a general requirement to carry out a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. In parallel with the development of the third edition of IEC 60601-1, a joint project with ISO/TC 210 resulted in the publicationof a general standard forRISK MANAGEMENT of medical devices. Compliancewith thisedition of IEC 60601-1 requires that the MANUFACTURER have a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESScomplying withISO 14971inplace (see 4.2). This standard contains requirements concerningBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCEthatare generally applicable toMEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. For certain types ofMEDICALELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, theserequirements are eithersupplementedormodifiedby the special requirements ofa collateralor particular standard. Where particular standards exist, this standard should not be used alone.___________ 1)  Figures in square brackets refer to the Bibliography.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 15 – MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT – Part 1: General requirements for basic safetyand essential performance 1 Scope, object and relatedstandards 1.1*  Scope  This International Standardapplies to theBASIC SAFETY andESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE ofMEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT and MEDICAL ELECTRICALSYSTEMS, hereafterreferred to asMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS.

Insulation breakdown isconsidered to have occurred whenthe current whichflows as a result ofthe application ofthetestvoltagerapidly increases in an uncontrolled manner, that is, the insulation doesnot restricttheflow ofthe current. Corona discharge ora singlemomentaryflashover isnot regarded as insulation breakdown.c) If it isnot possible to testindividual solidinsulations, it is thennecessary to test a large part of the ME EQUIPMENT or even the whole MEEQUIPMENT.In thiscase, it is important not to overstress different types and levels of insulation and the following must be taken intoaccount.– Where anENCLOSURE or part ofENCLOSURE consists of non-conductive surfaces, metal foil is applied.Care is taken that the metal foil is positioned insucha manner that flashover does not occur at theedgesof insulationlinings. If applicable, the metal foil is moved soas to test all parts of the surface. – The circuits on either side ofthe insulation under test should be connected or shortcircuitedsuch that componentswithin thesecircuits do not get stressedduring the test. For example, the terminals of the MAINS PART, the SIGNAL INPUT/OUTPUT PART and the PATIENT CONNECTION(S) (if applicable) respectively are short circuited duringthe test. – Where there arecapacitors across theinsulation under test (e.g. radio-frequency filtercapacitors), they may be disconnected during the test, if they arecertified toIEC 60384-14.

Where the distance across the top of a groove is 1 mm or more, no CREEPAGE DISTANCE existsacross the airspace(see Figure24). CREEPAGE DISTANCES andAIR CLEARANCESbetween parts movingrelative to each other aremeasured withthe parts intheirleast favourable positions. Computed CREEPAGE DISTANCE isnever less thanmeasuredAIR CLEARANCE. Coatings ofvarnish, enamel or oxide are ignored.

If there are grooves transverse to the CREEPAGE DISTANCE, the wall of the groove iscounted asCREEPAGE DISTANCEonly if the width of the groove is more than 1 mm (see Figure 24). Inall other cases the groove is neglected. In the caseof a barrierplaced on the surface of insulation or held in arecess, theCREEPAGEDISTANCES are measured over thebarrieronly if the latter isso affixed that dustand moisture cannot penetrateinto the joint or recess.

Available fuelsand oxygen concentrations should be taken intoconsideration when applying these specificrequirements. Where deviations from theseworst case limitsare made (basedonlower oxygen concentrations or less flammable fuels) they shall be justified and documented inthe RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. As an alternative to 11.2.2.1a)5), the following test maybeused to determinewhethera source of ignition exists. First, the place(s) within the ME EQUIPMENT wheresparking mightcause ignition areidentified. Then the material(s) of the parts between which sparks can occur is identified. Samples of the samematerial are then usedto construct the contact pins for the testapparatus (see Figure 34).Other parametersfor the test are: oxygen concentration,fuel, electricalparameters (current, voltage, capacitance, inductanceor resistance). Theseparameters are chosen such that theyrepresent theworst case for theME EQUIPMENT. NOTE 2 For MEEQUIPMENT that includes a circuit not addressed in Figure 35 to Figure 37 (inclusive), either the test voltage or current may be set at three times the worst case values with the other parameter set at the worstcase value for determining whether ignitioncan occur. Two contact pins made of the material to be considered are placedinopposition (see Figure 34). One pin hasa diameter of 1 mm,the other of 3mm.Theelectrical source isconnected to the pins asshown inFigure 35 to Figure 37.A piece of cotton is placed close tothe contact surfaces ofthe two pins. The contacts are constantlyflushed by oxygen with aspeedofless than 0,5 m/svia a tube. Thecathode is moved to the anode toclose the contactsandpulled back to open them again. A minimum of 300 trialshas tobe performed beforeit can be decided thatthe sparks donot ignite. If the sparks get smaller because ofbadsurfacesof theelectrodes, the electrodesare cleaned with a file. If the cottongetsblack because it became oxidized then it is replaced. In Figure 36 and Figure 37, theresistanceused tocontrol current flowing into theinductor and the timeconstant for charging the capacitor is chosensuch that it has minimal impact onthe energy of thespark. Thisistested by visualinspection without the capacitor inplace or withthe inductor shorted. The situation withthehighest voltage or currentrespectively andnoignition definesthe upper limit.

The following aspectsplay an important rolein thisrelationship:a) the inability of the PATIENT or OPERATOR to detect thepresenceofcertainHAZARDS, suchasionizing and non-ionizingradiation; b) absence of normal reactionsof thePATIENT who can be ill, unconscious, anaesthetized,immobilized, etc.; c) absence ofnormal protectionto currents provided bythe PATIENT’Sskin, if thisispenetrated ortreated to obtain a low skin-resistance; d)support orreplacement of vital body functions, whichdependson the reliability ofMEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM; e) the simultaneous connectiontothePATIENTof more than one piece of MEEQUIPMENT; f) combination ofhigh-powerMEEQUIPMENT and sensitivelow-signalMEEQUIPMENT often in ad hoc combinations; g)the application of electrical circuits directly tothehuman body, eitherthrough contactsto theskinor through theinsertion of probes intointernalorgans; h) conditions, particularly inoperating theatres, that can present a combination of humidity, moisture or fire orexplosionHAZARDS caused by air, oxygen or nitrous oxide. When MEEQUIPMENTis combined with another electrical equipment to form anMESYSTEM, additional requirements apply. Thesearegivenin Clause16. In some instances, referencetoother parts ofthis standardis made. If a clause or subclause is specifically intendedto beapplicable toMEEQUIPMENT only, the title and content of that clause or subclause will say so.If that is not the case, the clause or subclause could be applicable to MESYSTEMS aswell as to MEEQUIPMENT. A.2 Safetyof MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS, as described inIEC/TR60513[12], are part ofthetotal safety situation, comprising safety ofMEEQUIPMENT, safety of the installation to which the MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM is connected and safety ofapplication. BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCEofMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSare required forNORMAL USE and forreasonably foreseeablemisuseand inNORMAL CONDITION andSINGLEFAULT CONDITIONS. Reliability of functioning isregarded asa safety aspect for life-supportingMEEQUIPMENTand where interruption ofanexamination ortreatment is considered as a HAZARD for thePATIENT.

Generally, it ispresumed thatMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS are operatedunderthe jurisdiction of qualified or licensed persons andthat the OPERATOR has the skill required for aparticular medical applicationandactsaccording to the instructions foruse.The total safety of MEEQUIPMENTcan consist of: –inherent safety by design; – protective measures incorporated intothe MEEQUIPMENT or additional protectivemeasures, such asthe useof shields orprotective clothing; and– informationfor safety,such asrestrictions in theinstructions for useconcerning transport, mounting or positioning, connection, puttinginto service, operation andthe position ofthe OPERATOR and his/her assistants in relation to the MEEQUIPMENT duringuse.A.3Guidance to the third edition Inthis edition,a number of clauses and subclauses from the second edition have been deleted, e.g. when theclause orsubclause was indicated as“Not used.”However, those clauses or subclausesfromthe secondedition that stated “No general requirement” havebeen retained sothat particularor collateral standards can refertothem. The statement, “No general requirement”,has been replaced with a reference tothe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSbecausethe “general requirement”isthat, inthe absence of a particular or collateralstandard, these issues are dealt with throughthe application of RISK MANAGEMENT. While preparing the third edition,basicsafety standards and ISO/IEC guides have been takeninto consideration tothe extent possible consistent withthe particular relationship of MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM to the PATIENT, the OPERATOR and the surroundings. Theformat ofthe third edition has been aligned withthebasic requirements ofPart 2 ofthe ISO/IECDirectives. All thesections except Section1of thesecond edition havebeen converted into majorclauses. This changewas implemented becausesections are no longer allowed under the drafting rules andthe new numbering system will allowfuture changestomodify a clause without affecting thenumber of other parts ofthe standard. The normative references have been moved from Appendix L of the second edition toClause2. Informative referencesarelisted in theBibliography. The definitions inClause3 have beenrearranged into a single alphabetical listing asorganizing the definitions by category was becoming increasingly difficult and the result less intuitive. The index hasbeen expanded to identify eachpagewherea termis used in thebodyof the standard. A numberof new defined terms have been introduced in support of new or expanded requirements. A general requirement foraRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS has beenintroduced in 4.2.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 203 – Clause8 has beenextensively restructured to bring together in oneclause therequirementsrelatingto electrical safety. The requirements in Clause 8have beenreviewed against thesafety requirements for information technology(IT) equipment in IEC60950-1 andharmonized where appropriate given the particular relationship ofMEEQUIPMENT to the PATIENT, the OPERATOR and the surroundings. Clause 9 on protection against MECHANICAL HAZARDS hasbeensubstantially revised todealwitha wide range ofthe HAZARDS that MEEQUIPMENT could pose to the OPERATOR orPATIENT. Requirements relating to the mechanical strength of theMEEQUIPMENT when subjectedtothestresses caused by pushing, impact, dropping, and rough handlingare in 15.3. The standard now deals with USABILITY in 12.2asopposed to “useror humanerrors.”Section six of the second edition on protection against the HAZARDS of ignition of flammable anaesthetic mixtures has beenmovedto anormative annex. Whilethis annex was originally intended to be informative because the use of such anaesthetics is rare, comments fromNational Committees indicated that someMANUFACTURERS mightstill wantto offer MEEQUIPMENTfor such applications.Thesurface temperature limit in11.1.2.2 forAPPLIED PARTS that are incontact with the PATIENT for 10 min or more has been increased from 41 °C to 43 °C. However, the MANUFACTURER is todisclose in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS if thesurface temperature of an APPLIED PART exceeds 41 °C. Therequirements of IEC60601-1-4 [14] forPROGRAMMABLE ELECTRICAL MEDICAL SYSTEMS, as referredtoin52.1 of the second edition, havebeen incorporated into the body of thisstandard ina newClause 14. The requirements ofIEC 60601-1-1 [13]forMESYSTEMS have been incorporated into thebodyof thisstandard ina new Clause16. A.4Rationale for particular clauses and subclauses Thefollowingare rationalesfor specific clauses and subclause inthis standard, with clauseandsubclause numbersparallel to thosein the bodyof thedocument. Subclause 1.1 – ScopeThe scope of this standard is established bythe referenceto the definitionsofMEEQUIPMENTand MESYSTEMS. Thisis to clearly define the scope of thisstandard ascompared withrequirements for other typesofelectricalequipment. Laboratory equipment within the scope of IEC 61010-1[22] is not covered by this standard except whena MANUFACTURER incorporates such laboratory equipment intoanMESYSTEM. This standard does not apply toactive implantablemedical devices covered by the ISO14708-1 [31] exceptwhere the ISO 14708-1requires compliancewith IEC 60601-1.This standard does not apply toany other electrical equipment unless it fallsunder the definition of MEEQUIPMENT orMESYSTEMS.

Collateral standardsfall into two categories: – standards that address additionalBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirementsthat are common to a subgroup of MEEQUIPMENT. Forexample, Subcommittee 62B developed IEC60601-1-3 to provide general requirements for protection against ionizing radiation inmedical diagnostic X-ray equipment in order that the dose equivalent to thePATIENT, the OPERATORand other staff can be kept aslowas reasonably achievable; or– standards that address additional BASIC SAFETY or ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirements that deal with characteristic ofMEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMS that are not fully covered bythegeneral standard. At the time ofpublication,threecollateral standards in thiscategory have been published by Subcommittee 62A: EMC (IEC60601-1-2), Usability (IEC60601-1-6) andAlarm systems (IEC 60601-1-8). Theeditions of IEC 60601-1-2, IEC60601-1-3, IEC60601-1-6 and IEC 60601-1-8 existingatthe time of publication of this third edition of the general standard were all developed inrelation to thesecond edition of the general standard(IEC60601-1:1988). It is intended thatrevised editions ofthese collateral standards, relating specifically tothis third edition, will bedeveloped andpublished as soonas possible. Asstated in 1.3, thesewill become normative atthe date of theirpublication and shall apply together withthis standard.Until such new editions of these collateral standardsare published,users of thisstandard should apply the existing editions asfar as possible whenthey are relevant totheMEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMconcerned. However some requirements of these collateralstandards might not be compatible withthis standard. The requirements from two of the collateral standardsdeveloped for the second edition ofIEC 60601-1have beenincorporated intothe bodyof this standard. They are: – IEC60601-1-1:2000, Medical electrical equipment –General requirements for safety – Collateralstandard: Safetyrequirements for medicalelectrical systems– IEC60601-1-4:1996, Medical electrical equipment – Part 1: General requirements forsafety– 4. Collateral standard: Programmable electrical medical systemsand itsAmendment 1 (1999)F F19F). While both standards will remain active until all the particular standards based onthe secondeditionof IEC60601-1 havebeen alignedwith thisstandard, they are not applicable whenapplying this standard. Additional collateral standards canbe publishedfrom time to time asneeds are identified. While those standards will not be mentioned inthisstandard, they still establish generalrequirements that needto be considered when applicable. Readers are encouraged to consult the registers of currently valid International Standards maintained bytheir national standards body to see what applicable collateral standards have beenpublished.Subclause 1.4 – Particular standards A particular standard can specify: – clauses or subclausesofthis standardthat apply without amendment; – clausesorsubclauses (or parts of them) of thisstandard that donot apply; ___________ 19) There existsa consolidated edition 1.1 (2000) including IEC 60601-1-4 (1996) and its Amendment 1 (1999).

Clause2 – Normative referencesThis clause provides a list ofthe documents citedin other normative parts ofthis standard insucha way as to make them indispensable for the applicationof the document. However,conformancewiththedocumentsin this list isrequiredonly to the extent that theyare referenced in a normative requirement in thisstandard. For example, if a reference ismade toaspecificclause,subclause, tableor figure, then the user of this standard is only required toconform to the requirements in that clause,subclause, table or figure in order to satisfy the requirement in this standard. Undatedreferencesaremadeonly to acomplete document or to a major part thereof and only if it is accepted that it will be possible touse all future changesof the referenced document for the purposes of this standard.For example, anundated reference ismade toIEC60529because it is intended thattheMANUFACTURER will always use the latest edition of thatstandardwhenassigning IP Codes to ENCLOSURES. Undated references are understood toinclude all amendments toand revisionsof thereferenced document. Dated referencesare made when therequirements of a particular edition are to be used to satisfy arequirement of this standard. Subsequent amendments to, or revisions of, dated referenceswill need to be incorporated by amendment of this standard. For example, a dated reference is made to IEC 60825-1 because relevant parts of that standard are applied to light emitting diodes (LEDs) and IEC/TC 76 was in theearlystages of developinga third edition of IEC 60825-1 and wasconsidering removing the requirementsfor LEDs. References to specific clauses, subclauses, tables and figures of another document are always dated. Clause 3 – Terminology and definitions This clause contains definitions for terms that are necessary for the understanding of the requirements inthisstandard.Many of these terms are inherited from the second edition. However, a number of terms have been added during the course of developing new or modified requirements. Wherepossible,existing definitions in other standards have been copied oradapted.Except whenused tosupport other defined terms,a definition isonly provided if the term isused more thanonce inthe text of thestandard.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 206 – Defined terms are printed inSMALL CAPITALS to assist the reader in identifying them in the body of the standard.When normal case isused, thewordshave theirnormal Englishmeaning. The committeemadean effort toavoidusingthe same word bothas a defined termand in its normal English meaning. At times this has not beenpossible.For example, theword“procedure” is used as a definedterm inStart-upPROCEDURE, specifically meaning a “specific way toperform an activity” ofstarting up theME EQUIPMENT or ME SYSTEM. It is also used in the definition ofPATIENT according to its general English meaning, i.e. “Living being (person oranimal) undergoing a medical, surgical or dentalprocedure.”Subclause 3.8 – APPLIED PARTParts thatcontact PATIENTS can presentgreaterHAZARDS than other parts of the ENCLOSURE, and these APPLIED PARTSaretherefore subject tomore stringent requirements, for example,for temperature limits and(according toclassificationB/BF/CF) forLEAKAGE CURRENT. NOTE  Some other ACCESSIBLE PARTS of the ENCLOSURES of MEEQUIPMENT are subject to tests that are moredemanding than those for ENCLOSURES of other kinds of equipment, because the PATIENT can touch them, or theOPERATORcan touch them and the PATIENT simultaneously. In order to determinewhich requirementsapply, it is necessary to distinguish between APPLIED PARTSand parts that are simply considered asthe ENCLOSURE. Thus, typically: – an infrared therapy lamp does not have anAPPLIED PART because it does not needto bebrought into direct contact with the PATIENT; –the only part of an X-ray table that isan APPLIED PART is the top onwhich the PATIENT lies; – likewise, in an MRI scanner, theonly APPLIED PART is the tablesupporting thePATIENT. However, a part that unintentionally comes into contact with anunconscious,anaesthetized orincapacitatedPATIENT can present the same RISKS as anAPPLIED PART that necessarily has tocontact the PATIENT. Onthe other hand, a part thatan active PATIENT can reach out andtouch might present no moreRISK to thatPATIENT than it presents to an OPERATOR. The definition in the first and second editionsof thisstandard failed to address thisproblem.The second amendment tothe secondedition extendedthe definitionto include parts that canbe brought into contact withthe PATIENT, but the new definition continued to causedifficulties. In this edition,subclause 4.6requires theRISK MANAGEMENTPROCESS to identify which parts, other than APPLIED PARTS, are subject to the same requirements asAPPLIED PARTS. These can include parts ofnon-MEEQUIPMENT in anMESYSTEM. Particular standards should specifically identify theAPPLIED PART(S) in particulartypes of MEEQUIPMENT. Inorder toassesswhich parts areAPPLIED PARTS andwhatare the PATIENTCONNECTIONS, thefollowing PROCESS isemployed in the order shown. a) Determine whether the MEEQUIPMENT has anAPPLIED PART, and if it has, identify the extent of the APPLIED PART (thesedecisions being based on non-electrical considerations).b) If there isno APPLIED PART, there are no PATIENT CONNECTION(S). c) If there is an APPLIED PART, there can be one ormore PATIENTCONNECTION(S). Even if theAPPLIED PARThas no accessible conductive parts, foil appliedin accordance with 8.7.4.7 is regarded asonePATIENTCONNECTION.

A failure of ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE can be either a lack ofperformance (such aslifesupporting performance) or incorrectperformance(such as delivering an incorrect dose to the PATIENT). In general,BASIC SAFETY relates to product properties thatarenot devicespecificand ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE relates to a class of products(such asa defibrillatorsbeing able to deliverthe correct electrical shock). While the termsBASIC SAFETY andESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE aregenerally considered to bemutually exclusive, there aresomeHAZARDS that may relateto both BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE concurrently. Subclause 3.17 – COMPONENT WITH HIGH-INTEGRITY CHARACTERISITCSThe concept of high-integrity refers only to specific characteristics ofthe component. These characteristics are relied uponto ensure safety ofthe product. Such aCOMPONENT WITH HIGH-INTEGRITY CHARACTERISTICS should be identified in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS by theMANUFACTURER (e.g. formaintenance). Seealsotherationale for 4.9.Subclause 3.18 – CONTINUOUS OPERATIONWhile the termsCONTINUOUS OPERATION or non-CONTINUOUS OPERATION areused with regardtothe MEEQUIPMENT,parts of the MEEQUIPMENT can be RATED differently. Forexample,an electrosurgical generator might beRATED forCONTINUOUS OPERATION while the APPLIED PART isRATED fornon-CONTINUOUS OPERATION. Subclause 3.20 – DEFIBRILLATION-PROOF APPLIED PARTA DEFIBRILLATION-PROOFAPPLIED PART is protectedonly against discharges ofdefibrillatorscomplying with IEC 60601-2-4 [15].

Thisincludesany ACCESSIBLE PARTS of externalconnections between other separate parts.Subclause 3.27 – ESSENTIAL PERFORAMNCEIt has longbeenrecognized thatMEEQUIPMENT that does not perform properly couldresult in unacceptableRISK for PATIENTS, OPERATORS,or others. All featuresor functions that mustperform properly to prevent HARM tothePATIENT, OPERATOR or others are important, but not every feature or function ofMEEQUIPMENT isESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE.When a failure toperform would result in unacceptable RISK for the PATIENT, OPERATOR or others, then those features or functionsare, for thepurposesof this standard, seenasESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. Assessment of thisRISK is madeon theassumption that the performance aspectinquestion hasbeen lostor degraded,and takes account of theprobability thatHARM would then occur (which in some instances could be 100%) andthe SEVERITY of that HARM. Application of theRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS then ensures that the probability of loss of the performance aspect is low enoughto maketheRESIDUAL RISK acceptable. A problem withESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE exists when the featureor function in question iseither absentorits characteristics are degradedto a point that theMEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMis no longer suitableforitsINTENDED USE. Examples ofESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE are:– accuracy ofa life-supporting function orcorrect administration ofa drugby asyringe pump whereinaccuracy/incorrect administration would cause anunacceptable RISK to thePATIENT; – the ability of an electrocardiograph/monitor torecover from the effectsof thedischargeofa defibrillator where the failure to recover could lead to an incorrect response by the medical staffthat would present anunacceptableRISK to the PATIENT; – correct operationof analarm inan intensive care or operatingroom monitoringsystem wherean incorrect/missing alarm couldleadtoanincorrect response by the medical staff thatwould present anunacceptableRISK to the PATIENT; or – correct output of diagnostic informationfrom MEEQUIPMENTthatis likely to be relied upon to determine treatment, where incorrect information could lead to an inappropriatetreatment that would present anunacceptableRISK to the PATIENT. ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is identified without taking intoaccount the probability of occurrence of factors that could result in a loss of functionality. Thesefactors are taken into account inthe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. Particular and collateral standards in the IEC 60601 family are expected to identify specificESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. Subclause 3.33 – FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIONThe defined term FUNCTIONAL CONNECTION is used to facilitate the definition of anMESYSTEM. The FUNCTIONALCONNECTIONis a coupling betweenitems of anMESYSTEM, including the possibility ofsupplying power.

This change wasmade sincethe scope oftheIEC 60601-1includesthe safety of animals.Subclause 3.40 – HAZARDOUS SITUATIONAs used in thisstandard, a HAZARD cannot result in HARM until suchtime as a sequence of events or other circumstances (including NORMAL USE) lead to aHAZARDOUS SITUATION. Asa result ofthe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, the related RISK acceptability can be assessed byestimating bothSEVERITYand probability of occurrence of the HARM that couldresult from thisHAZARDOUS SITUATION (see Figure A.8 adapted from the draft text of the 2nd edition of the ISO 14971).

TheEuropean Medical Device Directive uses “intended purpose,” whereasthe UnitedStates regulations use “intendeduse.” Both termshave essentially the same definition. After someyearof experience withapplying ISO 14971, it hasgenerally been accepted that the combined term isunwieldy andaconsensus has emerged to use theshorter term“intendeduse.” The second edition of ISO 14971 (inpreparation) is expected to use “intended use” as thepreferred termwith “intended purpose”beingan“admitted term.” To avoid being out of stepwith the future edition of ISO 14971, thisstandard hasadopted the shorterdefined term INTENDED USE. The definition itself isidentical to that in ISO14971:2000 and to thedefinition that is expected tobe in the secondedition of ISO 14971. Subclause 3.49 – MAINS PARTA definition of MAINS PART is needed to identify the parts to which certain requirementsapply.The definition given inthe first and second editions ofthis standard depended on anotherdefined term, “conductive connection.” During the development of this edition, adifficulty withthe definition of “conductive connection” became apparent andthe requirements were revised so thedefined term was no longer needed.This necessitateda newdefinition ofMAINS PARTfocussing onthe MEANS OF PROTECTIONthat separatetheMAINS PART from otherparts. Subclause 3.50 – MAINS PLUGA definitionofMAINS PLUG is needed to identify the plug to which certain requirements apply. The words “mains plug” without a definition would also cover otherconnectors within MEEQUIPMENT that carryMAINS VOLTAGE. Subclause 3.56 – MAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGESeveral requirements and tests of this standard relate to the possibility that an unintendedvoltage originatingfrom an external sourcebecomes connectedtothePATIENTor to certainparts of theMEEQUIPMENT. Theactual magnitude ofsucha voltage is unknown but it is assumedto berelated to the voltageof the SUPPLY MAINSinthe location where theMEEQUIPMENT is used. See also the rationale for 8.5.3. In the early stagesofpreparing thisedition, a definedterm “reference supply voltage” was introduced to avoid repetitionof extensivewording.During thereview of theNationalCommittees’ comments on an early draft, it became apparent that there wassome confusion between the defined term “referencesupply voltage” and the undefined term“reference voltage” which was used inrelation to the requirements for dielectricstrength, CREEPAGE DISTANCES and AIR CLEARANCES. In orderto clarify the requirements,the term “reference supply voltage” has been replaced byMAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGEand “reference voltage” has been replaced by the definedterms WORKING VOLTAGE and PEAK WORKING VOLTAGE. Subclause 3.57 – MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKING PRESSUREThe MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKINGPRESSURE is decided by a competent person, taking intoaccount the original design specification, the manufacturer's rating, the currentcondition ofthe vessel and the circumstances of use.

Thisconcept, withthe general requirementforMEEQUIPMENT to have twoMEANS OF PROTECTION, fitted in well with thesingle fault philosophy, which all agreed was to be retained inthe thirdedition.It enables a consistentapproachto carry through a design effort without getting boggeddown in thewordy prescriptivesubclauses. The concept alsofittedin well when it was decidedto differentiate protectionofPATIENTS from protection ofOPERATORS. Some National Committee comments during the development of this editionsuggested thattheconcept could be extended to apply to protection againstHAZARDS other than electricshock. Howeverit was decidedthat such a change wouldnot be justified bythe benefits.Subclause 3.59 – MEANS OF PATIENT PROTECTIONSee the rationale for 8.5.1. Subclause 3.60 – MEANS OF OPERATOR PROTECTIONSee the rationale for 8.5.1.Subclause 3.63 – MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTThe present definition ofMEEQUIPMENT excludes multipleconnections to thesameparticularSUPPLY MAINS, but doesnot exclude different connectorsto differentparticularSUPPLYMAINS. However, connectionto morethan one of different SUPPLY MAINS atthe sametime should beavoided. Whileit mightbe possibleto design equipment with provisionto be connectedsimultaneously to two differentSUPPLY MAINS in anelectrically safemanner, the particular HAZARDS that might arise havenot beenidentified in thisstandard. Subclause 3.64 – MEDICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMIt iscommon practice for MANUFACTURERS, RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONSand OPERATORS toconnect ME EQUIPMENT and other medical or non-medical equipment to MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS.The inclusion of such arrangementswithin the definition of ME SYSTEM brings them within thescope of thisstandardand thusallowsappropriate requirements tobe specified forBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. To minimize the impairment ofthe safety level of this standard, the connection of aMULTIPLESOCKET-OUTLET to the SUPPLY MAINS issubject to certain conditions. Subclause16.9.2.1 requires thatMULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS are constructedto comply with the requirements from thisstandard applying toMEEQUIPMENT. Subclause 3.66 – MODEL OR TYPE REFERENCEThe MODELOR TYPE REFERENCEis intended to establishthe relationship of the MEEQUIPMENTtocommercial andtechnical publications, toACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS and between separableparts ofMEEQUIPMENT. It is also importantfor identifying ofMEEQUIPMENT orACCESSORIES incase of a safety alert or other requiredfield action.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 218 – Subclause 3.67 – MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETThe definitionis derived from IEC 60884-1. Inthe secondedition ofIEC60601-1-1[13], there were definitions for multiple portable socket-outlet and auxiliary mainssocket-outlet. In this edition, these definitions have been merged. A singlesocket-outlet formingpartofan equipment is also considered aMULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLET. MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS are sometimes necessary and offeradvantages and disadvantages, which have to be investigated in order to establish a balance.MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS might be necessary for the following reasons: – to minimize thenumberof POWER SUPPLYCORDS Iying on the floor; – to allow all theequipment necessary for proper treatment or diagnosistobe used despite aninsufficient number ofFIXED mains socket-outlets; – to improvemobility byhavingall equipment onone trolley; – to reducepotential differenceswithin theprotective earthwiring tobelowthose thatoccur in someFIXED installations. The use of MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS should be avoidedas faras possible for the followingreasons:– combinedEARTH LEAKAGE CURRENTS could result in: • excessive EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENT inNORMAL CONDITION, • excessive TOUCH CURRENT in the SINGLE FAULT CONDITION of the brokenPROTECTIVEEARTH CONDUCTOR of the MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLET supply cable; – availability of the SUPPLY MAINSdepends onthe reliability of a singleFIXED mainssocket-outlet; – a complete interruption of electricalsupply is possible andmight requirea long set-uptimeto reactivatethe completeMESYSTEM; – only one PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION to theelectrical installation is provided; thisisless reliable than when each partoftheMESYSTEM is directly earthed; – theprotective earth resistance isincreased.The optimum solution includes installing an adequatenumber of FIXEDmains socket-outlets according to appropriateinstallation rules.Subclause 3.68 – NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGThe definition of NETWORK/DATA COUPLING has beenwrittenso asnot to berestricted toany particular technology, such aselectronic transmission alongwires. The definition allows for wireless electromagnetic transmission, infra-red,optical, etc., aswell asany future technology. Subclause 3.73 – OPERATORThe OPERATOR isdefinedas theperson who handles the equipment, whichcould beMEEQUIPMENTor any item of equipment in the context of an MESYSTEM. This person could be: –a health care professional using the equipment with a PATIENT, – eitheraPATIENT or a layperson assisting a PATIENT ina home-careenvironment, – a person who is using the equipmentto compensate or alleviate the effects of disease,injury or disability, or – the personthat installs, assembles, maintainsor repairsthe equipment.

Many requirements inthis standard are constructed so thatSERVICE PERSONNEL experience the same RESIDUALRISK as thepersonwho uses the equipment for its INTENDED USE. However, SERVICE PERSONNEL, who areoften engineersor engineering technicians, areexpected to havecertain competencies and to take accountof the technical description. Other OPERATORSare expectedto have different competencies andtofollowthe instructionsfor use. Therefore, thisstandard presumes in certain circumstances that the safety ofSERVICE PERSONNELdepends partly on theirknowledge and training to take appropriate precautions when gainingaccess to hazardous parts. TheotherOPERATORS are presumed to be competent to use the MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMbutare not necessarily competent to avoidRISKS that canariseduring servicing. Subclause 3.75 – OXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTAt a 25% oxygen concentration, the increase in the burning rate ofa paperstrip is only moderate (30 %) (perNFPA 99[42]). In NFPA 99, 23,5 % isdefined to be oxygen-enriched atmosphere thatrequires protective measures, but it allows this valuealso for oxygen chambers atpressures of morethan 200kPa. NASA allows concentrations of 25,9 % inits space shuttles(NFPA 53[41]). UL 2601-1[44] uses 25% asthreshold value.A sampleof epoxy circuit board materialburns incompletely at 20,9% and 25,9% (burning length of 3cm and 8,3cm) butcompletely at30% according toRimanosky, E.M. et al., ASTM STP 1267 [36]. When first considering therelationship between flame rateand the amount of oxygen, it would seem reasonable that the flamerate would be proportional to the total locally available amount of oxygen, whichis givenby thepartialpressure. However, experience shows thatthis isonly trueto a degree. Figures C-1.2.2(a) and (b)in NFPA 53:1999 andFigure A.3.3.14.4in NFPA 99:2002 showthatfor paper stripstheincrease offlame rate with oxygen concentration at aset absolute pressure is stronger than the increase of flame ratewithabsolutepressure at a set concentration.For the borderline “complete combustion” to“incomplete combustion” the oxygen concentration seemsto cometothe same number (14 %)at high pressures, independentof the absolute(and partial)pressure. Therefore, to be on thesafe side, two numbersare given in the definition. Theconcentration limit makessure that for smaller ambient pressures thanone atmosphere the dangerdoes not increase. Thepartial pressurelimit makessure that for higher pressures (e.g. in oxygen chambers)the situation issafe. Subclause 3.77 – PATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENTPATIENT AUXILIARYCURRENT is a current that isnecessary for:– theMEEQUIPMENT to perform its function, e.g. electrical impedance imaging, monitoringofrespiration by impedance changes; – monitoringthe correct operation of the MEEQUIPMENT, e.g.contact impedance ofelectrodes withthePATIENT; –the functioning of the MEEQUIPMENT; or that is incidental to the functioning of the MEEQUIPMENT.An example is the bias current of an amplifier for physiological signals. PATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENT could have a function, but not a physiological function, or it couldhave no function.

Particular limits are placed on the magnitudeofthese currents, both in the NORMAL CONDITION and in various fault conditions. NOTE The current that flows through the PATIENT between various PATIENT CONNECTIONS is known as PATIENTAUXILIARY CURRENT. The LEAKAGE CURRENT that flows through the PATIENT to earth is known as PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT. The definition of PATIENTCONNECTION is intended to ensure the identification of each individual part of the APPLIED PART between which current could flow asPATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENT, and from which PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT couldflow intoan earthedPATIENT. In some casesit will be necessaryto carry out PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT and PATIENTAUXILIARY CURRENT measurements todetermine whichparts of the APPLIED PARTS are individualPATIENTCONNECTIONS. PATIENTCONNECTIONS are not always accessible to touch. Any conductive partsof theAPPLIEDPARTthat come into electrical contact with the PATIENT, or which areprevented from doing soonly by insulation or air gaps thatdo not comply with therelevantdielectricstrength tests or AIR CLEARANCE and CREEPAGE DISTANCE requirementsspecified in thisstandard, arePATIENTCONNECTIONS. See also the rationale for 3.8. Examples include the following. –A table top supportinga PATIENT is anAPPLIED PART. Sheets do not provide adequate insulation and the conductive parts of the table top would therefore be classified asPATIENTCONNECTIONS. –The administration set or needleof an infusion controllerisanAPPLIED PART. Conductiveparts ofthe controller separated fromthe (potentially conducting) fluid column byinadequate insulationwould bePATIENTCONNECTIONS. Where anAPPLIED PART has a surface of insulating material, 8.7.4.7 d) specifies that it istested using foil or saline solution. Thisisthen considered as aPATIENTCONNECTION. Subclause 3.79 – PATIENT ENVIRONMENTIt isdifficult for this standard todefinedimensions for the volume inwhichdiagnosis, monitoring ortreatment occurs. The dimensions for the PATIENT ENVIRONMENT given in Figure A.9 have been justified inpractice.

Figure A.9 – Example of PATIENT ENVIRONMENTSubclause 3.81 – PEAK WORKING VOLTAGEThisdefinitionwas taken from IEC60950-1:2001, subclause 1.2.9.7.Use of this termalongwith the defined term WORKING VOLTAGE should make the INSULATION CO-ORDINATIONrequirementsincorporated from IEC 60950-1easier tounderstand for those already familiar withthat standard. See also the rationale for 3.56. Subclause 3.99 – REINFORCED INSULATIONThe term“insulation system”does not imply that theinsulation has to beonehomogeneous piece. It could comprise several layersthat cannot betested separately asSUPPLEMENTARY orBASIC INSULATION. Subclause 3.110– SECONDARY CIRCUITThisdefinition isbased on thedefinition of the same term in IEC60950-1:2001,subclause1.2.8.4 and identifies circuits that are subject to lower transient overvoltages than the MAINS PART and thereforehave lower values for dielectricstrength test voltagesandAIR CLEARANCES. Subclause 3.112– SEPARATION DEVICEAssembly ofequipment intoanMESYSTEM could involveconnections that transfer poweror signals.In both cases,the same separation requirements areneeded.

Alternatively a SIGNAL INPUT/OUTPUT PART could have no conductive connections, in which caseit will automatically satisfy the requirements for electricalBASIC SAFETY. Subclause 3.120– SUPPLY MAINSAn external d.c. power source(e.g. in an ambulance) isconsidered asaSUPPLY MAINS. MEEQUIPMENT specified forconnection tosuch a powersource has tosatisfy all requirements for mains poweredMEEQUIPMENT. In the past,someMEEQUIPMENT specified for such a power source hashada direct connection between theENCLOSURE andoneside of thesupply, presumedto be at earth potential. In the event of interruption ofthe connectiontothis side ofthe supply, the ENCLOSURE of such MEEQUIPMENT assumes the supply potential and wouldtherefore exceed thespecified limit forTOUCH CURRENT. The first andsecond editions of this standard wereintended to exclude suchan arrangement, but this was not always understoodby usersof thestandard. This rationalehasbeenadded toclarify the requirement. Subclause 3.132– TYPE B APPLIED PARTTYPE BAPPLIED PARTSprovide the lowest degreeofPATIENT protection of all the types ofAPPLIED PART and are not suitable for DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION. The PATIENT CONNECTION(S) of a TYPEB APPLIED PART could be:– PROTECTIVELY EARTHED; – connected to earth but not PROTECTIVELY EARTHED; or – floating,but not isolated from earth to thedegree thatwouldberequired foraTYPE BF APPLIED PART. Subclause 3.133– TYPE BF APPLIED PARTTYPE BFAPPLIED PARTS provide adegree ofPATIENT protection higher than provided by TYPE BAPPLIED PARTS. This isachievedby isolating the PATIENT CONNECTIONSfrom earthed parts andotherACCESSIBLE PARTS of the MEEQUIPMENT, thus limiting the magnitude ofcurrent that wouldflow through thePATIENT in theevent that an unintended voltage originating from an external source is connected to the PATIENT, and thereby applied between thePATIENT CONNECTIONSand earth. However, TYPE BFAPPLIED PARTS arenot suitablefor DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION. Subclause 3.134– TYPE CF APPLIED PARTTYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS provide the highest degree ofPATIENT protection. This is achievedbyincreased isolation of the PATIENT CONNECTIONfrom earthed parts and other ACCESSIBLE PARTSof the MEEQUIPMENT, further limiting themagnitude ofpossible current flow through thePATIENT. TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS are suitable forDIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION insofar as PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT isconcerned, though theycouldbeunsuitable in otherrespects, such as sterility or biocompatibility.

See also the rationale for 3.56. Subclause 4.1 –Conditions for application to MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMSThe condition for applicationofRISK MANAGEMENT to ME EQUIPMENT and ME SYSTEMS includesreasonable foreseeablemisuse. The MANUFACTURER identifies foreseeablemisuseas part of the RISK ANAYLSIS (see ISO 14971:2000,subclause4.2). This identificationcould include the results of a USABILITY ENGINEERINGPROCESS. Subclause 4.2 –RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS for MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMSA changeintroduced inthe third editionof this standard is that, inspecifyingminimum BASICSAFETY andESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirements, provision ismade forassessing the adequacy of thedesignPROCESSwhere thisprovides an appropriate alternative to theapplicationof laboratory testingwith specific pass/fail criteria, (e.g. in assessing thesafety ofnew technologies). Application of thisprinciple leads to the introductionofa generalrequirement to carry out a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS as partofdemonstrating compliance with thisstandard.The MANUFACTURER isresponsible for ensuring that the designandconstruction of the MEEQUIPMENT renders it suitable for its INTENDED PURPOSE and that any RISKS that are associatedwith its use are acceptable when weighed against the benefits.ISO14971specifiesaPROCEDUREfor the MANUFACTURER to identify HAZARDS associated withthe MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMand its ACCESSORIES, to estimate and evaluate the RISKS associated with thoseHAZARDS, to control those RISKS, and to monitor the effectiveness of that control. Compliance with theclauses of thisstandard thatcontains specific, verifiable requirements ispresumed to reducetheassociatedRISK(S) to an acceptable level. The MANUFACTURER of MESYSTEMSshould make thisdetermination on asystemlevel. TheMANUFACTURER should assessRISKS resulting from the fact that individual system componentshave been integrated into one system. This assessment should include all aspects oftheinformation exchanged betweenthe system components. Even when these components are non-MEELECTRICALcomponents, the potentialRISK related to the integration of these components into the ME SYSTEM need tobeconsidered. Furtherrequirements for the integrationof non-medical equipment into anME SYSTEMare described inClause 16. It gives therequirements for anMESYSTEM and howRISKS associated with non-MEEQUIPMENT areaddressed.It should be noted thatcompliance with ISO 14971does not require that the MANUFACTURERhave a formal quality system in place. ThisRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS resultsin a set of RECORDS and otherdocuments: theRISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Compliance of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ischecked by inspection ofthe RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. In all cases,the MANUFACTURER is to beconsidered theexpert on the devicebeingdevelopedand on the HAZARDS associated with its use.

Somerequirements of this standarduse the term unacceptable RISK, other requirements use the term HAZARDOUS SITUATION. All unacceptable RISKS result from a HAZARDOUS SITUATION, notall HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS result inan unacceptableRISK. In decidingwhich term to use inarequirement the followingrule hasbeen used. – UnacceptableRISKis used when the MANUFACTURER has to, or ispermitted to, make a judgment about the acceptability of the RISK. This judgement needs to be supportedby anappropriate rationale such as experience, historical data, etc. – HAZARDOUS SITUATION is used when the possibility of HARM determines whether certainrequirements apply. In these cases the only determination a MANUFACTURER has to make iswhether ornot a HAZARDOUS SITUATION exists; thisdetermination ismade regardless of theRISKresulting from thatHAZARDOUS SITUATION. – Theterm HAZARD is used when theHAZARD isnot necessarily exposed. Subclause 4.3 – ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCEThe concept of “safety” has been broadened from the BASIC SAFETY considerations in the first and secondeditions ofthis standard to include ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE matters, (e.g. the accuracy of physiological monitoring equipment). Applicationof this principle leads to thechange of the title from“Safety of medical electrical equipment, Part1: General requirements for safety” in thesecond edition, to “Medical electrical equipment, Part 1: General requirements for basicsafetyand essential performance”. For an explanation of ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE, see the rationalefor 3.27.Subclause 4.4–EXPECTED SERVICE LIFEThe EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE needs to be determinedby the MANUFACTURER, as part ofthe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, as a precondition for assessing compliance withmanyrequirements ofthis standard, such as4.5, 4.7, 7.1.3,8.6.3, 9.8.2and 11.6.6.In the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS, the MANUFACTURER should provide information toallow theRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to assesswhen the MEEQUIPMENT is approaching the end of its life. Such information should include the EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE as determined by the MANUFACTURER (e.g. in terms of years ofservice or number of uses) but could also include tests to be performed aspartof preventive maintenance, or othercriteria to allow theRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to make an appropriatedetermination. Theneed forsuchinformationand theappropriateway to present it shouldbe addressedas part of theRISKMANAGEMENT PROCESS. Subclause 4.5 – Equivalent safety for MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEMSThis subclause allows alternative means of achieving equivalent safety tobe used. This isimportantas it permits a MANUFACTURER to use innovative solutions that might besaferor have otherbenefits, e.g. costor performance.Documentation in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE should showthattheRESIDUAL RISK achieved using thealternativemeans isacceptable because it isequal toorless than theRESIDUAL RISKachieved byapplying the requirementsof thisstandard.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 225 – If the RESIDUAL RISK is greater than theRESIDUAL RISK achievedby applying the requirementsof thisstandard, the MEEQUIPMENT orMESYSTEM cannotbe regarded ascomplyingwith thisstandard, even if theRESIDUAL RISK is fully justified byotherconsiderations suchas theclinical benefit to thePATIENT. Subclause 4.6 – MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM parts that contact the PATIENTA part thatunintentionally comes into contact with an unconscious, anaesthetized or incapacitatedPATIENT can present the same RISKS as anAPPLIED PART that necessarily has tocontact the PATIENT. On the other hand, apart that an activePATIENT could reach out andtouch might present no moreRISK to that PATIENT than it presents toanOPERATOR. The definition of APPLIED PART inthe first andsecondeditions of thisstandard failed toaddress this problem. Thesecond amendment to thesecond editionextended thedefinition to include parts that can be broughtinto contact with thePATIENT, but the new definition continued to cause difficulties.Since this standardnowrequires aRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS to be followed, it is appropriate to use this PROCESSto establish whether suchparts should be subject to the requirements forAPPLIED PARTS or not. The exclusion of marking requirements reflectsthe majority view of the National Committeesthatresponded to an enquiry on the subject during the development of this edition. It wouldbe confusing to OPERATORS if parts that are not intended to be APPLIED PARTS weremarked like APPLIED PARTS. Subclause 4.7 – SINGLE FAULT CONDTION for MEEQUIPMENTThe requirement thatME EQUIPMENT is SINGLE FAULT SAFE effectively puts a lower limit on the probability of occurrence ofHARM from aHAZARD. If this probability isachieved then the RISKof the HAZARD isacceptable. In all caseswhere thisdiscussionrefers to theSEVERITY or probability of a particularHAZARD, it is intended torefer to theprobability orSEVERITY of theHARMresulting from thatHAZARD. SINGLE FAULT SAFE is a concept that flows from thesingle fault philosophy described inIEC/TR 60513 [12]. SINGLE FAULT SAFEis a characteristicofMEEQUIPMENT that assures BASICSAFETY during its EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE. For a high SEVERITYHARM, application of a RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS can concludethatthe singlefaultconcept does not achieve anacceptable RISK. Theprobability of simultaneous occurrence oftwosinglefaultsis considered small enoughto be negligible, provided that: a) a single fault causes operation ofa protective device (e.g. a fuse, OVER-CURRENT RELEASE, safety catch,etc.) that prevents occurrence of a HAZARD, or b) a single fault is discoveredby an unmistakable andclearly discerniblesignal that becomesobvious to theOPERATOR, or c) a single fault is discoveredand remedied by periodic inspection and maintenance that is prescribed in the instructions for use. There is a finite probability that a second fault can arise before the next scheduledinspection and maintenance cycle.As with case a) above,for the probability of this double fault condition to be negligible, the probability of each faulthas to below.Thismeans that thefrequency of inspectionand maintenance has tobehigh compared to theexpected probability ofoccurrence of thefault. Thelonger the time thatone SINGLE FAULT CONDITION remains presentbefore being detected andrectified, theBS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 226 – greater the probability that a second fault will arise. Therefore, the MANUFACTURER mightneed toexplicitly consider the detection time inrelation to theoccurrence ofa possible second fault as part ofRISK ANALYSIS. Non-exclusive examples of thecategoriesa) toc) are:– REINFORCED or DOUBLE INSULATION; – CLASS I MEEQUIPMENTin case of a fault inBASIC INSULATION; – abnormal indicationsof displays, defect ina redundant suspensioncordcausing excessivenoise orfriction; – deterioration of a flexible PROTECTIVE EARTH CONDUCTOR that ismoved in NORMAL USE. Subclause 4.9 – Use ofCOMPONENTS WITH HIGH-INTEGRITY CHARACTERISITCS in MEEQUIPMENTThe first step todetermine a COMPONENT WITH HIGH-INTEGRITY CHARACTERISTICS is to conduct a RISK ANALYSIS to find thosecharacteristics that are required to maintainBASIC SAFETY or ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. Havingdone this, the appropriate component canbeselected. Referencecan be made to IEC component standards aspart of thedetermination of thecharacteristics required.TYPE TESTS of COMPONENTS WITH HIGH-INTEGRITY CHARACTERISTICSare only part of the required determination of suitability. Since a particular COMPONENT WITH HIGH-INTEGRITYCHARACTERISTICS has to functionas intended or aHAZARD is likely to occur, additionalconsiderationsinclude as appropriate: –continuous surveillance as part of the manufacturing PROCESS and also after assemblyintothe end product; –particular characteristics of the device concerned;– lot testing; – calibration;– control of manufacturing defects; – maintenance;– EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE ofequipment;– use of relevant component standards; – failuremode characteristics;– environmentalconditions; – anticipated misuse of equipment; – interaction with other equipment. Subclause 4.10 – Power supplyAn alternating voltage isconsidered in practice to besinusoidal if any instantaneous value ofthewaveform concerned differs from the instantaneous value of the ideal waveformat thesame moment by no more than± 5 % of the peakvalue of the ideal waveform. A polyphase voltage system is consideredto be symmetrical if neither the magnitudeof itsnegativesequence components northe magnitude of itszerosequencecomponents exceeds2 % of the magnitude of its positive sequence components.

Clause 5 – General requirements for testing MEEQUIPMENTIn MEEQUIPMENTthere could be manypieces ofinsulation, components (electrical and mechanical) and constructional features in which afailure would not produce aHAZARD to PATIENT, OPERATOR or surroundings, even though causing a deterioration in ora failure ofperformance ofMEEQUIPMENT. Subclause 5.1 –TYPE TESTSThe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS identifies the RISK CONTROL measures thatare necessary toensure that the MEEQUIPMENT issafe. Unless otherwise specified in this standard, testsshould not berepeated. This applies particularly tothe dielectric strength tests, which are performed only attheMANUFACTURER’Ssiteor in test laboratories.In order toensure that every individually produced itemof MEEQUIPMENT conforms to thisstandard, theMANUFACTURER or installershouldcarry out such measures during manufacture or installation assembly as to ensure that each itemsatisfies all requirementseven if it isnot completely tested individually duringmanufacture or installation. Such measures could take the form of: a)production methods (to ensure good manufacturing output and constantquality) where such quality would berelatedto safety;b)production tests(routine tests) performed onevery produceditem; c) productiontests performed on a production sample where results wouldjustify a sufficient confidence level. Productiontests need not beidentical with TYPE TESTS, but can be adaptedto manufacturingconditionsand possibly invokinglessRISK for the quality of the insulation or other characteristics important forBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. Productiontests would, of course, be restrictedto settings (possibly derivedfromTYPE TESTS) that would provoke the worst case situation. Depending upon the nature ofMEEQUIPMENT, production methods or testscould concerncritical insulation of the MAINS PART, of the PATIENT CONNECTIONS and the insulation or the separationbetween these parts. Suggested test parameters could be LEAKAGE CURRENTand dielectric strength. When applicable, the continuity of protective earthing can be a major test parameter.

Subclause 5.7 – Humiditypreconditioning treatment According to IEC60529, theENCLOSURE of MEEQUIPMENT that is RATEDIPX8 prevents, under stated conditions, the entry ofan amount of water whereits presence could result in a HAZARD. The testcondition aswell as theacceptable amountandlocation ofwater are tobedefined in particular standards.If noingress of water istolerated (sealedENCLOSURES) theapplication ofthe humidity preconditioning treatment is inappropriate. Partssensitive to humidity, normally usedincontrolled environments andwhich donot influence safety, need not be subjected to this test. Examples are: high-density storage media incomputer-basedsystems, disc and tapedrives, etc.To prevent condensation whenMEEQUIPMENT isplaced in the humidity cabinet, the temperature of sucha cabinet should be equal to orslightly lower than the temperature of theMEEQUIPMENT when it isintroduced. Toavoid the need fora temperature stabilization systemfor theair in the roomoutside thecabinet, thecabinet air temperatureduring the treatment isadapted to that of the outside air within the limits of the range of +20 °C to +32 °C and then “stabilized” attheinitial value.Althoughthe effect ofthe cabinet temperature onthe degree ofabsorptionofhumidity is recognized, it is felt that thereproducibility of testresultsis not impairedsubstantially and thecost-reducing effect isconsiderable. Subclause 5.9 – Determination ofAPPLIED PARTS and ACCESSIBLE PARTSExcept in special cases, suchasPATIENT supports and waterbeds, contact with MEEQUIPMENTis supposed tobe made with: – one hand, simulated forLEAKAGE CURRENT measurements bya metal foil of 10cm x 20cm(or less if the total MEEQUIPMENT issmaller); –one finger, straight or bent in a natural position, simulated by a test finger providedwith a stop plate; – an edge or slit thatcan be pulledoutwards allowingsubsequent entry of a finger, simulated by acombinationof test hook and test finger. Subclause 5.9.2.1 – Test finger An ACCESSCOVER isa part of the ENCLOSURE that can beremoved in order toallowaccess to parts of electrical equipment for purposes of adjustment, inspection, replacement or repair. Itispresumed that parts thatcan beremovedwithout theuse ofaTOOL areintended tobereplaced by any OPERATOR, not only by SERVICE PERSONNEL, even if this is not described in the instructions for use.OPERATORS other than SERVICE PERSONNEL might not be as well trained or experienced in good safety practicesasSERVICEPERSONNEL. Therefore, extra safetyprecautions are needed toprevent accidental contact with hazardousvoltages. Thatis whyparts such as lamps,fuses, and fuseholdersthatcan be removed without the use of aTOOLare to be removed before determining which parts insidethe ACCESSCOVER are tobeconsideredACCESSIBLEPARTS. BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 229 – Fuseholders where the fuselink isheld ina cap that can beremoved without use of a TOOL areaspecial concern. If the fuselinkdoesnotcome out when thecap is removed, theOPERATORcouldbe inclined to try toremoveit bygrippingthe end of the fuselinkwith the fingers. TheOPERATOR could try to insert a new fuselink into the fuseholder without first inserting it in the cap.Both cases can be considered reasonably foreseeablemisuse. This should betakenintoconsideration with assessing whatparts are accessible. Thereader isreferred to IEC60127-6 [7] for more information on fuseholders.Clause6 – Classification ofMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSMEEQUIPMENT can have a multiple classification.Subclause 6.2 – Protection against electric shock The term “Class III equipment” isused in some other standards to identify equipment that is powered from a safety extra-low voltage (SELV) mainssupply system. The term Class III equipment isnot formally used in thisstandard. The BASIC SAFETY ofClass III equipment is critically dependent onthe installation and on other Class III equipment connected thereto.These factorsare outside the control of the OPERATOR and this isconsidered tobe unacceptable forMEEQUIPMENT. Additionally, limitation of voltage is not sufficient to ensuresafety of the PATIENT. For these reasons, thisstandard does not recognize Class III construction. Subclause 6.3 – Protection against harmful ingress of water or particulate matter It should benoted thatcompliancewith therequirementsof thisstandard automatically allowsMANUFACTURERS torateMEEQUIPMENT as IP2Xbecause the requirementsofIEC60529 forthis rating arethe same asthe accessibility requirements (see5.9). Subclause 6.6 – Mode of operation CONTINUOUS OPERATION and non-CONTINUOUS OPERATION cover the range ofoperatingmodes of virtually all equipment. MEEQUIPMENT that remains plugged into the SUPPLY MAINS continuously but isoperated intermittently shouldbeRATED fornon-CONTINUOUS OPERATION, have theappropriateindication ofon/off times intheACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS and markingson the MEEQUIPMENT (see 7.2.11). Subclause 7.1.1 – USABILITY ofthe identification, marking and documentsFor MEEQUIPMENTto be well designed, its markings and ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS should be clear, consistent, and helpto reducepotential use error.Thus, markingsandACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS should undergothe same rigorous evaluation as otherOPERATOR-MEEQUIPMENTinterface elements. Subclause 7.1.2 – Legibility of markings Markings on ME EQUIPMENT are expected to beCLEARLY LEGIBLE by anOPERATOR over the range of normal illumination levels where the ME EQUIPMENT is typically operated. The levelsused in this testarederived from the following recommended illumination levels for use in interior lighting design [51]: BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 230 – – 100 lx to200 lx isrecommended forworkingspaceswhere visual tasksare performed only occasionally; –500 lx to1000 lx isrecommended for visual tasks of small size orreading medium-pencil handwriting;–1 000 lx to 2 000 lx isrecommended for visual tasks of low contrast or very small size: e.g. reading handwriting in hard-pencil onpoor-quality paper.If markingsare not legible to theOPERATOR under the expected conditions of use, there wouldbe anunacceptableRISK. The Minimum Angle of Resolution (MAR) is a visual acuity measurement methoddeveloped asan improvementon the long-used Snellen scale. The values areexpressasa logarithm ofthe Minimum Angle of Resolution. Log MAR can be calculated from the Snellen scale, i.e.logMAR = log(6/6) = 0for normal vision. Subclause 7.1.3 – Durabilityof markings The rubbing test is performed withdistilled water, methylated spirits and isopropyl alcohol. Ethanol 96% is defined in the European Pharmacopoeiaas areagent in the following terms:C2H6O (MW46.07). Isopropyl alcohol isdefined in theEuropean Pharmacopoeia asareagent in thefollowingterms: C3H8O (MW60.1). Subclause 7.2.2 – Identification This subclause isintendedtoapply toany detachable component when misidentification could present aHAZARD. For examples, normal consumableswould probably need to be identified, but a cosmetic cover wouldnot needtobeidentified.Although aMODEL OR TYPE REFERENCE usually denotes a certain performance specification,it might not denotethe exact construction, includingthe applied components and materials.If this isrequired, theMODEL OR TYPE REFERENCE can be supplementedby a serial number. The serial number canbe usedfor other purposes. Indication of a manufacturingseriesonly might not be sufficient if local requirements requireindividual identification.It is characteristic of softwarethat differentversions can run on aPEMS.The identification ofthesoftware will oftenbe on the user interface,although this might not bepossiblee.g.wherethesoftware does not havea user interface. Identification of thesoftware could need special tools. For this reason, the requirement permits the identification to beonly available to designated people. Subclause 7.2.3 – Consult ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTSIt is not intended inevery case when the instructions for use contain warnings, that theMEEQUIPMENT be marked with IEC 60878 Safety 01 (see Table D.2, safety sign 10). Too manywarnings and unnecessary warningsarecounterproductive. Only when the MANUFACTURER, asa RISK CONTROL measure for aspecificRISK, decides to mark the MEEQUIPMENT to instruct the OPERATORto readthe instructionsfor use, should safety signIEC 60878 Safety 01be used.

A MODEL OR TYPE REFERENCE alone is not sufficient, because different MANUFACTURERS might use the same number. The name markedon theACCESSORYcould be that of theMEEQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER ora different name. Subclause 7.2.10– APPLIED PARTSAccording to the second edition of thisstandard, the marking could beeitheron the APPLIED PART itself oradjacentto theconnection point. Neither location issatisfactory in all cases.Where a conductor thatis not separatedfrom PATIENT CONNECTIONS extendsup to thepoint inside MEEQUIPMENT where an isolation barrier exists, a TYPE BF orTYPE CF marking on theAPPLIED PART itself could mislead theRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION or theOPERATOR into believing that isolation isbuilt into theAPPLIED PARTitself. If, on the otherhand, theclassification depends on the particularAPPLIED PART in use, a single marking onthe connection point would be inaccurateandmultiplemarking would be confusing.For DEFIBRILLATION-PROOFAPPLIED PARTS,if protection against theeffectof the discharge ofacardiac defibrillator is partly in the PATIENTcable, a warning to the OPERATORis necessarybecause there are non-obviousHAZARDS if the wrong cable is used. HAZARDS can includedecreasing thedefibrillation energydelivered to thePATIENT, damage to the MEEQUIPMENTwith consequent loss ofESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE, orelectricshock to the OPERATOR or other persons. Subclause 7.2.12– Fuses Examples ofmarkingfor fuses complying withIEC 60127-1are: – T315L,250V – T 315mAL, 250V – F 1,25H, 250V – F 1,25AH, 250VThe operating speed can bemarked by the letter orcolour codes in IEC 60127-1, which are as follows:– very quickacting: FF, or black– quick acting: F, orred–medium timelag: M, or yellow–timelag: T, or blue– long time lag: TT, orgrey BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 232 – Subclause 7.3.2 – HIGH VOLTAGE parts HIGH VOLTAGEparts present a significant electric shockHAZARD toSERVICE PERSONNEL andothers who could be required to work inside theME EQUIPMENT while it is energized. Becausethe partsare inside the ENCLOSURE, the RISKisperceived tobesubstantially less than that forHIGH VOTAGE TERMINAL DEVICES located on the outside of the ME EQUIPMENT. Therefore,the “dangerousvoltage” symbol(IEC60417-5036) (DB:2002-10) is permitted as a marking to alert SERVICE PERSONNELand others to thepotential presenceof thesedangerous voltages. The MANUFACTURERis permitted to use a safety sign3.TheRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS could determine that the safety signis themost appropriate choice if the personnel exposed to the HAZARDhave minimal training or might otherwise beunaware that HIGH VOLTAGE is present. Subclause 7.3.4 – Fuses, THERMAL CUT-OUTS and OVER-CURRENT RELEASESSee the rationale for 7.2.12. Subclause 7.8 – Indicator lights and controlsFor colours ofindicatorlights see alsoIEC 60073 [5]. Subclause 7.9.1 – General It is important that MEEQUIPMENT or an MESYSTEM is not unintentionally usedinanapplicationfor which itis not intended by its MANUFACTURER. Subclause 7.9.2.1 – General RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS and OPERATORS frequently deal with many differenttypes ofMEEQUIPMENT. Because of thecomplexity of modernMEEQUIPMENT, the instructions foruse are an important part of the MEEQUIPMENT. Somecommonality in thestructure for the instructions for use could helpOPERATORSto find neededmaterial quickly and easily. However, because of the diversity of MEEQUIPMENT covered by thisstandard,noone format will be equally applicable to all MEEQUIPMENT. Therefore,theMANUFACTURER is encouraged,but not required, to use the sequence of topicsin 7.9.2.2 to 7.9.2.16 as anoutline whendeveloping the instructions for use. The problem of languagesused in markingsand inACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS cannot besolved by IEC. Evena requirement that identificationsand ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS have to be inthenational languages cannot be upheld world-wide. Subclause 7.9.2.2 – Warning and safetynotices For CLASS IMEEQUIPMENT, where operation from either aSUPPLYMAINS or anINTERNALELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE isspecified, the instructions foruseshouldstate that theINTERNALELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE is to be used if the integrity of the PROTECTIVE EARTH CONDUCTOR or theprotective earthingsystem in the installation is indoubt. Subclause 7.9.2.6 – Installation The instructions for use can contain a statement saying that the MANUFACTURER, assembler,installeror importerconsiders himself responsible for theeffect onBASIC SAFETY, reliabilityand performance of the MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM only if: – appropriately trained personnel carry outassembly operations, extensions, readjustments,modifications orrepairs; BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 233 – – theelectrical installation of therelevantroomcomplies with theappropriaterequirements;and – theMEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM isusedinaccordancewith the instructions for use.Subclause 7.9.2.7 – Isolation fromthe SUPPLY MAINSA plugand socketprovidesuitable means for isolation from theSUPPLY MAINS to satisfy8.11.1a), but they would not be suitableif they were not readily accessible whenneeded. Subclause 7.9.3.1 – General According to the INTENDED USE ofMEEQUIPMENT, the MANUFACTURER should specify the permissible environmental conditions for which a HAZARD is not induced. Environmental conditions such asthefollowing are expectedto be considered: – the effectof humidity; –the effect of temperature;– the effectof atmospheric pressure; –the effect of shock and vibration; – the effectof ultra-violet radiation.–the effect of the temperature of the water for water cooledMEEQUIPMENT; –the effect of pollution. Accuracy andprecision are not possible todefine in this standard. Theseconceptshave to beaddressed in particularstandards.The values listed belowwereused in thesecond editionof IEC60601-1to describe therange of environmental conditions over which MEEQUIPMENT was required to be safe. a) an ambient temperature range of + 10 °Cto + 40°C; b)arelativehumidity range of 30 % to75 %; c) an atmospheric pressure range of 70,0 kPa to 106,0 kPa; d) a temperature of the water at the inlet of water-cooled MEEQUIPMENT not higherthan25 °C. These environmental conditions were based onthe conditionsin buildingswithout air-conditioning in climates wherethe ambient temperature occasionally reaches + 40°C.In thesecond edition ofIEC60601-1, theMEEQUIPMENThad to besafewhen operated underthe above conditions but it only neededto befully operable under conditions specified bytheMANUFACTURER in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. This edition specifies particular environmental conditionsfor some requirements andtests.Where this isnot thecase, MEEQUIPMENT hasto remain safe and operate correctly overthe range of environmental conditionsspecified by the MANUFACTURER in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. Attention isdrawn to the factthat there was alwaysaproblem toapply a 40°C environmental condition to a ME EQUIPMENTin cases wherethe APPLIED PARTneeded to operateattemperaturesclose to the 41°C limit. The second edition of IEC 60601-1 specified the following range of environmental conditionsfor transport andstorage ofMEEQUIPMENT unless otherwise specified by the MANUFACTURER: BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 234 – –an ambient temperature range of - 40°Cto + 70 °C; – a relative humidity range of10% to100 %, includingcondensation;– an atmosphericpressure range of50 kPato 106 kPa.Amendment2 to the second edition replaced the above list with a requirement thattheMANUFACTURERstate the permissible transport and storage conditions. However, in the absence of other information, the above list can serve as a useful starting point in determiningthe permissible limits. Information onenvironmentalparameters and a limited number oftheir severities withinthe range of conditionsmet by electrotechnical products when being transported, stored, installedandusedcan be found in the IEC60721series [18]. For PERMANENTLY INSTALLED high powerMEEQUIPMENT, it might be necessary to control the voltagedrop in the customer installation to prevent input voltagegettingbelow the minimum normal voltage dueto local conditions. Control canbe done by specifyingthe required apparent impedance of the SUPPLY MAINS. Subclause 7.9.3.4 – Mains isolation SERVICE PERSONNEL need toknow how toisolate theMEEQUIPMENT from theSUPPLY MAINS. Thisis not always obvious,particularly if there isaswitch in theMAINS PART that does not meet the requirements of8.11. Clause 8 – Protection againstelectricalHAZARDSfrom MEEQUIPMENTThe fundamentalprinciple for protection againstelectricshock is that the voltageor current betweenany accessible surfaceand anyother accessible surfaceor earth is low enough not to presentaHAZARD, in all relevant circumstances includingNORMAL CONDITION and SINGLEFAULT CONDITION. Requirements forachieving protectionhave beenformulatedin variousways in IECbasicsafety standards, in previouseditions ofthis standard,andin otherIEC product standards.In order for the fundamental principle to besatisfied: a) parts that are “live”(as defined in the second editionof this standard)or “hazardous live”(as definedin some other standards,such asIEC 61140[23] andIEC 61010-1[22]) have tobeinaccessible (but see belowregarding problems in identifying what is “live”)and b) ACCESSIBLE PARTS includingAPPLIED PARTS have tobe not “live”/ “hazardous live.”NOTE The term “live” was defined in the second edition of this standard as, “State of a part which, whenconnection is made to that part, can cause a current exceeding the allowable LEAKAGE CURRENT (specified in Sub-clause 19.3) for the part concerned to flow from that part to earth or from that part to anACCESSIBLE PART of thesameEQUIPMENT. These two requirements are in principleequivalent but some standards state both ofthem. These requirements in turn imply that: c) ACCESSIBLE PARTS including APPLIED PARTShave to be separated from certain internal liveparts:in general twoseparateMEANS OF PROTECTIONare necessary, one toprovide separation inNORMAL CONDITION and a second to maintainBASIC SAFETY in SINGLE FAULTCONDITION,and BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 235 – d) LEAKAGE CURRENTS(and possibly also voltages and energies) have tobe below acceptable limits. Moststandards includeexplicit requirements covering each of these aspectsof providingprotection. For example thefirst and second editions ofthis standard dealt with a) in Clause 16, with b) and d)in Clause 19and with c)in Clauses 17, 18and20. Requirement a) has typically been formulatedasarequirement for theprovision ofENCLOSURESor barriers toprevent contact withinternal hazardouslive parts.However it canalternatively be formulated in terms of the determination of which parts are accessible. Anyway the adequacyof ENCLOSURESorbarriersis determined byuse of the relevant testfingers and probes. Application of the above approach to MEEQUIPMENT has presented some difficulties. The limits forvoltage and current depend on how, if atall, the part(s) concerned can be connected to aPATIENT,e.g. directly to theheart, directly toother partsof thebody, or indirectly via the OPERATOR.Thishas led to difficulties in identifying which partsare “live”parts. The definition of “live”in thesecond edition of thisstandard refersto theallowableLEAKAGECURRENT.The definitionis therefore difficult to apply tointernal parts for which noparticularLEAKAGE CURRENT limits are specified.Certain partscould be regarded as“live” (within the definitionof the second edition of thisstandard)for somepurposes and atthe sametime as not “live”for other purposes. Forexample an internal part that can source a current of, say, 200 μA has to beseparated from all ACCESSIBLE PARTS,including PATIENT CONNECTIONS inNORMAL CONDITION. The separationfrom PATIENT CONNECTIONS ofTYPE CF APPLIED PARTS hasto remain effectivein SINGLE FAULT CONDITION,because a current of 200 μA from these is not permissible. The samepart can however become connectedtootherACCESSIBLE PARTS and PATIENT CONNECTIONS inSINGLE FAULT CONDITION. Thus twoMEANS OF PROTECTION (DOUBLE INSULATION orREINFORCED INSULATION) would beneeded between such a part and the PATIENT CONNECTIONS ofTYPE CF APPLIED PARTS, but asingleMEANS OF PROTECTION (suchasBASIC INSULATION alone) would be acceptable between such a part and otherACCESSIBLE PART. Furthermore, requirements thatspecify the necessaryseparationbetween parts thatare accessible and parts that are “live”do not easily takeaccount of parts that are not “live”butcanbecome “live,”suchas thepartsof a floatingcircuit that become “live”when a connectionis made toanother part of the same circuit. Consider, for example, the simple situation shown inFigure A.10.

If there is a directconnection at point A, then the otherend of theSECONDARY CIRCUIT is “live,” and even the first edition of this standard would have requiredDOUBLE INSULATION or REINFORCEDINSULATION at point B. If, instead, there is a direct connection at point B, the first edition would have required onlyBASIC INSULATIONat point A; but this was dealt withinthe second edition by addingSubclause20.2B-e, which requiresDOUBLE INSULATION orREINFORCED INSULATION at point A.If however there issome insulationat both points A and B, thennopart of the SECONDARYCIRCUIT is“live”according to the definition in thesecond edition,so thesecond edition of thisstandardspecifies norequirements for that insulation, whichcan therefore be minimal. TheGerman National Committeeofthe IEC discovered this problem in 1993, unfortunately just too late for it to bedealt with in thesecond(and final) amendment to the secondedition of thisstandard. The approachadopted in thiseditionis intended toovercome thisproblem. The formulation proposed for the third editionof thisstandard is tospecify: 1)how to determinewhichpartsare to beregarded asACCESSIBLE PARTS(by inspection and wherenecessarybythe use of appropriatetest probes andfingers); 2) the permissible limits for voltage/current/energy inNORMAL CONDITION and relevant SINGLEFAULT CONDITIONS;these limits depend onthe possiblecircumstances ofconnection toaPATIENTor to anOPERATOR; 3) thatNORMAL CONDITIONincludes short circuit of any insulation, AIR CLEARANCE or CREEPAGE DISTANCE or impedance which does not comply with specified requirements for therelevant WORKING VOLTAGE, and opencircuit of any earth connection whichdoes not comply with the requirements for PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS; and 4) that SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONSinclude short circuit ofany insulation, AIR CLEARANCE orCREEPAGE DISTANCE which does comply with specified requirements for the relevantWORKING VOLTAGE, short circuit of any relevant component, and open circuit of any earthconnection whichdoes comply with the requirementsforPROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS. Thisapproach avoids the need to include explicit separate requirements for particularprotective means,as specified in existing IECstandards. Arguably it could avoid even a general requirement for twoMEANS OF PROTECTION, aspresently specified, but the workinggroup considered that such a requirementis desirable. Where requirements from the second edition that used the defined term “live” have beenretained,they havebeen re-phrasedso asnot touse this term.  Generally, protectionis obtained by a combination of: –limitation of voltage or energy, or protective earthing (see 8.4 and8.6); – enclosing orguarding of energized circuits (see 5.9); – insulation ofadequatequality and construction (see 8.5). The dielectricstrength requirements are included tocheck thequality of the insulation material usedat different places intheMEEQUIPMENT.

Subclause 8.1 b)LEAKAGE CURRENTS are not generally measured intheSINGLE FAULT CONDITION of breakdown ofBASIC INSULATION in CLASS I EQUIPMENT because either theLEAKAGE CURRENTS in thiscase flow only during the timebefore a fuse orOVER-CURRENT RELEASE operates or the use of anisolated power supply limits the LEAKAGE CURRENTS tosafe values. Exceptionally, LEAKAGECURRENTS are measured duringshort circuitingof BASIC INSULATION in cases where there are doubtsconcerning the effectiveness ofPROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS inside theMEEQUIPMENT (see8.6.4 b)). In certain instances the short-circuit condition is not necessarily the worst case. Asan example,an overvoltage device, intended toprevent damage to insulation, could fail in theopen-circuit condition therebyno longer rendering its safety function. Thiscould lead to damaged insulation. It is recognized that in most cases in this subclause, theopen-circuitcondition issuperfluousbut forselect components it wasacknowledged that the open-circuit condition isa valid failure mode.

Subclause 8.4.2 c)There islittleorno justification forthe difference in thesecondedition between thecaseswhere there is acover that is removable without a TOOLand wherethere is no cover. Thelimit values have been harmonized with IEC60950-1:2001 becauseInformation Technology (IT) equipment iscommonly used in MESYSTEMS, and the values in IEC 60950-1 are not muchdifferent from thosein the second editionof this standard. (60V dc isthe same, and 42,4V peak isnot much different from 25 V r.m.s.).Essentially OPERATOR protection isnowbased on IEC60950-1 and, therefore,we need to incorporate the protection requirementsfromthat standard.Previously IEC 60601-1did not havea requirement forprotectionagainst hazardousenergy but there is a definiteRISK fromburn, fire andflying debris.  This is now addressed using the requirement fromIEC60950-1:2001. The limit valueshave been established for many years in IEC 60950 and itspredecessorstandards. Themaximum available energy isallowed toexceed 240VA during the first 60 s after contact with the ACCESSIBLE PART (e.g. it takes time for the current limit circuit inapowersupply to operate andduring this time thehazardous energy level can be exceeded). Subclause 8.4.2 d)As well as partsthatare determined to beACCESSIBLE PARTS in accordance with 5.9, electrical contact with internal partsis supposedto bemade with: – a pencil or pen,held in a hand, simulatedby aguided testpin; – a necklaceorsimilar pendant, simulated by ametal rodsuspended over openings in a topcover; –a screwdriver for adjustment of a preset control by the OPERATOR, simulated by an insertedmetal rod.

Subclause 8.5.1 – MEANS OF PROTECTIONTwoMEANS OFPROTECTIONcan be providedin several ways. Thefollowingareexamples: 1) PATIENT CONNECTIONS and other ACCESSIBLE PARTS areseparated fromparts different fromearth potential by BASIC INSULATION only, but PROTECTIVELY EARTHEDand havesuch a lowinternal impedance to earth thatLEAKAGE CURRENTS do not exceed theallowable values inNORMAL CONDITION andSINGLE FAULTCONDITION. 2) PATIENT CONNECTIONS and other ACCESSIBLE PARTS areseparated fromparts different fromearth potential by BASIC INSULATION and an intermediatePROTECTIVELY EARTHED metal part, which could be a fully enclosingmetal screen. 3) PATIENT CONNECTIONS and other ACCESSIBLE PARTS areseparated fromparts different fromearth potential by DOUBLE orREINFORCED INSULATION. 4)Impedances of components prevent the flow toPATIENT CONNECTIONS and otherACCESSIBLEPARTS ofLEAKAGE CURRENTS and PATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENTS exceeding the allowable values. A surveyof insulationpaths is foundin AnnexJ.Previouseditions of this standard also recognized the possibility of achieving separation by use of a PROTECTIVELY EARTHEDintermediatecircuit. However it is in generalnot possible for thewhole of acircuit to beconnectedwith very low impedance to thePROTECTIVE EARTHTERMINAL. Also, if one part of a circuit isearthed, other parts of the circuit are thendifferent from earth potential, so have to be further separated fromPATIENT CONNECTIONS and otherACCESSIBLE PARTS. Air can form part or all of the BASIC INSULATION orSUPPLEMENTARY INSULATION. In generalDOUBLE INSULATION is preferable to REINFORCED INSULATION. The first edition ofthis standard specified numerous pairs ofparts between which separationwas required, but the listwasincomplete. It was expanded in the second edition but still remainedincomplete, for example with regardto the situation illustrated inFigure A.10. Discussionin theworkinggroup atan early stage of the development of thiseditionestablished that test houses actually have to identify the various circuits insideMEEQUIPMENTand the various pointsat whichseparationcouldbe needed. Thisedition therefore specifiesthisPROCEDURE explicitly. The distinction betweenMEANS OF OPERATOR PROTECTION and MEANS OF PATIENT PROTECTIONwas introduced inresponse to concerns that the requirements ofpreviouseditionsof this standard for insulation testing, CREEPAGE DISTANCES andAIR CLEARANCES were too stringent.

Also many kindsof MEEQUIPMENT incorporate parts, such as power supplies, that havebeen primarily designed forusein equipment complying withIEC60950-1.This led some experts and NationalCommittees to propose that the requirements of this standard be harmonized withIEC 60950-1 asfar as possible. However the test voltages and the minimum valuesof CREEPAGE DISTANCES and AIR CLEARANCES specifiedin IEC60950-1arederived from IEC60664-1 and arebasedonassumptions about possible overvoltages in mains and other circuits, particularly the frequency of occurrence of various levelsofovervoltage. According to the understandingof the working group experts who revisedthe corresponding requirements ofthis standard, compliance with therequirements of IEC60664-1or IEC60950-1 leavesaRISK that transient insulationbreakdowncould occurwith a frequency up toabout onceper year. The probability of occurrence of anOPERATOR coming incontact witharelevant part andwithearth atthe moment when breakdown occurs is low, sotheRESIDUAL RISK isacceptable forMEEQUIPMENT, just asit is for IT equipment. However the probability of occurrence of aPATIENTbeing in contact with anAPPLIED PARTand with earth is significantly higher. Theworking group therefore decided that a larger margin ofsafety should be applied wherePATIENT safety is concerned. However there was no reliablebasis for deciding what additional margin might be applied to the values from IEC60664-1, so thesame values thatwerespecified in the second edition ofthis standard have been retained for MEANS OF PATIENT PROTECTION. For MEANS OF OPERATOR PROTECTION thisrevision of the standard allows the MANUFACTURERthree options (seeFigureA.12).One option isto apply the requirements ofIEC60950-1 and toidentify the appropriateinstallation category andpollution degree. Alternatively, theMANUFACTURER can apply the values in the tables, which have beenderived from IEC60950-1 on thebasis of reasonable assumptions about the installationcategory and pollution degree. The third option is to treat the MEANS OF OPERATOR PROTECTIONas if it were a MEANS OFPATIENT PROTECTION. Y capacitors are used to reduceradio frequency interference by providinga low impedance pathto earthfor highfrequency a.c. They are also usedfor bridgingDOUBLE orREINFORCEDINSULATION as part of the interferencesuppression regime. Thereare four types: Y1, Y2, Y3andY4. Y1 capacitors are designedfor use withthree phase mains and have a WORKINGVOLTAGE of up to 500V a.c. andawithstand voltage of 4000V a.c. Y2capacitors aredesigned for use with single phase mains and have a WORKING VOLTAGE up to 300V a.c. anda withstand voltageof 2500V a.c. Y3 capacitorsaresimilar to Y2capacitors but have aWORKING VOLTAGEupto 250V a.c. Y4 capacitors are designedfor use withlow voltagemainsand have aWORKING VOLTAGE up to 150 V a.c. and a withstand voltage of 1 000 Va.c. These capacitorsare safety critical sincethey providea leakagepath toearth or across abarrier. So they must be certified and monitoredby a recognised test house to IEC 60384-14, which servesto control their manufacture.One Y1 capacitor can be used to provide two MOOP's but only one MOPP (PATIENTS need a higherlevel of protection than OPERATORS).A Y2 capacitor can be used to provide one MOOP only.

An extreme case of the latterHAZARD wouldbe adirect connection to theSUPPLY MAINS, resulting from insertion of the connector into a mains outlet or into the socket end of aDETACHABLE POWER SUPPLYCORD. It isessential to prevent this from occurring. Withcertain combinations of PATIENT and MAINS CONNECTORS it will bepossible toplug the PATIENT connectoraccidentally into the mainssocket. Thispossibility cannot reasonably be removed by dimensional requirements as todoso would make single-pole connectors excessivelylarge.Such anincident is rendered safe by therequirement for thePATIENT connector to beprotected by insulation having aCREEPAGE DISTANCE of at least 1,0 mm and a dielectric strength of at least 1 500 V. The latter on its ownwould not sufficeas 1500V protection could easily be achieved bythin plasticfoil that would not stand upto daily wear orto being pushed, possibly repeatedly, into amains socket. Forthis reason alsoit can be seenthatthe insulation should be durableand rigid.Thewording of thisrequirementwas modified from that in thesecondeditionof thisstandardto avoid use ofthe phrases “conductive connection”, which was eliminated as a defined term. Thischange was a direct result of National Committee commentsduring the preparation ofthis edition.According to the rationale in thesecondeditionof this standard, the test in which the testfinger isapplied witha force of 10 N wasintended “to checkthe strength ofthe insulating material.”This hasnow been supplemented byanexplicit cross reference to8.8.4.1.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 244 – In response to an enquiry, one National Committeestated that this test is“amechanical testof the protective cover overthe pin;” suggestingthat thetest was intended to applyspecifically toone particular kind ofconnector design, in whichthe contact is surrounded bya movable sheath designedtoallow contact withthe correct mating connector but not with other parts. Duringthe development ofthis edition ofthis standard,the question arose whether thistestshould be restrictedto single-pole connectors, asinthe second edition ofthis standard, orshould apply to multi-pole connectorsas well. Some multi-poleconnectors areof similarshapeto single-pole connectors and could similarly be inserted into aMAINS CONNECTOR, so the sameconsiderations of adequacy of insulation apply equally. On the other hand, typicalkinds of multi-poleconnectors that are in commonusecannot be insertedinto aMAINS CONNECTOR, but would fail this test if they were subject to it, because the test finger can easily touch their contacts, evenwithout the application of a10N force. A further enquiry to the NationalCommittees yielded arangeof responses, with reasonable consensusonsomequestionsbut noconsensus as towhether this testshould apply to all connectors or should be restrictedto single-pole connectors. This test should certainly apply to a multi-pole connectorthat is of such shapeand sizethat it could beinsertedinto a mainssocket. In thiscase, the RISK isthe same as with a single-poleconnector.Anotherreason forapplying this test tosome multi-poleconnectors is that the testwith the flat plate doesnot exhaustively assessthe possibility of contact with conductivepartsinthevicinity from which a currentin excess of the allowable LEAKAGE CURRENT could flow. Almost any kind ofconnector, if detached from theMEEQUIPMENT or dropped, couldpossibly makecontact with something besidesthe intended mating connector, but theRISK depends ontheshape of the connector and thecircumstances. In mostcases theRISK is low. For example a typical “D” connectorislikely to make contact with an earthed objectonly momentarily, whereasa straight pincould make contact fora prolonged period. Howevereven prolonged contact with a metal object can result in a HAZARD only if it occursin combination with a fault orabnormal situation that allows anexcessivecurrent to flow through thePATIENT. The RISK isin all casesmuch less than the RISKif the connector can make contact witha mains socket. The requirements of thisstandard should be formulated in relation to theRISK. Thestandard should minimise RISK to the PATIENT, while allowingMANUFACTURERS a reasonable rangeofchoice of connectors. “Any connector” should be understoodtoinclude multiple contact connectors, several connectors and connectors in series. Thedimensionof100mm diameter isnot in the least important and merely serves to indicate the scale oftheflat surface. Any sheet of conductive material larger thanthis would besuitable. Subclause 8.5.3 – MAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGESeveral requirements and tests of this standard relate to the possibility that an unintendedvoltage originatingfrom an external sourcebecomes connectedtothePATIENTor to certainparts of the MEEQUIPMENT. The actual magnitude ofsucha voltage is unknown; but according to the secondedition ofthisstandard it was taken to bethe highest RATED MAINS VOLTAGE, or for polyphase equipment the phase to neutral supply voltage. These values reflecteda reasonable worst-case assumption thatthe actual unintendedexternal voltage is unlikely to exceedthe voltage of the SUPPLY MAINS in the locationwhere the MEEQUIPMENT isused, andthat MEEQUIPMENT is unlikely to be used in a locationwhere theSUPPLY MAINS has a voltageBS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 245 – higher than its highest RATED MAINS VOLTAGE. For INTERNALLY POWEREDMEEQUIPMENT the valuespecifiedwas(and remains) 250V, because this is the highest commonly encountered phase-to-neutral voltage in locationswhereMEEQUIPMENT isused. In early draftsof thisedition, thecorresponding wordingonly referred to a.c.SUPPLY MAINS. This mistakewaspointed out during the comment period.Discussionof this comment confirmed thatthe requirements should not depend on whethertheSUPPLY MAINS is a.c.ord.c., but revealed a further anomaly. If MEEQUIPMENT isspecified forconnection to anextra-low voltage (ELV) SUPPLY MAINS (for example12V in anambulance)but not to any highervoltage SUPPLY MAINS, the external voltage assumed for test purposes would be only the ELV. SuchMEEQUIPMENT could however be used in locations where ahigher voltageSUPPLY MAINSisalso installed. The wordinghas therefore beenrevised toremove thisanomaly. If MEEQUIPMENT has ahighest RATED supply voltage less than 100 V, it will necessarily be used in a special location wherethat supply is available, and we do not know whatothersupplies could also be present. Therefore the external voltage assumed for relevant tests is250 V,as forINTERNALLY POWERED MEEQUIPMENT. HoweverMEEQUIPMENT having a highest RATED MAINS VOLTAGE of around 115V isunlikely tobe usedin locations having highervoltageSUPPLY MAINS, so theexternal voltage assumed forrelevant testsisequal to the highest RATED MAINS VOLTAGE, as in the secondeditionof thisstandard. Subclause 8.5.4 – WORKING VOLTAGEThedielectricstrength test voltages specified in Table6are appropriate for insulation thatisnormally subjected to a continuousWORKING VOLTAGE and to transient overvoltages. The WORKING VOLTAGE foreach MEANS OF PROTECTION forming DOUBLE INSULATION is the voltage towhich the DOUBLE INSULATIONasa whole is subjected, because either MEANS OFPROTECTION can besubjected to this voltage if the other MEANS OF PROTECTION fails. For insulation between two isolatedpartsor between an isolatedpartand an earthed part, the WORKING VOLTAGE could insome cases be equal to the arithmeticsum of thehighest voltages between anytwo points within both parts. For DEFIBRILLATION-PROOFAPPLIED PARTS, a testvoltage deduced on the basisof aWORKING VOLTAGE equal to the defibrillation peak voltage would be far too high for insulation that inNORMAL USE isexposedonly occasionally to voltage impulses, normally shorter than 10sand without additional overvoltage.Subclause 8.5.5 – DEFIBRILLATION-PROOF APPLIED PARTSThespecial test described in 8.5.5 isconsidered toensuresufficient protection against exposureto defibrillation pulses, no separate dielectric strengthtest being necessary. Subclause 8.5.5.1 – Defibrillation protection One or the other of the defibrillation paddlescould, by virtue of its clinical application, beconnected to earth orat least referenced to earth.

ACCESSIBLE PARTS should be adequately isolated from PATIENT CONNECTIONS orprotected in some other way. The insulationofthePATIENTCONNECTIONS cannotbe protected byvoltagelimiting devices relying onearthed connections. The DEFIBRILLATION-PROOFAPPLIED PART markingindicates thatan APPLIED PART can safelyremain attached to aPATIENTwho is being defibrillated without any adverse effect onsubsequent use oftheMEEQUIPMENT. The tests ensure: a) that any ACCESSIBLE PARTS of MEEQUIPMENT, PATIENTcables, cable connectors, etc. thatare not PROTECTIVELY EARTHED will not deliver ahazardous level ofchargeor energy due toflashover ofdefibrillation voltage; and b) that the MEEQUIPMENT will continue to function(at least with regard toBASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE)after exposure to defibrillationvoltage. The requirement andthe testPROCEDURErefer to “any necessary time” stated in theACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. There is no requirement for the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS to include a statement of a recovery time, but if there isno statement theMEEQUIPMENT has torecover and deliver its BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE immediately. Thetests are conducted with theMEEQUIPMENT connected to the SUPPLY MAINS and inoperation according to the instructions for use because the tests deal not only with the effect of the defibrillationenergy onBASIC SAFETY but also on the ability ofthe ME EQUIPMENT todeliver its ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE after the stated recovery time. NORMAL USEincludesthe situation that a PATIENTis defibrillated while connectedto the MEEQUIPMENT and, at thesame time, the OPERATORor another person is in contact withthe ENCLOSURE. The possibility of thisoccurringat the same time as the SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONof a defective PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION is veryunlikely and is thereforedisregarded. However, interruption of functional earthconnections ismore probable, and is therefore required forthese tests.The SEVERITY of electricshock thata person receiveswhen touchingACCESSIBLE PARTS duringthe dischargeofa defibrillator is limited toavalue (corresponding to achargeof 100μC) which can befelt and which could beunpleasant, but whichis not dangerous. SIGNAL INPUT/OUTPUT PARTSareincluded, as signal lines to remote MEEQUIPMENT could otherwise carry energies that might behazardous. Thetest circuits of Figure 9 and Figure 10 ofthis standard are designed to simplify the test byintegrating the voltageappearingacross the testresistance(R1). The valueof theinductanceL in the testcircuitsof Figure 9andFigure10 ischosen toprovide a shorter than normal rise time in order to test adequately the incorporated protectivemeans. Rationale forimpulse test voltage Whenadefibrillation voltage isapplied to the thoraxofaPATIENT, via externally appliedpaddles (or defibrillation electrodes), the body tissueof thePATIENT in the vicinity of thepaddles and between the paddlesbecomes avoltage dividing system.

If the electrode of another item of MEEQUIPMENT isapplied to the PATIENT, roughly within the compass of the defibrillatorpaddles, the voltage towhich such anelectrode issubjected depends on its positionbut will generally belessthanthe on-load defibrillationvoltage. Unfortunately it is notpossible to say how much less asthe electrode in question canbeplacedanywhere inthis area, including immediately adjacent tooneof the defibrillatorpaddles. In theabsenceof arelevant particularstandard, it isrequired that such anelectrode and theMEEQUIPMENT towhich it isconnected is able towithstand the full defibrillationvoltage. This isthe no-loadvoltage as one ofthe defibrillator paddles might not be making good contact with the PATIENT. Thisstandard therefore specifies 5kV d.c. as the appropriate test voltage in theabsenceofa relevant particularstandard. Applying Subclause 4.5,a MANUFACTURERis allowed to use alternate means to address a RISKcovered bythisstandard if theRESIDUAL RISK after applying thealternate means isequal orless than theRESIDUAL RISKafter applying the requirements of thisstandard. It ispossible for a MANUFACTURER todetermine that a lower test voltage isappropriatedependingon the INTENDED USE of the MEEQUIPMENT and the location of the APPLIED PARTS on the PAIENT if it can bedemonstrated that the test voltage selected is themaximum voltage that canappearon theAPPLIED PARTwith5 kV appliedtothe chest. Such parts can beclassifiedand marked asa DEFIBRILLATION-PROOFAPPLIED PARTS. Subclause8.6– Protective earthing, functional earthingand potential equalizationofMEEQUIPMENTTypically, metal ACCESSIBLE PARTS of CLASS IME EQUIPMENT arePROTECTIVELY EARTHED.However, theycould be separated byotherMEANS OF PROTECTION, in accordance with 8.5.Also some metal ACCESSIBLE PARTS could be earthed incidentally, neither by a PROTECTIVEEARTH CONNECTION nor for functional purposes. Forexample, sucha part couldbeincontact with another part that is PROTECTIVELY EARTHED butdoes not itself need to bePROTECTIVELYEARTHED. Subclause 8.6.1 – Applicabilityof requirements PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS that are only relevant to the safety of OPERATORS areallowedto comply either withthe requirements ofthisstandard orwith thoseof IEC60950-1, but thelatter alternative isnot allowed for PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS that are relevant to the safety of both OPERATORS and PATIENTS. Subclause 8.6.2 – PROTECTIVE EARTH TERMINALThese requirements are intended to ensure a reliableconnection betweentheMEEQUIPMENTand the protective earthing system of the electrical installation. Subclause 8.6.3 – Protectiveearthing of moving parts Connections to moving parts, whether made by sliding contacts, byflexible wires or by any other means, could be more susceptible than ordinary FIXED connectionsto deteriorationduring the EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE of the MEEQUIPMENT.

Sucha currentis assumed tohave sufficient amplitudeto cause operation of protectivedevicesin theelectrical installation (fuses, circuit-breakers, earth leakagecircuit-breakers andthe like) in a reasonably short time. It is therefore necessary to check both theimpedanceand thecurrent-carryingcapability ofPROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS. The minimum time required for the test current is intended to revealany overheating of parts of the connectiondue to thin wiring or a bad contact. Sucha “weakspot” might not bediscovered by resistance measurement alone. PROTECTIVE EARTHCONNECTIONS can have zones of higher impedance, forexample dueto oxidation ofmaterials. Use of a current source withan unlimitedvoltage couldprevent detection of such zones because of their ability to flash through. The impedance is thereforedetermined first, using alimited voltage.If this voltage issufficient to drive the specified testcurrent through the total impedance, thenthis one test also serves to demonstrate the current-carrying capability of the connection. Otherwiseanadditional test isnecessary, either using a higher voltageor by assessing the cross-sectional area of the connection by inspection. Subclause 8.6.4 b) The fault current could be limited to a relatively low value because of inherent impedance orthe characteristic of thepowersource, for examplewhere the powersystemisnot connected toearthor connectedto it via a high impedance (see Figure A.13).In such cases, the cross-section of the PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION can be determined primarily by mechanical considerations.

For currents of medium or high frequency, theRISK of electricshock isless ornegligible, buttheRISK of burningremains.Thesensitivity of the human or animalbody to electric currents, dependingupon thedegreeand nature of contact with the MEEQUIPMENT, leads to a system of classification reflecting the degree and quality of protection providedbythe APPLIED PARTS (classified as TYPE B APPLIEDPARTS, TYPE BF APPLIED PARTS and TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS). TYPE B APPLIED PARTS and TYPEBFAPPLIED PARTS are generally suitablefor applicationsinvolving external or internalcontact with the PATIENT, excluding the heart. TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS are suitablefor DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATIONSwith regardto LEAKAGE CURRENT. In conjunction with this classification, the requirementsfor allowable LEAKAGE CURRENT havebeenformulated. The absenceof sufficient scientific data concerningthe sensitivity ofthe human heartfor currents causing ventricular fibrillation still presents a problem. Nevertheless, the publication of the first edition of thisstandard in 1977 provided engineers withdata enabling them to designMEEQUIPMENT; and these requirements have proved over the yearssince then to ensure a very low level ofRISK without being too onerous for designers. The requirementsforLEAKAGE CURRENT were formulated taking intoaccount: – that thepossibility ofventricular fibrillation is influenced by factors other than only electrical parameters;–that the values for allowable LEAKAGE CURRENTS in SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONshould be ashighas isconsideredsafe, taking intoaccount statistical considerations, in ordernot topresent designers withunnecessary difficulties; and– that values for NORMAL CONDITIONare necessary to create a safe condition in all situations by providing a sufficiently high safety factor with respect toSINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS. The measurement of LEAKAGE CURRENTShas been describedina way that enables the useofsimpleinstruments, avoiding different interpretations ofa given caseandindicatingpossibilities for periodic checking by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. Allowable valuesof LEAKAGE and PATIENT AUXILIARYCURRENTS for a.c. and d.c. compositewaveformswith frequencies up to andincluding 1kHz takeaccount of the followingconsiderations. d) In general theRISK of ventricular fibrillation or pump failure increases with the value orduration,up toa few seconds, ofthe currentpassingthroughthe heart. Some areas of the heart are moresensitive thanothers. That is, a current that causes ventricular fibrillationwhen applied to one part of the heart could have no effectwhen applied to another part ofthe heart. e) The RISK is highest and approximately equal for frequencies in the 10 Hzto 200Hzrange.It is lower, by a factor of nearly 5, at d.c.and by approximately 1,5 at 1 kHz. Beyond 1 kHz, the RISKdecreases rapidly [45]. The values in Table3 and Table 4 apply tocurrents measured withthe measuring device shownin Figure 12a), whichautomatically allowsfor thereduced sensitivity at higher frequencies.SUPPLY MAINS frequencies of50Hz and60 Hz are in the range of highest RISK. f) Although asa general rule requirements ina general standard are lessrestrictive than the requirements in particularstandards, someof the allowablevalues in Table 3 andTable4have been set at such a value that: BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 251 – –the majority of MEEQUIPMENTtypes can comply, and –they can be applied to most MEEQUIPMENT types(existing or future) forwhich no particular standards exist. EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENTThe EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENT flowing through the PROTECTIVE EARTH CONDUCTOR is not a HAZARD per se. ThePATIENT and OPERATOR are protected by specifyingappropriately low values forPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT and TOUCH CURRENT in NORMAL CONDITION and in relevantSINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS including interruptionof the PROTECTIVE EARTHCONDUCTOR.

The current density at theheart for 500μA (maximum allowable value inSINGLE FAULT CONDITION) entering thechest is 0,025μA/mm2, well below the level of concern.j) The probability ofthe TOUCH CURRENT flowing through the heart and causing ventricular fibrillationor pump failure.TOUCH CURRENT couldconceivably reach an intracardiacsite if careless PROCEDURES areused inhandling intracardiacconductorsor fluid filledcatheters. Such devicesshould alwaysbe handled with great care and always with dry rubber gloves. The following RISK ANALYSISis based on pessimistic assumptions about the degree of care exercised. The probability ofa direct contact betweenanintracardiac device and anMEEQUIPMENTENCLOSUREisconsidered to be very low, perhaps 1 in 100 medical procedures. The probability of an indirectcontact via the medical staff is considered to be somewhat higher, say 1in 10 medical procedures. The maximum allowable LEAKAGE CURRENT inNORMAL CONDITION is 100 μA, which itself has a probability of inducing ventricular fibrillation of 0,05. If the probability of indirect contact is0,1 then the overall probability is0,005. Although thisprobability would appear undesirably high, it shouldbe recalled that withcorrect handling of the intracardiac device this probability can bereduced to that for mechanical stimulation alone, 0,001.The probability of the TOUCH CURRENT rising to the maximumallowable levelof 500μA (SINGLE FAULT CONDITION) is considered to be 0,1 in departments with poor maintenance PROCEDURES. Theprobability of thiscurrentcausing ventricular fibrillation is takenas1.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 252 – Theprobability of accidental contact directly with the enclosureis, asabove, considered as 0,01, giving anoverall probability of 0,001,equal to the mechanicalstimulation alone probability. The probability ofTOUCH CURRENT at the maximum allowable level of 500 μA (SINGLE FAULTCONDITION) being conducted to an intracardiacdevice via the medical staff is 0,01 (0,1 for the SINGLE FAULT CONDITION, 0,1 foraccidentalcontact). Since theprobability of thiscurrent causing ventricular fibrillation is 1, the overall probability is also 0,01. Again this probability is high; howeverit can be brought down to the mechanical stimulation alone probability of 0,001by adequate medical procedures. k) The probability of the TOUCH CURRENT being perceptible to the PATIENT. The probability of 500μA being perceptible is0,01 for men and 0,014 forwomen when using grip electrodeswith intact skin [45] [48]. There is a higher perceptibility for current passingthrough mucous membranes or skin punctures [48]. Since distributionis normal,there will be a probability that somePATIENTS will perceivevery small currents. One personis reportedtohave sensed 4μA passing through a mucousmembrane [48]. PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTThe allowable value of PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT for MEEQUIPMENT with TYPE CF APPLIEDPARTS inNORMAL CONDITION is 10 μA, which hasa probability of 0,002 for causing ventricularfibrillationor pump failurewhen applied throughsmall areas to an intracardiacsite. Evenwithzerocurrent, it has been observed that mechanical irritationcanproduce ventricular fibrillation [50].A limit of 10μA is readily achievable and does not significantly increase the RISK of ventricular fibrillation during intracardiac procedures.The 50 μA maximum allowed in SINGLE FAULT CONDITION for MEEQUIPMENT withTYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS isbased ona value of current that has been found, underclinical conditions, to have a very low probability ofcausing ventricular fibrillation orinterferencewith the pumpingactionof the heart. For catheters 1,25 mm- 2 mm diameter likely tocontact the myocardium, the probability of50 μA causing ventricular fibrillation isnear0,01(see Figure A.14anditsexplanation). Smallcross-section area (0,22 mm2 and 0,93mm2)catheters used in angiography havehigher probabilities of causing ventricular fibrillation orpump failure if placed directly onsensitiveareas of the heart. The overall probability of ventricular fibrillation beingcaused byPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT in SINGLE FAULT CONDITION is 0,001 (0,1 for probability ofSINGLE FAULT CONDITION, 0,01 probability of 50μA causing ventricular fibrillation)equal to the probability for mechanicalstimulation alone.The 50 μA current allowed inSINGLE FAULT CONDITION is not likely toresult inacurrent density sufficient tostimulateneuromuscular tissues nor, if d.c., cause necrosis.For MEEQUIPMENT with TYPE B APPLIED PARTS andTYPE BFAPPLIED PARTS where the maximum allowable PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT under SINGLE FAULT CONDITION is 500μA, the same rationale appliesas that forTOUCH CURRENT since this current will not flow directly to theheart.

A verylow valueof directcurrent is therefore necessary toavoid tissuenecrosis,regardlessof theclassification of the APPLIED PART. The appearance ofMAINS VOLTAGE, from a low-impedancesource, onthe PATIENTCONNECTIONS ofanF-TYPEAPPLIED PART would have to be caused by a double failureofprotective means in other MEEQUIPMENT, simultaneously connected to thePATIENT andcomplying withthis standard oranother IEC standard, or bya singlefailure of protectivemeans in equipment not complying witha standard. Assuch thiscondition isextremely unlikely ingood medical practice. However the appearance of a lesservoltage, or of aLEAKAGE CURRENT from asource havingan open-circuit voltage ofthe order ofMAINS VOLTAGE, is possible. Since the main safety feature of MEEQUIPMENT with anF-TYPEAPPLIED PART is that the PATIENTis not earthed by theconnectionto theMEEQUIPMENT, the electrical separation of an F-TYPEAPPLIED PART from earthis to have aminimum quality. This isassuredby therequirement that,even if a hypothetical voltageofsupply frequency andequal to thehighest supply voltage to earth present in the locationwhere theMEEQUIPMENT is usedwould appear on the PATIENT CONNECTIONS, the limit for the PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT wouldnot be exceeded.For TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS, the PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTwill be limited to 50 μA, no worse thanthe previously discussedSINGLE FAULT CONDITION. For TYPE BFAPPLIED PARTS the maximum PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTunder these conditionsis 5mA. Even thisvalue enteringthe chest would produce only a current density atthe heart of0,25μA/mm2. Thiscurrent would be very perceptible to thePATIENT, however the probability ofits occurrence isvery low.The RISK of harmfulphysiological effects is small and the MAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGEused for this testrepresentsaworst case, moresevere thanislikely to arise in practice. Total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTThe valuesof PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT in thisstandardare forasingle function of aTYPE BAPPLIED PART or TYPE BF APPLIED PARTor a single PATIENT CONNECTION of a TYPE CF APPLIED PART. With multiplefunctionsor multipleAPPLIED PARTS the total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTcould be much higher. Thistotal PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT is the vectorsum of the individual PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTS. Therefore, it isnecessary to specify limits for total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT. These requirementsarederived from IEC60601-2-49:2001 [16]. This standard doesnot fix the numberofAPPLIED PARTS connected to a single PATIENT. It hasbeen estimated that the number of APPLIED PARTS connected to asinglePATIENT rangesfromone to five. Total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT for TYPE CF APPLIED PARTSFor TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS the PATIENTLEAKAGE CURRENT for the NORMAL CONDITION is 10 μA. The following is to beconsidered formultiplePATIENT functions: l) The current entering the heart is distributed over all of the PATIENT CONNECTIONSand is not applied tothe same small sensitive area of the cardiac tissue. BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 254 – m) The numberof PATIENT CONNECTIONSconnected directly tocardiac tissue isnot likely toexceed three. Accordingly, theLEAKAGE CURRENT entering a single small area of the heart is less than 50 μA and is in the vicinity of 15μA to 20 μA for analgebraic summation ofthe currents. Thecurrent would be less fora vectorsummation. The probability ofventricular fibrillation, according to the rationale for PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT, is in therange of 0,003 evenif all the PATIENT CONNECTIONSare very close together. This isnotmuch different from the probability of 0,002 that is accepted for a singleAPPLIED PARTconnecteddirectly to the heart.  n) The LEAKAGE CURRENT fromAPPLIED PARTS on the surface of the body flows in a distributed manner through the body. According to therationale forPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT, 5 mAenteringthe chest producesa current density atthe heart of 0,025μA/mm2. Therefore, 50μA for NORMAL CONDITION for totalPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT isconsidered acceptable. For SINGLE FAULT CONDITION the LEAKAGE CURRENT for TYPE CFEQUIPMENT hasbeen increased to 0,1 mA. The rationale for PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT givesa probability of 0,07 of ventricular fibrillation for current directly entering the heart. The probability of aSINGLE FAULT CONDITIONwas given as 0,1. This was over a decade ago. Because of improvements in design, morereliablecomponents, bettermaterials,and the useofRISK MANAGEMENT in accordancewith ISO14971 and the consequent use of associated tools, such asHAZARD basedRISK ANALYSIS, the probability of aSINGLE FAULT CONDITION shouldbe much less. It is now felt to be in the vicinityof at least 0,02. The probability of ventricular fibrillationis 0,07× 0,02, or0,0014, close to thataccepted for a single TYPE CFAPPLIED PART. Total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT for TYPE BF APPLIED PARTSThe total PATIENTLEAKAGE CURRENT hasbeen increased to 500μA for NORMAL CONDITION and to 1000μA for SINGLE FAULT CONDITION. As explained in c) above, the current density at theheart forcurrent of5000μA is quite small. There shouldbenoconcern foreither the NORMAL CONDITION or the SINGLE FAULT CONDITION. Total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTcaused byanexternal voltage onthePATIENT CONNECTIONFor TYPE CFAPPLIED PARTS, the limit hasbeen increased to100μA. The rationale for PATIENTLEAKAGE CURRENT states that the probability of failure of protective earthing ofCLASSIMEEQUIPMENT is 0,1 and that the probability of a fault in one MOP is less than 0,1.Thiswas a decade ago.As explained earlier,these probabilities should be much lowertoday and are consideredto be no worse than 0,02.The probability ofMAINS VOLTAGE appearing on thePATIENT is0,02×0,02, or 0,0004. This is belowthe probability of 0,001 accepted inthe second editionof IEC60601-1.PATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENTThe allowable values for PATIENT AUXILIARY CURRENT are based on similar considerations tothose for PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT. They apply regardlessofwhether thePATIENT AUXILIARYCURRENT is necessary for thefunctioning of the MEEQUIPMENT (e.g. impedanceplethysmographs)or incidental toits functioning. Lower values are given ford.c. toprevent tissuenecrosis with long-term application.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 255 – 99,99 99,9 99,8 99 98 95 90 80 70 60 50 10 5 1 0,5 0,2 0,1 0,05 0,01 0 50 100150200250300 68138 208 1τ2τ≈3ττ Standard deviation Mean value IμA Probability %Starmer 60 HzD = 1,25 mmWatson 50 HzD = 2,0 mmIEC2436/05 NOTE  Refer to original papers by Starmer [53] andWatson [54] for interpretation of data.

Since ventricular fibrillation is governed by many factors(PATIENTcondition, probability of current enteringa more sensitiveareaof themyocardium, probability of fibrillationas a function ofcurrent orcurrent density, physiology, electric field, etc.), it is reasonable to use statistics in determining the possibilityof RISKfor the multiple conditions. Heating effect ofLEAKAGE CURRENTSA current of 10 mA will produce no sensation of heating with a typical PATIENT CONNECTIONwith acontact area of theorder of1cm2, buta currenta few times higher than thiswouldproduce a burn. The RISKofa burn depends onthemagnitude ofthe current but not on itsfrequency, sothe current hasto be measured with a non-frequency-weighted device, such asa device similar to that shown in Figure 12 a)but without C1 and R1. Subclause 8.7.4.2 – Measuring supplycircuitsFor correct results of LEAKAGE CURRENT measurements, it isessential to haveacommon reference point within the measuring circuit. The point also hasto be electrically referenced toall parts of the circuit. Also the measuredLEAKAGE CURRENT could be different accordingtotheparticular supply configuration. For example, ifMEEQUIPMENT that isspecified forconnectionto a supply having oneside at earth potential isconnected instead to a supply having two symmetrical phases (such as a 230V supply in theUSA) the measuredLEAKAGE CURRENT will be much lower thanthe worst case. If the installed SUPPLY MAINS of the room where themeasurements are made does not represent the worst case, a specific supply circuit has to be established. This can be done by using an isolating transformer with the appropriate point inthe SECONDARY CIRCUIT connectedto thereference point. Accurate and reproducible resultswhen makingLEAKAGE CURRENT measurementscan alsobeobtained without an isolatingtransformer. However thiswould depend on the quality of the SUPPLY MAINS used for the measurements. Factors thatneedto beconsideredwould include transients, interference signalsand voltage differencesbetween neutral and earthin the measuring circuit. The earth symbols in thefigures represent this common reference point, whichis not connected to the protective earthof theSUPPLY MAINS. Such a separate reference point canprovide additional protection for the personcarryingout themeasurements. A variable-voltage transformer isnecessary toprovide 110 % of theRATED supply voltage tothe MEEQUIPMENT. Althoughit would be possible to test withthe MAINS VOLTAGE normallypresent in the testroom and to multiply the measuredLEAKAGE CURRENT values by the appropriate factor, this would not always producethe same result astesting with 110 % oftheRATED supply voltage, particularly withMEEQUIPMENT that includes a switched-mode powersupply. The switchesS1 or S1 + S2 orS1 + S2 + S3inFigure F.1to Figure F.4 (inclusive) can beomittedand the interruptions ofthe relevant leads can beobtained byother means. Instead ofthe single or polyphaseisolatingtransformers with adjustable output voltage(s),as shown in Figure F.1 to Figure F.5 (inclusive), a combination of an isolating transformer with set output voltageandan auto-transformer with adjustableoutput voltagecanbe used.

The advice in the note in8.7.4.3 d)1) istherefore to beconsidered asa convention.The fact thatPATIENT cables can havea significant capacitance to earth is usually importantand of considerableinfluence ontest results. A position providing reproducible resultsistherefore prescribed. The isolation transformer in the measuring supplycircuit providesadditional protection for theperson making the measurements and increases the accuracy of the LEAKAGE CURRENTmeasurements. However, it is not absolutely necessaryto usean isolating transformerwhen making LEAKAGE CURRENT measurements. Insome cases, such as high input powerMEEQUIPMENT and ME SYSTEMS, use ofan insolating transformer is not feasible. When makingLEAKAGE CUURENT measurement without an isolating transformer, the MANUFACTURER needs toconsider the following:– isit possible to extrapolate theLEAKAGE CURRENTS at 110 % of the RATED supply voltage; – the influenceofcurrents thatare driven by voltagedifferences between theprotectiveearth and the mains supply neutral of ME EQUIPMENT or for ME SYSTEMS withmultiplePROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTIONS. Measuring withoutan isolation transformer can produceLEAKAGE CURRENT readingsthat are greater than the LEAKAGE CURRENTmeasurement with an isolating transformer.Subclause 8.7.4.5 – Measurement of EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENTThemeasuring device represents ameasuring method that takesintoaccount thephysiological effect of a current through thehumanbody, including the heart, as well as thepossibilityof a low impedance contact between a PATIENT CONNECTION and thePATIENT. Although IEC60990[20] specifiessome measuring devicesfor generaluse,noneof thesewouldbe appropriate for measuringPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT. As themeasuring device of thesecond edition is being retained for thatpurpose, it is most convenient to use the same device for all LEAKAGE CURRENT measurements, apart from themeasurement of currentsor currentcomponents with frequencies exceeding1kHz in relation to the10mA limit specified in 8.7.3 d).

The assumptionmade in this thirdedition is that, if the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS place no restrictionsonwhatother equipment isallowed to be connected to theSIGNAL INPUT/OUTPUT PART, the presence of the MAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGEshould be regarded asa NORMAL CONDITION. Instead of an isolating transformer T2 with anadjustable output voltage, acombination of anisolatingtransformer with a set outputvoltage and an auto-transformer with an adjustableoutput voltage can beused. Subclause 8.7.4.7 d)The testwith an external voltage applied to unearthed metal ACCESSIBLE PARTS reflects the requirement in 8.5.2.2 for isolation betweensuch partsand unearthed PATIENT CONNECTIONSof TYPE B APPLIED PARTS. For TYPE BF APPLIED PARTS this testapplies as well as the test of 8.7.4.7 b), eventhoughboth test the isolation between the PATIENT CONNECTIONS and other parts, because the PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT might not be the same in these two situationsand different limit valuesapply. Instead of an isolating transformer T2 with anadjustable output voltage, acombination of anisolatingtransformer with a set outputvoltage and an auto-transformer with an adjustableoutput voltage can beused. Careshould be taken that the capacitanceof the measuringdeviceand itsconnecting leads to earth and to the body of the MEEQUIPMENT is kept aslow as possible.As explained in the rationale to8.7.3, the presence of the MAXIMUM MAINSVOLTAGE on aPATIENTrepresentsaworst case, this ismoresevere than islikely toarise in practice, and the allowable PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT for a TYPE BF APPLIED PART in thissituation is 5 mA. It was pointed out thatthe application of MAINS VOLTAGE to anunearthedACCESSIBLE PART could therefore causeaPATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT of up to5mA to flow from the PATIENTCONNECTIONS of aTYPE BF APPLIED PART; whereas in the same situation a TYPE B APPLIED PART(whichin general offers a lower level of safety) was allowedonly 500 μA. In order toresolve this anomaly, thetest of 8.7.4.7d), with 110% ofthe MAXIMUM MAINS VOLTAGE onunearthedACCESSIBLE PARTS, also applies to TYPE BF APPLIED PARTS, and in thiscondition theallowablePATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT is the general 500μA value for SINGLE FAULT CONDITION.

If this iswithin thePATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTlimit it will certainly be withinthe total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT limit. However it ispossible to haveTYPE B APPLIED PARTSthat arenot directly earthed, and in that case the measuredvaluescan be different.Subclause 8.7.4.9 – MEEQUIPMENT with multiplePATIENT CONNECTIONSThisrequirement was introduced in the second amendment to thesecond edition of thisstandard. It addresses aRISK thatcan arise, for example, with equipment for measuring physiological signals where an amplifier drives oneelectrode toreduce common-mode interference. If one of thesensingelectrodes isdisconnected from thePATIENT and picks up a large voltage at mains frequency, the amplifier could drive a large currentintothe PATIENT in a vain attempt tocancel the interference.The requirement represents a compromisebetween requiring extensivetesting, which withmostMEEQUIPMENT wouldyield no usefulinformation, and having no specific requirement to address this RISK.  Subsequently IEC60601-2-49:2001 [16] introduced acomprehensive set of tests, tobe performedon all equipmentwithin thescope of thatstandard. Theseinclude measurement ofwhat istermed “PART LEAKAGE CURRENT” in that standard: this is the current flowing between the PATIENT CONNECTIONS of one function and the PATIENT CONNECTIONS of other function(s), which iscovered in this edition of the general standard by therevised definition ofPATIENTAUXILIARY CURRENT. Considerationwasgiven to incorporating these tests in thisgeneral standard, but it was decidedthatsuch specific testing should beleft to particular standards. The scenarios to whichthey relate, suchas havingthePATIENT CONNECTIONS of one function in use and connected to thePATIENT while the PATIENT CONNECTIONSof another function arenot inuse and could make contact with earth or other objects,are likely to arise with multifunctionPATIENT monitoring equipment but unlikely with mostother kindsofMEEQUIPMENT. Figure A.15, based onFigure KK.101of IEC60601-2-49:2001[16], shows an exampleofmeasuring the PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT from one function of a TYPE BF APPLIED PART while the PATIENT CONNECTIONS of another function of the sameAPPLIED PART and of twoTYPE CF APPLIED PARTS areeither floatingor earthed.Subclause 8.8.1 – General Care should be taken that the voltage applied toa REINFORCEDINSULATION does notoverstresseither of the MEANS OF PROTECTION in the MEEQUIPMENT.

Theyshould not be onerous inpractice forMEEQUIPMENT, and indeed mostMEEQUIPMENT designedaccording to thepreviouseditionsof thisstandardwould have satisfied them. The requirementsthat have beenintroduced are intendedto betechnically equivalent tothoseofIEC 60950-1, but the editorial structure has been changed for clarity, asfollows.– IEC60950-1 specifies a general requirement for distance throughinsulation, with an exception for voltagesup to71V. This hasbeenchanged to stateexplicitly that the requirement applies above 71 V. – IEC60950-1 specifiesan exceptionfrom therequirement for distance throughinsulationwhere the requirements for thin sheet materialapply, asset out inanothersubclause, butthatsubclause does not refer explicitly to the 71V limit. Thishas been made explicit bystating the requirements for thin sheetmaterial as an alternative to the thicknessrequirement, under the sameintroductory wording.– IEC60950-1 specifies that “Insulation in thinsheet materialsispermitted. . provided that”certainconditions aresatisfied. Thishasbeen changed to anexplicit requirement thatinsulation in thin sheet materialsneeds to satisfy these conditions. – IEC60950-1 requires that insulation in thinsheet materials “isusedwithin the equipmentENCLOSURE”. However the ENCLOSUREas defined inthis standardincludes all outer surfaces, including the surfacesof cables, APPLIED PARTS, etc. The requirement hastherefore been rephrased. Elsewhere in thisstandard the termsSUPPLEMENTARY INSULATION and REINFORCED INSULATIONhave mostly been replaced by references to MEANS OF PROTECTION, but they have beenretained here because, as in IEC60950-1, the requirementsconcerning distance throughinsulation and the use of thinsheet material apply toSUPPLEMENTARY INSULATION and toREINFORCED INSULATION,but not to BASIC INSULATION. Thus theserequirements donot applywhere BASIC INSULATION,as oneMEANS OF PROTECTION,isused in conjunction witha PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION as the other MEANS OF PROTECTION. WhereDOUBLE INSULATIONisused, these requirementsapply to whichever constituent part thereof isregarded as the SUPPLEMENTARY INSULATION. Subclause 8.8.3 – Dielectric strength Components designed to limit the voltage might need tobe removedinorder to allowthe full test voltage to be applied to the insulation being tested. The purpose ofthistest isto check all solid insulationunder the worst-case condition afterhavingachieved operating temperature. Forheating elements, the worst caseis achieved with heaters remaining energizedduring measurement. The test voltagesspecified are appropriate forsolid insulationonly. Spacings(CREEPAGEDISTANCES and CLEARANCES) areevaluated by 8.9. IEC60664-1 givesdetailsof electrical testmethods for clearances using impulse voltage dielectric strength tests. These testscan be used underthe IEC60950-1 route forMOOPs, but arenot specified forMOPPs. IEC60664-1states that the 2U+1 000V type of dielectric strength test“is not relevant for the testingofclearances”.Since the dielectricstrength test is applied immediately after the humidity preconditioningtreatment, with the MEEQUIPMENTstill in the humidity cabinet, adequateprecautions for the protection oflaboratory personnel couldbe necessary.

In SECONDARY CIRCUITS, the transient overvoltagelevel isat least one level less than the  mains circuits.–The value of test voltage is primarily determined by the transient voltage on the SUPPLYMAINS which is usually orders of magnitude largerthanthe WORKING VOLTAGE. In orderto align with the second edition ofIEC 60601-1forthe commonWORKING VOLTAGE of 220 V r.m.s to 240 V r.m.s. the test voltage of 4000 V r.m.s. was retained even though thisvalue is more that twice thetestvoltage for one MOPP. However, each individual MOPP has tomeet the 1 500 Vr.m.s. minimum requirement. Subclause 8.8.3 a)The test voltagecan be provided by a transformer, bya d.c. powersource orby using thetransformer(s) of the MEEQUIPMENT. In the last case, toprevent overheating, the test voltage canhavea frequency that ishigher than theRATED frequency of the MEEQUIPMENT. The PROCEDURE and duration ofthe testforWORKING VOLTAGE equal to or higher than 1000V a.c.or 1 500 V d.c. or peakvalues canbe specifiedfurther by particular standards.Subclause 8.8.4.1 – Mechanical strength and resistance to heatTests concerning flammability of materials will be found in IEC 60695-11-10. Subclause 8.9 – CREEPAGE DISTANCES andAIR CLEARANCESFor MEEQUIPMENTintended tobesupplied from theSUPPLY MAINS, AIR CLEARANCE anddielectricstrength requirements are based on the expectedovervoltage transients that couldenter theequipment from theSUPPLY MAINS. According to IEC60664-1, themagnitudeofthese transients isdeterminedby the normal supply voltageand thesupply arrangements. These transients are categorized according to IEC60664-1 into fourgroupscalledovervoltage categoriesI to IV (also knownas installationcategoriesI to IV). Elsewhere in thisstandard overvoltage category II is assumed. The design of solid insulation and AIR CLEARANCES should be co-ordinated in such a way that, if an incident overvoltage transient exceeds the limitsof overvoltage category II, the solid insulationcanwithstanda higher voltage than the AIR CLEARANCES. The valuesin Table13 to Table 15 correspond to those of IEC60950-1 forovervoltage category II for MAINS PARTSand overvoltage category I for SECONDARY CIRCUITS. IfMEEQUIPMENT is intended to be used in locations where theSUPPLY MAINS is in overvoltage category III or IV, these values will be inadequate. A SECONDARY CIRCUIT derived from a SUPPLY MAINSwill normally be overvoltage category I if the SUPPLY MAINSis overvoltage category II; the maximum transients for variousSUPPLYMAINS voltages inovervoltagecategoryI are shown in thecolumnheadingsof Table 13. For insulation between theENCLOSURE and the PATIENT CONNECTION of an F-TYPEAPPLIED PARTspecial rules apply: BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 263 – 1) In the case of an F-TYPEAPPLIED PART containing no voltage difference, the insulationbetween thePATIENT CONNECTIONS and the ENCLOSURE will only be stressed to the MAINSVOLTAGE in thecase ofa fault in otherequipment connected to thePATIENT. This condition rarely occurs; furthermore this insulation isnot normally subject to thetransient overvoltages found in the MAINS PART. In view of the above, the insulation necessary between the APPLIED PART and the ENCLOSURE for thecase quoted, need only satisfy the requirements for BASIC INSULATION. 2) In thecase of anF-TYPE APPLIED PARTcontaining partswith voltage difference, theconnection ofaPATIENT CONNECTION to earth via an earthedPATIENT (NORMAL CONDITION) could subject the insulation between other partsand the ENCLOSURE to the whole of thevoltage withinthe APPLIED PART. Since this voltageappears inNORMAL CONDITION, even though infrequently, the relevant insulation should satisfy the requirementsforDOUBLE INSULATION or REINFORCED INSULATION. In view of the low probability of this condition occurring, the CREEPAGE DISTANCES and AIR CLEARANCES given in Table11 are considered adequate. 3)The value to be applied is the highest of thevalues found according to Items 1) and 2)above. In the absenceof a theoretical background to refer to, it was decided that the values above1000V would be drawnfrom Table 7 of IEC61010-1:2001[22] forCREEPAGE DISTANCES usingthe columnfor material group IIIa-b, pollution degree 3, which correlates with the existingvalues in the second edition of IEC60601-1 or isslightly moreonerous. ForAIR CLEARANCES, the valueshavebeen estimated basedon therelationshipbetween creepage andclearancefor values below 1000V r.m.s. from Table12. These derived values areshown inTable A.1.Table 16of thesecond editionof IEC60601-1 wassplit into two tables in thisstandard(Tables 9and10).To align it with tablesderived from other standardssuchas IEC60950-1,the factor between the a.c. voltages and the d.c. voltages was changed from 1,2 to about 1,4.

Theserequirements have been included in8.9 rather than 8.8 because theyspecify circumstances thatallow exemptionfrom the requirements forCREEPAGE DISTANCES and AIR CLEARANCES,rather than additional requirementsapplying to solid insulation. Subclause 8.9.4 – Measurement ofCREEPAGE DISTANCESAND AIR CLEARANCESNarrow gaps, running inthe direction of apossible creepage path and being some tenths of1mm wide only, should beavoided asfaras possible,for dirtand moisture can deposit there.Subclauses 8.10.1 –Fixingof componentsIn many casesit will be obviousthat components and wiringare adequately secured (e.g. small components solderedto aprinted circuit board) without the needfor specificjustification in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE; but if any relevant information is included intheRISK MANAGEMENT FILE, it should be taken into account in assessing compliance with these requirements.

Subclause8.10.7 – Insulationof internalwiringConductors can be routed in separated jacketed cords of adequate rating. Where conductors of different circuit categories have toberun throughcommon cords,wiring channels, conduits or connecting devices, adequate separationis realized by sufficient rating ofthe conductor insulation and by arrangingfor sufficient AIR CLEARANCES andCREEPAGE DISTANCES, complyingwiththe requirements of8.9, between conductive parts in connecting devices.Subclause 8.11.1 – Isolation from the SUPPLY MAINSSubclause 8.11.1a)Skilled persons, suchasSERVICE PERSONNEL, who need to gainaccess to internal, possibly hazardous, MEEQUIPMENT parts, needa means by which theMEEQUIPMENT can be isolatedfrom the SUPPLY MAINS. A mains isolating switch, where provided, could also serve as a functional off switch for routineuse orfor disabling hazardousoutput in an emergency. Howeverit does not necessarily servethese purposes, nor doesthis standard specify any general requirementforan emergency off switch. Subclause 8.11.1c)Inthe second edition ofthis standard,the requirement forminimum contact spacing ofswitchesused to provide isolation from theSUPPLY MAINS wasspecified in IEC Publication328. IEC 61058-1superseded IEC 328 in 1990. The first edition of IEC 61058-1 required 3mm contact spacing for full disconnection from the SUPPLY MAINS. No mention of overvoltage category was made. Thethird edition ofIEC 61058-1 introducedthe concept of overvoltagecategoryaccording to IEC60664-1. Fora 230 V SUPPLY MAINSin overvoltage category II,Table 22of IEC61058-1 allows a minimum contact spacing of 1,5mm. While the requirementsin thisstandard generally relate to overvoltage category II (see8.9.1.11), it was thoughtprudent to staywith the 3mm requirement associated with a 230V SUPPLY MAINS IN overvoltage category III for all switchesintended to provide isolationfromtheSUPPLY MAINS. Not only is thisconsistentwith therequirement of the secondedition ofIEC 60601-1 but it isalsoharmoniouswiththerequirementsofIEC 60065 and IEC 60950-1, which both require aminimum contact separation of 3 mm for switches intended to provide isolation from the SUPPLYMAINS.

Thesecondedition of IEC60601-1 included the wording “Guards which fail theabovedimensional test shall have to pass the testdescribed inIEC60335-1,Amendment 6. 1988, subclause25.10.” This alternative hasbeen retained, but thereference isnow toalateredition ofIEC60335-1. Also the requirement to perform one test in all cases, and then to perform theother test if the MEEQUIPMENT fails the first test, has beenchanged to allow either test to beperformed first, because this makes no differenceto whether theMEEQUIPMENT complies.

Reliableconnection can bemade bymeans of screws, nuts, soldering, clamping, crimpingof conductors or equally effective methods.Useof terminalsofcomponents other than terminalblocksas terminals intended forexternalconductors is allowed in special cases wherethe terminal arrangement is adequate (accessible andclearly marked) andcomplying with thisstandard. The wiring terminalsofcertaintypes of components are often ratedfor field wiring purposes. Theseincludefuseholders,EMCfilters, circuit breakers, contactors, wiring strips, motor controllersand phase detectors. Each of these can beone of the first connectedcomponents thereby putting them ina goodposition to accept the first wiringconnections. Subclause 8.11.4.2 – Arrangement of MAINS TERMINAL DEVICESSubclause 8.11.4.2 a)One naturallyexpects to see all the terminals for connection of external cords orPOWERSUPPLY CORDSgrouped together.

Subclause 8.11.4.4 – Connections to mains terminals The term “special preparationof the conductor”coverssolderingof thestrands, use of cordlugs, attachment of eyelets, etc., by SERVICE PERSONNEL (i.e. in the field), but not the reshapingof theconductorbefore its introduction into the terminal or the twistingofastranded conductorto consolidatethe end. When preparation oftheconductoris performed by the MANUFACTURERand the flexiblecord isprovided as the only acceptablereplacementpart, such part isconsidered to comply withthis requirement.Subclause 8.11.5– Mains fusesand OVER-CURRENT RELEASESProvisionof fuses orOVER-CURRENT RELEASES inMEEQUIPMENT reduces theRISK that a fault inthe MEEQUIPMENTwill causea protective device in the installation tooperate, thus removingthe supply of power to other MEEQUIPMENT, possibly including life-support MEEQUIPMENT. It isobviousthat fusing in a PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION would be inappropriate. Fusing ofthe neutral conductor of PERMANENTLY INSTALLED MEEQUIPMENT would serveno purposeand, with 3-phase equipment, might lead to overstressingof insulation in theevent that such afuse were to operate while theline connections remainedintact. However anOVER-CURRENT RELEASE that interrupts all poles, including the neutral, simultaneously isacceptable. The exemptionfor the case whereDOUBLE INSULATION or REINFORCED INSULATION is present betweenall parts ofopposite polarity within the MAINS PART wassupported by the National Committees’ responsesto an inquiry during the preparation of this edition. It could applywhere provision of a fuse orOVER-CURRENT RELEASE would be inconvenient, for example in a small plug-in powersupply.

Requirements describingHAZARDS caused bydamage or deterioration ofMEEQUIPMENT (mechanical strength) havebeen collected into 15.3. MEEQUIPMENTcan become unsafe becauseof partsdamagedor deteriorated bymechanicalstresses such as blows, pressures, shocks, vibration, by ingress of solid particles, dust, fluids and moisture and aggressive gases, bythermal and dynamic stresses, by corrosion,by loosening offastenings of a moving part ora suspendedmass, and by radiation. Effects ofmechanical overloads, material failure orwear can be avoided by: – means that interruptor rendernon-hazardous theoperation or theenergysupply (forexample,fuses, pressure-relief valves) assoonas overloadingoccurs; or– means thatguard against orcatch flyingor fallingparts (caused by material failures, wearor overload) that could constitute a HAZARD. Protection against breakdown ofPATIENT supportsand suspensions can be provided byredundancy or the provision of safetycatches. MEEQUIPMENT parts that are intended to beheld in thehandor positioned onabed need to be sufficiently robust to withstand afall. They canbe subject tovibration and shocks, not only when transported but alsowhen used in vehicles. Subclause 9.2 – HAZARDS associatedwith moving partsOPERATORS, PATIENTS and other people needto be protectedfrom MECHANICAL HAZARDS. Thiscanbe achieved ina number ofways, for example:– by providing sufficient distancebetweenpeopleandHAZARDS; – byrestricting access toareas thatpresent HAZARDS; – by providing abarrier, whethermechanical or non-mechanical, between people andHAZARDS; –by reducing the RISK associated withHAZARDS; – byensuringadequateOPERATOR control over the movements causing a HAZARD; or –by providing back-up systems so that an acceptable RESIDUALRISK is achievedwhen theinitial control system fails.Whenreference ismade, in thissubclause, to theRISK to persons, rather than to the PATIENTor OPERATOR, it shouldbe noted, that therecan beotherpeople, inaddition to the PATIENT or OPERATOR in the vicinity of MEEQUIPMENT.

Depending onthe application, and thelevel of RESIDUALRISK,it could beimportant to place awarning on the product. It might, however, be acceptable to place the warning only in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. Subclause 9.2.2.4 – GUARDSand protective measuresThe degreeof protection required for ENCLOSURES or GUARDS protectingmoving parts dependsupon the general design andINTENDED USE of the MEEQUIPMENT. Factors tobe taken intoconsideration in judging the acceptability of exposed moving parts include the degree ofexposure, the shape of the moving parts, the probability ofoccurrence ofaccidental contact, the speed ofmovement andthe probability of occurrence thatfingers,arms or clothing will be drawninto movingparts (for examplewhere gearsmesh, wherebelts travel onto apulleyorwheremovingparts closeina pinching or shearing action).These factors can be considered with respect tobothNORMAL USE and the settingof any adjustments, or the replacement of any ACCESSORY or attachment, possibly including theinstallation, because GUARDS can beprovided atinstallation and might not be partofa singleitem of STATIONARYequipment. Features of GUARDSthat can be considered include: –removable with the use ofTOOLS only; –removable for servicing and replacement; – strength and rigidity; – completeness;– creation of additional HAZARDS such aspinch points, and the necessity foradditional handlingbecause ofthe increased needfor servicing such as for cleaning. Protective measures addressed bythis clause arealso intended to includecollisiondetectionsystems, such asthose employing light barriers.Protective measures can be used inlieuofcontinuousactivation type control. The protectivemeasuresneed to provide feedback control. Subclause 9.2.2.5 – Continuous activation Motion control systems withtheOPERATOR in the feedback loopneed to employcontinuousactivation(e.g. momentary contact, dead-manswitch). Such factors asspeed of motionand visible feedback to theOPERATORalso need tobe adequate. In some circumstances,OPERATOR trainingand otherqualificationsare necessary inorder tohave adequateOPERATORcontrol. In such cases,it could bedesirable to utilize“lockout controls” that require intentional action toallowmovement. Examples ofsuchcontrols include:– a key switch with an “enable”function; – a finger print switchwithan“enable” function; – a password card.

Protective measures can include anENCLOSURE, barrier, orelectronic means (e.g. redundant meansto prevent lithium battery charging current).Subclause 9.6.1 – General Excessive noisecancause fatigue, interferencewithspeech and acousticsignals, oreven damage tohearing. Limits to preventhearingdamagearedescribed in ISOstandards. In medically used rooms, much lower limits areneeded for thecomfort ofPATIENTS andmedical personnel. The actualeffect ofMEEQUIPMENT noise isstrongly influenced by the acoustical properties ofthe room, theinsulation between rooms and interaction ofMEEQUIPMENT parts. Excessive vibration will cause discomfort to the PATIENT, OPERATOR, and other persons. Prolongedexposurecan cause vascular,neurological, orosteo-articulardisorders. Excessivevibrationcan alsocause damage to MEEQUIPMENTor a shift in calibration. Most MEEQUIPMENTcovered by this standard exposes the PATIENT and OPERATOR or other persons to negligiblelevels of noise and vibration. The RISK MANAGEMENTPROCESS should be able toclearly identify thosecaseswhere measurements arerequired. Subclause 9.6.2 – Acoustic energyThese values are based on the potential for long term hearing impairment. The value usually used for regulatory purposesworldwide iscurrently 90dBA with an offset of 5dBA. However thelatest research indicates a value of85dBAfor 8 h over a 24 h period with an offsetof3 dBA when the time doubles or halves[34]. Although the criteria for judging whethera noise isconsidered impact noise is intentionally not provided, judgement should be usedreferring to the situation. Examples of impact noiseinclude:the gradient noiseof MRI equipment, and lithotripsy impulses. Subclause 9.6.3 – Hand-transmitted vibration Thresholdvaluesforvibration are much less clear thanthosefor acoustic energy (noise).Thevalue usedhereis from theDirective oftheEuropean Parliament and ofthe Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workersto the risks arising from physical agents (vibration)(sixteenth individual Directive within the meaning ofArticle16(1) ofDirective 89/391/EEC). It corresponds toabouta10% incidence ofblanching(indicative of neurological damage) after 8 years of regular exposure according to ISO 5349-1.

HAZARDSa) Mechanical rupture orbreakage (HARM: lacerations, puncture wounds)The requirementsfrom Clause 45 ofthe second editiondealing with thisHAZARD, havebeenmoved tothis subclause, and remain unchanged. Requirementshave beenclarified to indicate that all parts have a MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLEWORKING PRESSUREnot less thanthe pressure inNORMAL CONDITION orSINGLE FAULT CONDITION. Inprincipal there shouldbe a suitable safety factor betweentheMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKINGPRESSUREandthe bursting pressure, where the burstingpressure is the pressure at which a part suffers frompermanent (plastic) deformation orleakage.Industry standardsfor pressurepartsvary, but suitable safety factors are 3×, 4 ×, andsometimes 5 ×(ISO, ASME, SAE). As asuitable safety factorcan vary, depending onfactors associatedwith the end-use application and RISK, it was considered inappropriate to specify a minimum safety factor in the definition of MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKINGPRESSURE, but instead leave this to thedeclarationof theMANUFACTURERof such part. It isassumed thatMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKINGPRESSURE declarations will be basedon recognized international or nationalstandards,and therefore belowbursting pressuresat least in line with the multiplication factorshown in Figure 32, (3 ×,derated after 1MPa toas low as1,3× after 30MPa). For pressure vessels exceeding both an energy limit (pressure×volume) and amaximumpressure limit, the requirement isto conduct a hydrostatic overpressure testbased ontheMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WORKING PRESSURE declaration and the multiplication factorshown inFigure 32, (3×, derated after 1MPa toas low as 1,3× after 30MPa). b) Mechanical loss of support (HARM: crush, puncturewounds)Requirements have beenclarified tospecify thatcomponents in a pressure system, suchasthosein a hydrauliclift system whoseintegrity is relied onto reduce the RISK from lossof support needto comply withtheNORMAL CONDITIONTENSILE SAFETY FACTORS specified in 9.8.

Subclause 9.7.5 – Pressure vesselsIt isassumed that ahydraulic test is notnecessaryif the pressure is less than or equal to 50 kPaor the product ofthepressure and volume isless thanor equal to200kPa⋅⋅ l. The safety factors implied by Figure32 are higherthanthose generally applied intesting pressure vessels. However, whereas hydraulic testing is normally used to verify that apressure vessel is freefromproduction faults orseriousdeterioration, theadequacy of the designbeingdetermined in other ways, the present hydraulic test is intended to verify theadequacy of a designwhere thiscannotbe established in other ways. Thedeletionof national references in the amended text avoidssubordinating the requirements ofthe standard to those oflocal regulations. TheMEEQUIPMENT will sometimes have to satisfy both, or themore demanding, assuming thatthere are no local regulations thatconflict with this standard.A hydraulic test isspecified even forpneumatic vessels,as thisissafer for the tester. Inachieving the testpressure with a gas, the gaswill compress, resulting inmorestored energy in the test vessel thanwoulda hydraulic test method. Bothmethodsresult in the same testpressure, which is the objective of the test. Subclause 9.8 – HAZARDSassociated with support systems The term “support” is taken to include “suspension”and loads can includePATIENTS, OPERATORS and othermasses. Support systemscan broadly becategorized as follows.–A suspension system is one that contains flexing or rigid elements that are designed tosuspend masses, including PATIENTS and OPERATORS duringNORMAL USE. – Flexing elementsinclude ropes, cables, chains, belts, bands and springs. Additionally ajackscrewnut is consideredimpairedby wear to the extent needinga higherTENSILE SAFETY FACTOR. – An actuating system is one that contains elements such as electric, pneumatic or hydraulic actuators, motors, gearboxes, shafts, bearings, pulleys, sheaves,band wheels andguides.

TENSILE SAFETY FACTORS are applied toprovide amarginofsafety to thedesign afterall reasonable allowances for operating conditions, material and manufacturing variables, etc., have been made. In determiningwhethercase A or B is to beused from Table 21, certainty of material strengthisrequiredin order to apply case A values. Additionally thereneeds to beconfidence in thedetermination of TOTAL LOAD in order to apply case A values. TOTAL LOAD isconstituted from “staticforce” and “dynamicforce” components.The static force isnormally clear.But the dynamic force/loading is sometimesuncertain.When the dynamic forcesareknown aswell as static forces, the TENSILE SAFETY FACTOR is determinedwithcase A. When thedynamic forces are not clear, and the staticforces are known, the TENSILE SAFETY FACTORis determined with case B. External forces for PATIENTsupports can includethose generated by application of CPR, etc. Elongation at break of 5% is based on historical experiencewith metallic materials, in particularsteel and cast iron. Materials with elongation at break less than 5 % are consideredbrittle and their failure is likely catastrophic, and therefore a highersafety factor isconsidered appropriate.  For non-metallicmaterials:– Where noother experience exists, and where failure modeis likely catastrophic, thiselongation factor isconsidered appropriate, and therefore ahigherTENSILE SAFETY FACTORis consideredappropriate. – Where experience and testing show otherwise, an elongation at break oflessthan 5% canbe appropriate before ahigherTENSILE SAFETY FACTOR is justified. For example, PATIENT tables of X-ray/CT/MRsystemsareoften designed with plasticmaterials laminated or reinforcedby carbon fibres/cloths orglass fibres/cloths, since thesePATIENTtables must be optimisedforlow absorption of X-ray radiation (aluminium equivalence), MR compatibility(low proton signal), as wellas structuralstability. Although these plastic materials reinforcedby carbon fibres/cloths canhave elongation at breakof less than 5 %,many years knowledge, acquiredexpertise, andpost-market surveillancecan providesufficient evidence that suitable structural stability of PATIENTtables is achieved by applying aTENSILE SAFETY FACTORfrom Table 21, Situation 1 (rather than Situation 2).At end of life or periodic maintenance cycle, MEEQUIPMENT needs to maintain structuralintegrity. Line 1 of Table 21 is normally appropriate forendof life or the end of the periodicmaintenance cycle since wearis nolonger considered. Suspension and actuating systems haveTENSILE SAFETYFACTORS that are necessarily high toreduce the effects ofdeterioration throughwearand fatigue.Particularattention should be given tothe fixing of structures tofloors, ceilings, etc. thatare subject to variableTENSILE SAFETY FACTORS. A hiddendefect is one that is not revealed during manufacture, service or normaloperationofthe MEEQUIPMENTbut that could cause failure of a part that could result in a HAZARD. Examples are high internal stresses in heat-treatedpartssuch assprings, brokenstrands ofwireinside cables and porosity inside castings.

For a particular design, these TENSILE SAFETY FACTORS and design/test loads can vary according to the materials used, their wearcharacteristics,loading conditions, etc.Thissubclause focuses onsafety factorsas the suggested approach to haveconfidence thatthe equipmentwill maintain structural integrity during its EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE. In some cases the specified safety factors are morethanneeded, and in some cases evenlargerfactors could be considered appropriate. The compliance criteria can be satisfied byRISKMANAGEMENT rather than by theuse of thesafety factorroute.For newmaterialsor forstructures with sophisticated monitoring ofstresses, the safety factors might not benecessary. If it isdeemedthat the failure mode of the part doesnot result inan unacceptable RISK, theTENSILE SAFETY FACTORS specified in Table 21 donot apply.

Thefailure ofthe primary supportmeans subject to wear is considered a SINGLE FAULT CONDITION if it has a TENSILE SAFETY FACTOR in accordance with Table 21, rows 5 and 6. To protect against HARM in thisSINGLEFAULT CONDITION, the MECHANICAL PROTECTIVE DEVICE acts as a backup,and needsto havethe TENSILE SAFETY FACTOR indicated in Table21, Row7.

For ionizing radiation IEC requirements generally comply withthe International CommissionforRadiation Protection (ICRP)Recommendations. Their purpose is toprovide data thatareimmediately usable bydesignerandRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION. Their evaluation ispossible only by adequatestudyof operating methods and duration ofoperation ofMEEQUIPMENT and positioning ofOPERATOR and assistants, because applicationof worst case conditions would give riseto situationsthat might hamper proper diagnosisor treatment. Recent ICRP publicationsalso instruct the OPERATOR in methods for the restriction of intentional irradiation. Subclause10.1.1 – ME EQUIPMENT not intended to produce diagnostic or therapeuticX-radiation Spurious X-radiationfrom components such as Video Display Units (VDU) is a potential source of concern for ME EQUIPMENT, many of which contain VDUs. Annex H of IEC60950-1:2001 contains a well-acceptedPROCEDURE for measuringsuch spurious emissions for information technology equipment. The limits in that annex are basedon ICRP60[39]. The requirements from Annex H of IEC60950-1:2001 were incorporated into the bodyof thisstandard because this was the only normative reference thatrequired the use of IEC60950-1.Othernormativereferences to IEC 60950-1are alternative means ofaddressingitemssuch asCREEPAGE DISTANCE and AIR CLEARANCE.

It is not intended that the MEEQUIPMENTparts be tested inevery possible configuration of NORMAL USE as longas theMANUFACTURER candetermine the worst-case conditions. The“worst case” will almost alwaysinclude the highest allowable ambient temperature and operation of the MEEQUIPMENT at the maximumDUTY CYCLE, but other specific aspects of theconfiguration of the MEEQUIPMENT(such as attachment of ACCESSORIES) should be determined by the MANUFACTURERbased on athorough understanding of theMEEQUIPMENT'S design.Subclause 11.1.2 – Temperature of APPLIED PARTSTable23 andTable 24 addressesHAZARDSthatcould arise from human contact withhigher temperatures. Human contact temperatures were based on clinical expertise,clinical literature [52] and experimentation. In addition, the valuesagree with those of the EuropeanNorm EN563 [38]. Although the maximum surface temperature foranAPPLIED PART wasraised from 41°C to43 °Cin response to theclinical input mentioned above, input fromsomeclinicianspointedout thatinfants as well as some other (thermally) high risk groups could be more prone to HARMfrom heated surfacesat 43°C.Ideally, particular standardsforMEEQUIPMENTused for these PATIENTgroups would haverequirements for(where necessary) lowercontact temperatures. In order to address thosecaseswhere such particularstandards do notexist, theworking group felt thatnotificationofthe RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION whentemperatures exceed the second edition limit of 41°C wasadequate. However, the new43°C limit is tobeconsidered anabsolute maximum. When measuringAPPLIED PART temperatures, the method used should simulate the worst-case configuration whenpossible usingreal orsimulated human skin. Determination oftheworst-case configuration should consider aspects suchas thelikely bodytemperature and whether or not the part of the body orAPPLIED PART itself iscovered (such aswith a blanket). Simulated human skin for these purposes could include materials such as silicon rubber.

The requirements addressingfire in this standard focus on preventingtheMEEQUIPMENT from beingthe source of combustion. For this reason, these requirements focusonMEEQUIPMENTthat containsor isused in the presence of OXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTS. Theserequirements attempt toensure thatany potential sourceof ignitionremains isolated from the OXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTS underNORMAL USE and SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS. Where MEEQUIPMENT isnotused insuchenvironments, assuring that the limits foroperatingtemperatures and requirements for overloadprotectionare met shouldbeconsideredadequate.  For MEEQUIPMENT that could provide a significant source of fuel (in comparison to the normaloperating environments) additional requirementsshouldbe providedby particular standards. Where no particular standard exists, such issues should be specifically addressedin applyingthe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSas required in 4.2. Subclause 11.2.1 –Strength and rigidityrequired to prevent firein MEEQUIPMENT. At least all electrical parts thatcould result in a HAZARD, with the exception of POWER SUPPLYCORDSand other necessaryinterconnecting cords, should be enclosedinmaterialthat will not support combustion.

Reports of fires inOXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTS inMEEQUIPMENTare unusual. However, when suchfires dooccur in the hospital environment theycan have tragicconsequences. MEEQUIPMENT intended to operate in conjunction with anOXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENT should be designed tominimize the probability or occurrence of ignitionof flammable materials.Whereappropriate,particular standards should specify the corresponding requirements. Subclause 11.2.2.1 a)Cottonisregarded to be the materialwith the lowest ignition temperatureand energyin comparisonwith electroniccircuitsand it isassumed that it canbe found in theinteriorof adevice as dust.The maximum surface temperaturelimit is based on the minimum hotplate ignitiontemperature for fireretardant cotton in100% oxygen that is given inNFPA 53[41] as 310°C. The assumption was therefore madethat 300 °C was anacceptable temperaturelimit in MEEQUIPMENT withOXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTS. The worst case conditions describedinthe text makeit possibleto provide simple numbers aslimitations. The values for sparking are taken from Kohl, H.-J. et al., ASTM STP 1395 [37]. This subclause allows the use of electronic circuits inOXYGEN RICH ENVIRONMENTs only when their power supply is limited. The resistive limitationof thepower input is necessary for the SINGLE FAULT CONDITION of an open solder joint that might spark. The same reason applies tothe limitation of energy in capacitances and inductances. In most cases the limitationin item 4)to 300°C is more restrictivethanthese. For most small components like decouplingcapacitors,orwhere the failure ofa component causes the maximum possible power to bedrawn from the source, it is necessary to limit the power to about 1 W. The PROCEDURE to find the necessary value to limit thepower so that the300°C limit is not exceededcan beas follows: – look for the smallestcomponent thatcan match to thepowersourceinaSINGLE FAULT CONDITION; – estimate itsthermal resistance; – calculate the power limitation= 200 °C / thermal resistance.Subclause 11.2.2.1 b) 2) This item addressesthe conditionofan undetected oxygenleak. In accordance withthedefinition of SINGLE FAULT SAFE, such aleak (becauseit is undetected) is considered aNORMALCONDITION (see4.7). Similarly, only the failure ofthe ventilation,which isundetected, needs tobe considered a NORMAL CONDITION. Where aventilation system’s design makesit unlikely thatit willbe completely blocked in NORMAL USE, such blockages should not be considered. The only way to findthe maximum leak rate thatneeds to be consideredis to find theminimum leakratethat can safely be detected bytheRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION.

Subclause 11.3 – Constructional requirement for fire ENCLOSURES of MEEQUIPMENTThe requirements for fire ENCLOSURES from IEC 61010-1 [22] have been included primarily as analternate to the tests related to SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS (associated with combustion and its consequences listed in Clause 13). By requiring flame resistance for the ENCLOSURE and materials contained within it, the probability of occurrence of fire escaping such ENCLOSURES is consideredminimal. Where the fire ENCLOSURE constitutes only a part of the MEEQUIPMENT, careful analysis should be performedto assurethat a reliable barrier tothepropagationof fire exists. Subclause 11.4 – MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSintended for use with flammable anaestheticsWhile the use of flammable anaesthetics is uncommon, it was determined during thewriting ofthis edition thatsome MANUFACTURERS might still want to rate their MEEQUIPMENT asCATEGORY AP or CATEGORY APG. In orderto makethis edition more usable (by removing therarely used sectionon this topic)while maintaining the availability of theCATEGORY AP and CATEGORYAPGRATINGS, the material has been movedto an annex and only this clause’s brief reference to it remains inthe body of the standard.The final determination of whether MEEQUIPMENT should beRATEDCATEGORY AP or CATEGORY APGshouldbe determined by the MANUFACTURERbased on the INTENDED USE. Requirementsrelated toCATEGORY AP and CATEGORY APG are found in Annex G(seealso therationale for Annex G). Subclause 11.5 – MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSintended for use with flammable agents While it was necessary to address caseswhere MEEQUIPMENT is used with flammable agents(such as some disinfectants) orin areaswhere they arecommonly used andwhere the MANUFACTURER of the MEEQUIPMENT hasgiven no special handling instructions or precautions, the variety of such agents, their volatility as well as many other determinant factors precludes giving specific instructions. Theonly reasonable solution insuchcasesis to assure that the MANUFACTURERevaluates and addresses the associatedRISK. A mixture of the vapour ofa flammabledisinfection orcleaning agentwithaircan be treatedas aFLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH AIR subject to national or local regulations.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 286 – Subclause 11.6.2 – Overflow inMEEQUIPMENTThepurpose of this testis to assess not only whether the liquidactually wetsany partsin a way that would adversely affect aMEANS OF PROTECTION orresult in aHAZARD; but also whether a similar amount ofliquid that could overflow on another occasionand reachthesame parts of the MEEQUIPMENT, but possibly not land inexactly the same way, could adversely affect a MEANS OF PROTECTION or result in a HAZARD. The results of the test shouldbeevaluatedto assure they realistically represent conditionsthat will beexperienced when the MEEQUIPMENT isused. Subclause 11.6.3 – Spillageon MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSIn addition toMEEQUIPMENT thatrequires theuse of fluids, many types are exposed to fluid spills as part of their REASONABLY FORESEEABLE MISUSES. In such cases (as well as for MEEQUIPMENT requiring fluids) the amount and location where spillscan occur vary greatly.Only a proper evaluation of the MEEQUIPMENT being testedcan determineanappropriate application of the requirement. Doing such an evaluation is the responsibility of the MANUFACTURER and the results are to be provided to those performing the test (typically in theRISK MANAGEMENT FILE). Thisrequirementwould be an appropriatearea for evaluation bywritersof particular standards. Examination of the NORMAL USE ofMEEQUIPMENT shouldprovide anadequate estimateof theamount of fluid that islikely to bespilled on it. Spillage for equipment that doesnot require the use of fluids isconsidered to be a SINGLEFAULT CONDITION. Subclause 11.6.4 – Leakage Leakage isconsidered to beaSINGLE FAULT CONDITION. Subclause 11.6.5 – Ingress ofwater and particulate matter into MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSAlthough it is unlikely that MEEQUIPMENT wouldbeRATED for protection againstparticulatematter, IEC60529does address the possibility and it should be considered a valid option.The presence of any water or particulate matter inside theENCLOSURE after testing inaccordance with itsIEC 60529 classificationis regarded as aNORMAL CONDITION. The requirement is therefore to assess the possibility of aHAZARDOUS SITUATION due to such ingress in combination with a possible SINGLE FAULT CONDITION (such as an interruptedPROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION). Subclause 11.6.8 – Compatibilitywith substancesused with the MEEQUIPMENTMEEQUIPMENT, ACCESSORIES andpartsthereof should be designedto be used safely withthe substances with whichthey are intendedto comeinto contact inNORMAL USE.

The voltage level and duration of short interruptions are defined in Tables 210 and211 of IEC60601-1-2:2001. IEC60601-1-2 treats these short interruptionsas a NORMALCONDITION. For MEEQUIPMENT inwhich the safety of the PATIENT dependson thecontinuity of the power, particular standards shouldinclude requirements regarding powerfailure alarms or otherprecautions. Clause12– Accuracy of controlsand instrumentsand protection against hazardous outputs IEC60601-1 is theguideline forall particularstandards and, therefore,contain some requirements of amore general character in order to servethis purpose.Forthis reason, it isnecessary tohave somegenerally formulated requirementsin Clause 12. Standardization bodies,including thoseoutside IEC,haveadopted the systemofthis IEC publication in orderto have a single uniform systemof standards. In such cases it is mostimportant togive a guideline in thisclause. This clause introduces the concept ofUSABILITY. The term waschosen over the commonly used termsof “user error” or“human error” becausenot all errors are the result of oversight or carelessness on the part of the OPERATOR of theMEEQUIPMENT. All too frequently, use errors are the directresult of poorhuman interface design that seduces theOPERATOR intoanincorrectdecision. Use errors caused byinadequateUSABILITYhave becomean increasing causefor concern. TheUSABILITY ENGINEERING PROCESS described in IEC 60601-1-6 isintended to achieve reasonableUSABILITY, which in turnis intended to minimise use errorsand to minimise use associated RISKS. Subclause12.4.1 – Intentional exceeding ofsafety limitsIf the control range of MEEQUIPMENT is such that the deliveredoutput in a part of the rangeconsiderably differsfrom the output that is regarded as non-hazardous, means should be provided that prevent such a settingor that indicate to the OPERATOR (for example by meansof an apparent additional resistance whenthe control is set orthe bypassing of aninterlock)that the selected setting is in excess of a safety limit. Whereappropriate,particular standards should specify safe outputlevels. Subclause 12.4.3 – Accidental selection ofexcessive outputvaluesProtection forthe accidentalselection ofexcessive output valuescanbe obtainedbyappropriate steps to minimise the possibility to accidentally select excessive output, e.g.byinterlocks in order to achieve deliberate action orbyseparated output terminals. In considering the measuresfor protection, the standardon human factors couldbe takeninto account. Clause 13 – HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS and fault conditionsMEEQUIPMENTorits parts could resultinHAZARDS due to abnormaloperation or faultconditions, which, therefore,needs to be investigated. Whilethis clause identifies specificfault conditions, 4.7requires that theRISK ANALYSIS beused to identify other failureswhich should be investigated.

In addition to the potential forelectriccurrents to cause fibrillation(due toelectricshock), thesecurrentscan also be the rootcauseof injuriesnot directly related toelectricshock.Examples of these other HAZARDS (related to inadequate or faulty insulation or short circuitsacrossphysicalspacing used as insulation)could include sparks that could becomea source ofignition offlammable materials (as discussed in Clause 11)orfunctionalfailuresthat could cause a loss of ESENTIAL PERFORMANCE. In thesecases, compliance with the insulation requirements ofClause8 should always be consideredevidence that RISKS arising from thefailureof insulation orspacing have been adequately addressedwhen evaluating the safety ofMEEQUIPMENT. Finally, it should be notedthatthe requirementsforCREEPAGE DISTANCES and AIR CLEARNACESare not intendedto be required atthe circuit boardlevel wherethere is no significant RISK that spacings will be compromised (shorted) by contaminates (from NORMAL USE orthe manufacturingPROCESS)such as fluidsor particulate matter(seealsoIEC60529). Inmostapplications, spacing between (for example) circuit boardtracesand component leads are notconsidered likely to fail. In caseswhere there is doubtas towhetherspacingcould fail (wheretheCREEPAGE DISTANCE and AIR CLEARNACE requirements of 8.9 are not met), theMANUFACTURER’SRISK ANALYSIS should evaluate thelikelihood of shorting acrosssuch gaps, but only where such short-circuiting could directly result in unacceptableRIRKS. Where shorting acrossspacing or insulation failuresareclearly not likely to result inunacceptableRISKS, such analysis shouldnot be required. Subclause 13.1.2 – Emissions, deformation ofENCLOSURE or exceedingmaximum temperature The delivery of unintendedhazardous quantities of energy or substances to aPATIENT or intothe natural environment could beaddressed by particular standards.Hazardousquantitiesof poisonousor ignitablegas depend on the typeofgas,concentration,place of emission etc. SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS thatmight result in a small fire, but where the fire would remain contained within a fire ENCLOSURE,are acceptable because the containment will limit the effects to the area inside of the fire ENCLOSURE. At a power dissipation of less than 15W in theabsence of an increased oxygen concentration (see11.2.2), no fireHAZARDexists. Where circuits could dissipate 15 W or greater, it should be demonstrated that componentswithin such circuitswill not cause fire, molten metal, etc. topropagate in such a way asto result in aHAZARD (by settingthe surroundings onfirefor example). However,as inIEC61010-1 [22], it is consideredthat when such componentsare enclosed ina fireENCLOSURE asdefined in 11.3, adequate protection from suchpropagation isprovided. It is felt that limiting the maximum temperatures for APPLIED PARTS to the NORMAL CONDITIONvaluesis appropriatebecauseexceeding them is known toresult inHARM and the PATIENT is frequently unable to pull away.

While the short circuit or open circuit of the capacitor is a SINGLE FAULT CONDITION and locking of the rotor is also a SINGLE FAULT CONDITION (see 13.2.8) this is regarded as an instanceof the situationreferredto in 4.7, where oneSINGLE FAULT CONDITION canresult unavoidably in another SINGLE FAULT CONDITION and the two failuresareconsideredas oneSINGLE FAULTCONDITION. Subclause 13.2.10 – Additional test criteria for motor operated MEEQUIPMENT and Table26, last line Temperature limits of motor windings inMEEQUIPMENT are determined afterthefirst hour asan arithmetic average becauseexperience oftesthouses has shown thatMEEQUIPMENT fornon-CONTINUOUS OPERATION reaches variable values thatcould temporarily differ from the maximum values. Therefore,lower temperature limitsare required. The values in Table26arebased on therequirements of IEC 60950-1:2001.

Clause 14 – PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRICAL MEDICAL SYSTEMS(PEMS) Computers are increasingly usedinMEEQUIPMENT, often in safety-critical roles. The use of computing technologies increases thelevel ofcomplexity inMEEQUIPMENT. Thiscomplexity means that systematicfailures can escapethe practical limits of testing. Accordingly, thisclausegoes beyond traditional test and measurement ofthe finishedMEEQUIPMENT andincludes requirements for thePROCESSES by whichit is developed. Testing ofthe finishedproduct isnot, by itself, adequateto addressthe safety ofPROGRAMMABLEMEEQUIPMENT. For these reasons, this clause requires that a PROCESSwith specific elementsbe established and followed. The intention is toestablish these specificPROCESS elements, leaving the userof thisclause todetermine indetailhow to accomplish them. Thisissimilar to theapproachtaken in the ISO9000series.

These requirements were omitted becausethe need to repeat PROCESSESorportionsof themis unique toeach particular device. Inaddition, the need for such iteration will arise from the more detailed understanding thatemergesduring thedesign PROCESS. Because users of this standardarerequired toestablish,maintain and apply aRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSas part of compliance,this clauseestablishesthose characteristics unique toprogrammable systems that shouldbeconsideredas part of thatPROCESS. The effective application of Clause 14 will require, subject tothe task in hand, competenceinthe following: –application ofthe specificMEEQUIPMENTwith emphasison safety considerations; – MEEQUIPMENT development PROCESS; – methods by which safetyis assured;– techniquesofRISK ANALYSIS and RISK CONTROL. Requirementshave been minimized to those thatareessential to assuringBASIC SAFETY andESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. Thishasbeen done in recognition of the extensiveandgrowingliterature inthe fieldsof software assuranceand RISKASSESSMENT techniquesaswell as therapid evolution of this discipline. Subclause 14.1 – General This standard requires the application of aRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSin accordance with ISO14971. This isparticularly relevanttoPEMS, becauseof thedifficulty ofshowing the correctness ofsoftware orcomplex hardware. Therefore thedesign of aPEMS has to be performed within aRISKMANAGEMENTPROCESS, in whichRISKCONTROL measures are relatedto the RISKS being controlled. If the application of ISO14971showsthataPESS has the potentialto contribute toaHAZARDOUS SITUATION, and non-softwareRISK CONTROL measuresexternal to the PESS have not reduced theRISK toan acceptable level, Clause 14 adds extra RISK MANAGEMENT and life-cycle PROCESSES for thePEMS. Compliance VERIFICATION requires theMANUFACTURER'S internal assessmentto cover not onlythe requirements of thisclause but also those of ISO 14971. Compliance with therequirementsof Clause 14 is judgedby examining the documentation produced bythePROCESSES required in the various subclauses. Clause 14 should be appliedas a whole and not selectively. All of thisdocumentation isrequired to be in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Theconcept of assessment has been introduced in thecompliancestatement to allow for methodsother than inspectionwhere necessary, suchas audit. Thus, although there isno general requirement for theMANUFACTURER to operatea quality management system inaccordance with ISO13485[30], certain features of sucha system are necessary. One feature that iscommonly regarded asessential fora quality managementsystem to beeffective isa PROCESS of audit andreviewperformedwithin the organisation toconfirm that it is actually following its own PROCEDURES; this is separate from any externalassessment that could beperformedto demonstrate compliance with standards or regulatory requirements.This standard, therefore, requires that theMANUFACTURER not only document certain aspects of the designPROCESS but also carry out an assessment to confirm that the requirements ofthis clause have beenfollowed.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 291 – Subclause 14.2 – Documentation The expected way by which compliance withPROCESS requirementscan be determined is byassuring that the documentation required for eachPROCESS step has been generated. Whilemost of the requirements of ISO 14971 are crucial components of an adequate software life-cycle, Clause 14 containsmany additional PROCESSsteps not required by thatstandard. Therefore, thedocumentation that these additional PROCESSsteps (in Clause 14) require isnecessary for a certification body to determine that the PROCESS stepshave been performed. Because Clause 14 addresses those RISKS associated withPEMS, thisdocumentation isrequired tobe included in theRISK MANAGEMENT FILE. Since compliance with Clause 14is determined byinspection and assessment to assurethattherequired documentation hasbeen generated, thequality andaccuracy of these documents is important.Because demonstration of the safety of aPEMS depends ondocumentation, aneffectivesystem is needed toensure the integrity of the documentation and, if differentversions of a document exist, to identify the applicability of each version. Therefore it isrequired that the documentsbe generated, revisedandmaintainedunder a formaldocumentcontrol system.MANUFACTURERSshould assure that this documentation isclear and comprehensive to assist in the assessment PROCESS. Subclause 14.3 – RISK MANAGEMENT planISO 14971 requiresthat aRISK MANAGEMENT planbe prepared and maintainedin theRISK MANAGEMENT FILE. In addition to elements of the RISK MANAGEMENT plan requiredby ISO14971, aPEMSVALIDATION plan is required becausevalidationis seen as a necessary activity when developing a PEMS. Subclause 14.4 – PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLEA documented life-cycle helps ensure thatsafety issues areconsidered throughout aproduct’sdevelopment. This is important forall products and it is vital for PEMS. Safety cannotbe addedto aPEMSafter it has beendeveloped.Tworeasons for this are as follows.a) The actual PROCESSESused in thedevelopment of aPEMS, and the quality andrigourofthose PROCESSES, are decided as a result of RISK ASSESSMENT. If it isdiscovered later onthat inappropriatePROCESSES wereused orthat inadequate quality and rigour were applied, then the development will have to be repeated with correct PROCESSES. b)Changes made ata late stage in thePEMS DEVELOPMENTLIFE-CYCLE are likely to be expensive (both intime and money). Thisis particularly trueif a system requirement isincorrectormissing. Systemarchitecturecan also be vulnerable to late changes. Often,the architectureispart of the safety case. Late changes can requiresignificant reworkinorder tomaintain the integrity ofanarchitectural solution. FrameworkA life-cycle for thedevelopmentofa product provides aframework that allows the necessarysafety activities to take place ina timely and systematic manner. It should not imposeunnecessary restrictionsand it should ensure that all the required safety activitiestakeplace.The life-cycle needs to be decidedearly. Different life-cyclemodels are acceptable. Clause H.2 explainsPEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLES in more detail. IEC62304[26] describesthe PROCESSES to be included in the softwaredevelopment life-cycle for the development ofsafe medical device software.

Thesequence ofactivities in the life-cycleis required to be defined in terms ofmilestonesbecause this offers the greatest flexibility to the MANUFACTURER. No requirement is madeconcerning the number or nature of the milestones, nor is there any implication thatall project activities have topass through themilestonessimultaneously. Thisstandardhas not used theterm “phases”although this termwasused in IEC60601-1-4 [14]. The term has been avoidedbecauseit is difficult toexpressconcurrency andoverlap in aphase model. In a good life-cycle: – the necessary activities are defined in advanceof their performance;– the PROCESSES usedin development activities could be specifiedas an outcome ofRISK MANAGEMENT; – the sequence ofactivities isdefined so asto ensure that necessary inputsto an activityare availablebeforethe activity starts; – criteria are defined for decidingwhether theactivity hasbeensatisfactorily completed;and– accountability is facilitated.Activities are defined in terms of inputs and outputs becauseit is simpleto measure whetherthose inputs and outputs exist. The MANUFACTURERis responsiblefor deciding howthe milestones are achievedandhow the requireddocumentation isproduced. In orderto determine whether each activity has been satisfactorily completed, it is requiredthat the criteria for VERIFICATION of each activity be defined. VERIFICATION examineswhether theinputs havebeen transformed into the outputscompletely, correctly andaccording to the required PROCESS. Norequirement is madeconcerning the type orextent ofVERIFICATION, except for VERIFICATION of RISK CONTROL measures andESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE (see14.10). Subclause 14.5 – Problem resolution Where appropriate, a documentedsystem for problem resolution isrequiredby thisstandard. Problems canarise:– withtheproduct; – withinaPROCESS; – between PROCESSES.

A RISK CONTROL measurethat is developed using PROCEDURES and tools that are known to be good is more likely tocarry out its intended functions than one developedusing PROCEDURESand tools that are ofunknown quality. Subclause 14.7 – Requirement specification RISK CONTROLmeasures are used to control the RISK of identifiedHAZARDS. The requirementsforthese measures are documentedin requirement specifications. The requirement shouldboth specify whatthemeasure does and how well it does it. ISO14971 does not demand arequirements specification.Verifiable requirements Requirementsshould be verifiable. This applies toboth the functionof theRISK CONTROLmeasure and how likely it is to perform correctly. QuantitativeVERIFICATION of failure rates is, generally, impractical forsoftware. VERIFICATION of a qualitative approachwould be byverifying that theappropriate PROCESSES were used. Identifiable safety requirements The requirement to distinguish theRISK CONTROL measuresand ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is needed toensure that theyare implemented and to ensurethat if thereisa need to changethe ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE or aRISK CONTROL measure, the impact of the change on the RESIDUAL RISK can be assessed.DecompositionExamples ofa PEMS structure are showninAnnex H.

This can be in a singledocumentorin several documents. Subclause 14.8 – Architecture An architecture specification isnot required by ISO14971. It is an additional requirement for PEMS because:–often the architecture chosen will be part of a RISK CONTROL measure.RISK CONTROLmeasures needtobe explicit for complex systems such as aPEMS; – architecture specifications are recognizedas a necessary partofa good softwaredevelopmentPROCESS such asis requiredfor aPEMS.

If there is no separation of duties among the sections of the software,all softwareshould be definedas critical,to make sure that the analysis hastaken into consideration the critical section of the software. Requirementsfor separating critical codefrom non-critical codeincludeRISK ASSESSMENT of the entiresystem, RISK CONTROLstrategies employed, analysis of physical resources and ananalysis oflogical properties (e.g., control and data coupling). In general, partitioning should separate and isolate the safety-related functionality from thenon-safety-related functionality in the design and implementation. ThisPROCESScan minimize, orat least reduce, the VERIFICATION necessary to assure that data shared byor passed tothe critical section does not affect the specified operation of the safety critical code. Partitioning includesthe following steps: a) identification of critical, non-criticalandsupervisory sections. The means of identificationdepends uponthe modularity ofthe code, the programming language, the code designandother specification attributes; b)description oftheinterfacesbetween the critical and non-critical sections: 1) identification of data or variables global to thecritical andnon-criticalsections, modules, etc., identifiedin step a); 2)identification of any parameters that arepassed between critical and non-critical sections, modules, etc.,identifiedin step a); 3)description oftheflowof the data, variables or parametersidentified in steps b)1) and b) 2); 4) description of themechanism whichis usedto prevent datacorruption, overwriting orother errors of the above identified data, variables or parameterswhich wouldaffectsafety critical performance;c) validation of the integrity of the partition.Thiscanbe accomplished by functional testing and stress testing techniques. Subclause 14.8 g) to n)There isa listof itemstobe taken into consideration in the architecture specification. Thislisthas been selected because each of theseitems could influencethe choiceof architecture. Subclause 14.9 – Design and implementationThe technical solutions chosen need to be defined. It isoftenappropriate to decomposeaPEMS into subsystems. FigureH.1 shows examples ofPEMS/ PESS structures withdifferent amounts of decomposition. Reasonsfor decomposing a PEMScould include the following.

The resulting design is more likely to becorrect and easier to test. Codingstandards should specify limits forcomplexity. ArchitectureThe system architecture could make it logicalto separate systems e.g. ifdiverse systems areneeded they shouldbeimplemented as distinctsubsystems. Modularity Modularity can facilitate the provision ofdifferent system options, reuseof anexisting provensubsystem and the extension ofsystem functionality. Physical componentsA sensibledivision ofphysical subsystemswill help the diagnosis andrepair of hardware faults. Different technologies Often different engineers will implement the hardware and the software design. Inthis case specifying each as a separate subsystem will enable each to be implemented independently. The overall system will only function correctly if each of its constituent subsystems has been adequately specified.This leads tothe requirement for a design specification foreachsubsystem. A design specificationfor a subsystem wouldtypically include a detailedinterface specification,and could include implementation details, e.g. algorithms. Each subsystem should be testedto showthatthe design specification has been correctly implemented. Thisleads to therequirement fora testspecification foreachsubsystem. The design andtest specifications can bedocumented in whatever form is practicable, e.g. they can beseparate documents or they can be combined in alarger document. Thedesignspecification and the test specification for each subsystemshould be identifiable. Examples of the elements of the design environment are given inH.4 a). Such elementswillhave an influence on the quality and correctness of the design. Some elements will havebeen identified as the suitably validated tools and PROCEDURES (see14.6.2). The descriptivedataregardingthe design environmentfacilitates VERIFICATION that thesuitably validated toolsandPROCEDUREShave been used. Subclause 14.10– VERIFICATIONISO 14971 requires VERIFICATION ofRISK CONTROL measures. Thereare additional requirements forPEMS. These are that: – theESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is verified; and – thereisaVERIFICATION plan. ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is significant for PEMS becausethe PEMS uses aPESS to control its functions. ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE will often depend onthe PEMS functions beingcarriedout correctly.

This isabetterand more flexibleapproach thanspecifyinghow to verify aPEMS in thisclause. The MANUFACTURER isresponsible for planning theVERIFICATION so thatit isadequately thorough and then to implement theplan. Therequirement listsactivities that affect the thoroughnessof theVERIFICATION andwhich need tobe planned. Subclause 14.11– PEMS VALIDATIONThe final phase of any PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE model isPEMS VALIDATION. PEMS VALIDATIONis intendedto assurethat the right product is built. Validation is important forPEMSbecauseunexpected interactions between functions might occur that can only be discovered by validation.PEMSVALIDATIONcan include tests for a highvolume of data, heavy loads or stresses, human factors, security, performance, configuration compatibility, fault testing,documentation andsafety. Independence is needed to avoidconflicts of interest and because the assumptions of the designer should not influence orlimit the extent of the PEMS VALIDATION. Examplesof level of independence include:– separate person; – separatemanagement; – separateorganization. Subclause 14.12 – Modification Typically the design of a PEMSis not completely newbut ispartly or even largely derived fromearlier design(s). Nevertheless, it might bepossible to treat the design asif it were completely new and to establish the RISK MANAGEMENT report anddemonstrate compliancewith therequirements of thisstandardwithout reference to previous documentation. If however the RISK MANAGEMENT report does need to includesome information from the documentationof the previous design(s), it is then necessary to confirm that allsuch informationremains validdespitethe changes introduced inthenew design. Subclause 14.13– Connectionof a PEMS byNETWORK/DATA COUPLING to other equipmentMany hospitals are operatingMEEQUIPMENT ina networked environment today. Originally, these networkswere installed tooptimize businesseconomic and technical area. For this, afast electronic data interchange is required. Today, these networksareused for medical applications withinthe hospital, between hospitals,and from home. Initially, the use was only the exchange oflaboratory data. Nowthere are large amounts ofdata transportedover the networks, suchas medical imagedata. Thereare further requestsfrom the user to get “real time” solutions (e.g. control of operation robots via network). Additional guidanceonNETWORK/DATA COUPLING is found inAnnex H.Subclause 15.1– Arrangements of controls andindicatorsofMEEQUIPMENTControls, instruments, indicating lamps, etc. that are associated with a specific function oftheMEEQUIPMENT shouldbe grouped together.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 297 – Subclause 15.2 – ServiceabilityThe exchange of such parts isexpectedtobe easyto perform, preferably without special TOOLS. In addition, the disassembly of thewornout part orofthepartexchanged preventivelyand the assembly of the spare one should not create a HAZARD. To ensure this, the instructionsfor performingsuchactivitieshave to be easy to understandand to follow, withoutintroducing anyRISK of mix-up. Subclause 15.3.2 – Push testENCLOSURES need tohave adequate rigidity if they are to maintaina level ofprotection frominternal live parts. This requirement is harmonizedwith the force test of IEC60950-1. The force isdependent on theperson handling theMEEQUIPMENT, not the weight of the MEEQUIPMENT. In most cases,the application of aforce of 250N is considered reasonably foreseeable. However therecan becaseswhere aRISK ASSESSMENT finds that the 45 N forceapplied overan area of 625 mm2, as required bythe second edition ofthis standard, wouldcontinue tobe anacceptable VERIFICATION method fordetermining anacceptable level ofRISK. For example, ultrasound transducers andsimilar small HAND-HELD APPLIED PARTS, which balancetheneeds of robustness with other needs relatingto efficacy andbiocompatibility,have establishedtrackRECORDS of safety and effectiveness over manyyears,and therefore could continue to use the older VERIFICATION test. Internal components arenot subjected to the force test of IEC60950-1because their robustness is verifiedper the testsof 15.3.4 and15.3.5.Subclause 15.3.3 – ImpacttestAn ENCLOSURE’Sresistance to impact isrequired toprevent unacceptableRISK during reasonably foreseeablemisuse. The energyof the test impact approximatesMEEQUIPMENTbeing accidentally struck byan objectin the hand of a passer-by or bya broomstick or mop handle during cleaning of thefloor. Thetest equipment has been simplified and harmonizedwith other standards containing ENCLOSURE impact requirements, including IEC60950-1. Where a MANUFACTURER feels the requirementsof this subclausearenot necessary tomitigate anunacceptableRISK, justification is documented in theRISK MANAGEMENTFILE per 4.5, along with an identification ofalternate requirements met. For example,FIXEDMEEQUIPMENT can have oneside oftheENCLOSURE protected by the floor, wall or ceiling.TheMANUFACTURER documents the evaluation of the probabilitythat the MEEQUIPMENT could bemoved or installed incorrectly. TheMANUFACTURER also evaluates and identifies, through theRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, what resistance toimpact the protected side of the ENCLOSUREneeds to have to ensure no unacceptableRISKS are generated by failure to comply with the original requirements of thissubclause. Subclause 15.3.4 – Drop testThe tests for HAND-HELDMEEQUIPMENT or itsparts thatarehand heldare different from the test for PORTABLE and MOBILE MEEQUIPMENTbecauseof thedifference in practical application. A drop surface of wood of density > 600 kg/m3 allowsselection of mostcommonhardwoods. Oak,beech,birch, ash and maple are acceptable. These varieties have similar hardness while hardwoods of density <600kg/m3 (e.g. mahogany, elm, sweet gum, cherry) andsoftwoodshave greatly decreasedhardness in comparison.

Thistest isnot intended to represent reasonably foreseeable misuse. There is not currently a test thatdirectly addresses freefall typereasonably foreseeable misuse, however it is felt the ball impact test in 15.3.3represents foreseeable misuse, albeit indirectly. As stated in4.2, if theRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS concludesthat amore severetest is appropriate, this should bedone. Subclause 15.3.5 – Rough handling testContrary to what is often assumed,MEEQUIPMENTcan beused in a hostile environment. Incase ofemergency, MEEQUIPMENT iscarried or wheeledon trolleys over doorstepsand into elevators and subjected to bumps andvibration. Such conditions can in facttypify NORMAL USEfor some MEEQUIPMENT. Encountering obstaclesis considered commonplace and quite reasonably foreseeable misuse. Not all obstacles areclearly marked and theOPERATORcannot alwaysstop theMEEQUIPMENT in timeafter havingbecomeaware of the obstacleThe test requirementsof 15.3.5 are meant to judge resistance to rough handling, and notstability. Stability test requirementsfor MOBILEMEEQUIPMENTare in 9.4. The meaning of “in its normal direction of travel” is the direction(s) the MEEQUIPMENT is likelyto travel at themaximum normal speed. For most cases, this would betheforward direction.Some MEEQUIPMENT, such as a bed, is likely to travelin a forward or backward direction,atnormal speed, and thereforeeach test shouldbeconsidered for eachdirection.Subclause 15.3.6 – Mould stress relief testMany thermoforming PROCESSES can leave residual stresses in plastics. Because polymer chainsare held together by weak van der Waals bonds, these residual stresses can result inviscousflow (deformation).Elevatedtemperature results in weakening ofvan der Waalsbonds and an increase in the rateof viscous flow. Thermoplasticswith low melting temperatures, such aspolyethylene and polypropylene, are more susceptible tostress reliefdeformation than polymerswith higher melting temperatures, such as polycarbonate and polyetheramide. Compliance should be verified by analysis of the polymer properties, when possible. ThisVERIFICATIONshould consist of adocumented comparison of the maximum temperaturethepolymer will be exposed to in NORMAL USE and the polymer manufacturer’srecommendedtemperature userange. Subclause 15.3.7 – Environmentalinfluencesa) MEEQUIPMENT is often usedorstored inenvironmentalconditions that arewithin the INTENDED USE as declared by the MANUFACTER. In such cases no HAZARD is expected.However the environmental conditions could differfrom those declared and still the MEEQUIPMENT is expected to remain safe. To ensure this, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONhas to performthe periodic inspection and maintenance prescribed bytheMANUFACTURER. Theseactivities are expected to prevent any deteriorationof the safety level and alsodetectsigns ofcommencing of any suchdeterioration.To ensure this, theinstructions for preventivemaintenance have to be easy tounderstand and to follow, without introducingany RISK formix-upsor for overlooking of safety-relevant symptoms.

In addition, the disassembly of the worn out part or of the part exchangedpreventively and the assembly of the spare one should not create a HAZARD. To ensurethis, the instructions for performingsuchactivities have tobeeasy tounderstandand to follow, without introducing any RISK of mix-up. Subclause 15.4.3 – Batteries If a HAZARDOUS SITUATION might develop asa result ofexhaustion of thebattery, means should be providedtoforewarn of this condition. Whereappropriate,particular standards should specify the corresponding requirement. Subclause 15.4.4 – Indicators It isimportant for an OPERATOR and SERVICE PERSONNEL tobe able to determine the functional status of MEEQUIPMENT. In NORMAL USE, the OPERATOR needs to be able to distinguishbetween MEEQUIPMENT in stand-byand MEEQUIPMENT ina fully functional state. SomeMEEQUIPMENT has an extended warm-up period. Other MEEQUIPMENT has standby or batterycharging modes. It can be hazardous forMEEQUIPMENT to be left unattended in the wrong state. SERVICEPERSONNEL needto beableto determine whenMEEQUIPMENT is energized toavoidHAZARDS.Subclause 15.4.7.3 – Entry of liquids The former IPX8 ratingrequirement for footswitchesamounts tono more than“greaterprotection thanIPX7.” By making this requirement IPX6 minimum, the requirement sets adefined level of protectionwhile allowing higherlevelswhereappropriate. For equipmentusedonthe floor in areas where liquids are usually not found,the IPX1requirement is included becauseit is considered extremely likely that some wetting will occur. Subclause 15.5 – MAINS SUPPLY TRANSFORMERS ofMEEQUIPMENT and transformersprovidingseparation in accordancewith8.5Theaddition of“and transformers providingseparation inaccordancewith 8.5” to the originaltitle thatonly identified“Mains transformers” isintentional. The tests fortransformers shouldbe utilized any timethat the transformer is used to establish separation betweenOPERATORS, PATIENTS,etc.and aHAZARD. Revisions to 15.5 do not changesignificantly current methods (including thoseof thesecondedition of this standard) of testing. The methods and requirements were simplified and now include all different typesofprotectors like:PTCs, feedback control (switch mode powersupplies), primary or secondary over-current devices, etc.Thosetransformersthat have notbeen tested inaccordancewith the5X frequency and5X voltage testsof 15.5.2 to establishthe adequacy ofinsulation betweenthe turnsof awinding that areshorted at the terminals (rather thanexternal to the transformer) to assure that failure of that insulationwill not causemaximum allowable temperatures tobe exceeded.Because of the difficulties that would be encountered when trying to test transformers thatareRATEDforhighfrequencies (such asthose used in switchmode power supplies),the 2Xfrequency and voltage tests are specifiedinthose cases as well. The secondedition onlyapplied this test where the voltage exceeded 500V.

Thereforethis combination of conditions is considered thelikely worstcase scenario. The intentof the requirement is totest under theworst-casecondition (nearly alwayswith either a full loadorno-load). Sucha worst case can be determined through evaluation of thetransformer design or byperforming afew spottests. Generally, testing all possible conditions to determine worst case isunnecessary. The limits of Table 31areapplied at a 25 °Cambient because of the impracticality ofperforming the overloadand short tests inside of a thermal chamber. Subclause 15.5.2 – Dielectric strength It is necessary to raise the frequency of the test voltage in proportion to the voltage toprevent saturation ofthe magnetic core and consequent veryhigh current. The electricalinsulationbetween theprimary winding and other windings, screens andthecore of a MAINS SUPPLYTRANSFORMER is presumed to have beeninvestigated by thedielectricstrength tests performed on the assembled MEEQUIPMENT as described in8.8.3. The dielectricstrength tests of 8.8.3 need not berepeated. Subclause 15.5.3– Construction of transformersused toprovide separation asrequiredby 8.5 Therequirementsspecified in IEC61558-1, Subclause5.12 aregenerally similar to those in the second edition of this standard but transformers complying with them are likely to be more readily available.Additionally, Annex UofIEC60950-1:2001 includesrequirements relating to the useof triple-insulated winding wireintransformers instead of a separate layer ofinsulation between windings (as would betraditionally be provided by bobbinsfor example). Transformers whichusethis method of separation between windings and which comply with all other requirementsofthis standard should generally be consideredtoprovide an adequatelevel ofBASIC SAFETY. Clause 16 –ME SYSTEMSIncreasingly, MEEQUIPMENTis being combined with other pieces of equipment that might not have originally beenintendedfor medical applicationto create systems where one or more ofthe elements of the system come intocontact with the PATIENT. Clause 16 provides requirements to ensure thesafety of the PATIENT whocould comeinto contact withMESYSTEMS. Clause 16 on MESYSTEMS is intended to be used byMANUFACTURERS of combinations ofelectrical equipment that include one or more items ofMEEQUIPMENT. The equipment can be separate items orcanbe in asingle ENCLOSURE ora combination ofthese cases.Clause16 is also intended tobe used by personnel from institutions formedical practicewho assemble or adapt MESYSTEMS, as theycan become theMANUFACTURERby that action. In this case, engineering expertise in the application of the electrical equipment design standards is required toensure that the MESYSTEMcomplies withall requirements of Clause 16.

MEEQUIPMENT complying with this standard can be connected with other, non-MEEQUIPMENT. Thelatter equipment might fully meet the requirements in thesafety standards applicableintheir specific applicationfield. However, they donot alwayscomply with the safety requirements for MEEQUIPMENT and, thereby, influencethe safety of the whole MESYSTEM. It is for thisreason that the MANUFACTURER isrequired to apply RISK MANAGEMENT to the whole MESYSTEM. One example of anadditionalHAZARD is the ignitionoffire when an MESYSTEM containingnon-MEEQUIPMENTis used in anOXYGEN RICHENVIRONMENT, possibly accidentally. Theelectricalequipment can besituatedeitherin a medically usedroom that is intended fordiagnosis, treatment or monitoring ofPATIENTS, orin anon-medically used room where no medical practice isperformed.Within amedically usedroom, electrical equipment might be placed inside oroutsidea volumethat isdefined asPATIENT ENVIRONMENT. There are two situations possible in medical practice.a)Where Clause16 does not apply Simultaneously operated MEEQUIPMENT, i.e. different MEEQUIPMENTconnected at thesametime to a PATIENT butnot connected to each other.SuchMEEQUIPMENT can influence each other. For example, high-frequency surgicalequipment in the operating theatre caninfluencePATIENT monitoring. NOTE  Assistance can be available from the instructions for use for eachMEEQUIPMENT. b) Where Clause 16 applies MESYSTEMS, consisting ofMEEQUIPMENTand possibly alsonon-MEEQUIPMENT, interconnected permanently ortemporarily for a certain purpose such as diagnosis or treatment ofa PATIENT. Examples: MESYSTEMS fordiagnostic X-ray examination,endoscopes with videocamera, PATIENT monitoring, ultrasoundequipment with apersonal computer, computed tomography or magnetic resonanceimaging.The various parts of such anMESYSTEM could be situated withinthePATIENT ENVIRONMENTor outside itbut still withina medically used room, or parts of the MESYSTEM could belocated in a non-medically used room containing, for example, electricalpower distributionor data processingequipment. Subclause 16.1 – General requirements for the MESYSTEMSThe basic requirement for the safetyof ME SYSTEMS is that, after installation orsubsequent modification, an MESYSTEMdoes not result in anunacceptableRISK.Compliance withtherequirements imposedonME SYSTEMS in thisstandardwill imply that theRESIDUAL RISK ispresumed to beacceptable, unless there isOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE to the contrary.The MANUFACTURER ofMESYSTEMS that can be reconfigured bytheOPERATOR or the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION could be challenged to provide informationon all possiblecombinations ofthe equipment, which could represent anunreasonable burden. RISKMANAGEMENTmethods provide a very adequate means of determining which combination of items constitutes the largestRISKS, andwhichmeasuresneed tobe taken to provide for theadequate level ofsafety. Ultimately, compliance testing canbe done after assembly of the completeMESYSTEM.

MESYSTEMS, by theirnature, canbe frequently modified; Clause16 doesnot apply to themodificationof individual items in anMESYSTEMSubclause 16.2 – ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS ofanMESYSTEMThe documents that accompany anMESYSTEM intended forDIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATIONshould provide data on such items as: – use of rubber gloves; – use of stop-cocksmade ofinsulating material; –minimum distances betweenPATIENT and equipment being part of the MESYSTEM (PATIENT ENVIRONMENT); – instructionsabout how to use theMEEQUIPMENT in the typical medical application, for example, use of a catheter. Forsafety reasons, particularattentionshouldbe paid to the different levels ofRISK when, within the PATIENT ENVIRONMENT, electrodes or other body sensors are used on the PATIENT, externally and internally, including direct connectionstotheheart. Possible connectionsto the heart ofaPATIENTshouldbekept isolated from the equipment.The warning not to place MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS on thefloor isto prevent the ingress of liquids and toprevent mechanical damage. Furthermore, measuresshould be taken toensure that, when assembling ormodifying anMESYSTEM incorporating MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETS, these are mounted insucha way as toprevent ingressof liquids and to avoid mechanicaldamageduringNORMAL USE and transportation. Relevant safety standardsfor non-MEEQUIPMENTcould specify or require disclosure of permissible environmental conditions. Accordingly, the environmental conditionspermitted forvarious items in anMESYSTEM can be different. The permissible environmental conditions for the MESYSTEM is tobe specified so that noHAZARD will arise whenoperating it withinthese specified limits. Subclause 16.3 – Power supplyThis requirement is toensure thesafety according to IEC60601-1at the MESYSTEM level.BASIC SAFETY afterassembly ismaintained, for example, by one or more of the following measures: – measures that are built-in within the MEEQUIPMENT, for example, separation ofrelevantcircuits;– SEPARATION DEVICES provided asACCESSORIES to the MEEQUIPMENT (see16.5); – SEPARATION DEVICES provided asACCESSORIES to the MESYSTEM; – separatingtransformer;– additional PROTECTIVE EARTH CONDUCTORS.

HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS could occur if the SIGNAL INPUT/OUTPUT PART of MEEQUIPMENT is connected toequipment outside the medically used room, possibly in another building and therefore connectedto another mains supply branch circuit. A SEPARATION DEVICE prevents a HAZARD to thePATIENT orOPERATOR. Additionally, the inclusion of the SEPARATION DEVICE helps to avoid HAZARDSthrough malfunction ofequipment caused byunwantedcurrents flowing throughcables. The need for a SEPARATION DEVICE dependson theconfiguration of theMESYSTEM. Subclause 16.6 – LEAKAGE CURRENTSRelevant standards forsome non-MEEQUIPMENT can have limits forTOUCH CURRENTS that are higherthan required by Clause 16; these higher limits are acceptableonly outsidethePATIENTENVIRONMENT. It is essential toreduceTOUCH CURRENTS when non-MEEQUIPMENT is to be usedwithin thePATIENT ENVIRONMENT. LEAKAGE CURRENTreduction measures can include: – additional PROTECTIVELY EARTHED parts; – aseparating transformer; – anadditional non-conductiveENCLOSURE. Interconnecting cables andtheir connectorhousings are parts oftheENCLOSURE andthereforethe LEAKAGE CURRENT limits withinthe PATIENT ENVIRONMENT, as required in 16.6.1, areapplicable. If a MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETwithout a separating transformer isused, the interruptionof its protective earthingcould result inTOUCH CURRENTS equal to thesum oftheindividual EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENTS. Subclause 16.6.3 – PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENTFor ME EQUIPMENT, the maximumallowed values for PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT and total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT (applicable with severalAPPLIED PARTSconnected to theME EQUIPMENT)are given in Table 3 and Table 4; see also 8.7.3. AnME SYSTEM is to provide theequivalent level of safetyas providedby ME EQUIPMENT within the PATIENT ENVIRONMENT (see 16.1). Therefore, the same maximum values for PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT and total PATIENT LEAKAGE CURRENT apply,regardless whether theAPPLIED PARTSare connected to thesame element of the ME SYSTEM or not.This holds for the operation of theME SYSTEM in NORMALCONDITION, as thesinglefault concept isnot applicable toanME SYSTEM. It should be noted that combinations of equipment or ofAPPLIED PARTS, made by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION or OPERATOR, that are outside the range ofcombinations indicated by the MANUFACTURER,could lead to HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS. Thiswarning holds in particular when combinations of equipment are usedfor medical purposes onthe samePATIENT, which have not been intended by their MANUFACTURER(S)to be usedin such combinations.BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 304 – Subclause 16.7 –Protectionagainst MECHANICAL HAZARDSAttention should bepaid to the effects of interruptionscausing unplanned movements, removal of compression forces, and thesafe removal of PATIENTS from the PATIENT ENVIRONMENT when a HAZARDOUS SITUATION occurs. Subclause 16.9.2.1 – MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLETThesecond edition ofthisstandard used the defined term “auxiliary mainssocket-outlet(AMSO)” to describe a socket-outlet intended for provision of mainssupply to other MEEQUIPMENTorto other separateparts of theMEEQUIPMENT. The systems collateral standard, IEC60601-1-1 [13], defined a term “multiple portable socket-outlet(MPSO)”. Thetwo terms havebeencombinedintoa new term, “MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLET(MSO).” Subclause57.2e) of the second edition required that anAMSObedesignedso that it could not accept a MAINS PLUG. An exception for EMERGENCY TROLLEYS was allowed. With the combination of thetwo definitions and the change to 8.11.2 to require anyMSO onME EQUIPMENTto comply with 16.9.2.1, the need forrapid exchange in an emergency situation isreconciled with the needto restrict LEAKAGE CURRENT. Reassignment of the MAINS CONNECTION for the MESYSTEM isa dangerouspractice and beyond the scopeof this clause. See 16.2 for disclosure requirements.Excessive TOUCH CURRENTS can occur unless casual access for additional equipmentconnections is impeded orprevented. Subclause 16.9.2.1 c), 3rd dash MEEQUIPMENTwith a non-DETACHABLE POWER SUPPLYCORD has an impedancebetween the protective earth pin in the MAINSPLUG and any part that isPROTECTIVELYEARTHED thatdoesnot exceed 200 mΩ. Similarly, the MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLET has an impedance that doesnot exceed 200mΩ between itsMAINSPLUG and its socket-outlets. This results in an impedance thatdoes not exceed400mΩ between the MULTIPLE SOCKET-OUTLET MAINSPLUG and any part of MEEQUIPMENT that isPROTECTIVELYEARTHED. The impedanceofPROTECTIVE EARTHCONNECTIONS is allowed to exceed 200 mΩ whenthe relevant circuits have limited current capability (see 8.6.4 b)).In such cases in MEEQUIPMENT, thisresults in an impedancebetween theprotectiveearthpin in theMAINSPLUGand any part that isPROTECTIVELYEARTHEDthat exceeds 400 mΩ. Subclause 16.9.2.1 d)The TOUCH CURRENT of theMESYSTEM mustbe less than 500μA in SINGLE FAULT CONDITION. A separatingtransformer can be used as ameasureto reduce thatTOUCH CURRENT. Thereforeaseparating transformer withBASIC INSULATION is sufficient. TheDOUBLE orREINFORCEDINSULATION asrequired for isolating transformers isnot needed. The CLASSI requirement for the transformer assembly isnecessary to provideconnected equipment with a PROTECTIVE EARTH CONNECTION. Isolation monitoring of the separating transformer isnot necessary. SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONcan bedetected during routinemaintenance and the occurrence oftwo independent SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONSis of no concern.Thetransformer construction can be of atype with orwithout a PROTECTIVELY EARTHED centre tapped secondary winding.

Within thePATIENT ENVIRONMENT it is important to limit potential differencesbetweendifferentparts of an MESYSTEM, and an adequate connection witha protectiveearthing system plays an important role in limiting that potential difference. It is therefore important to prevent interruption of that protective means to any part ofthe MESYSTEM. –The additional protectiveearthing could be used whenthe TOUCH CURRENTin SINGLE FAULT CONDITION exceeds the allowable limits. –The additional protectiveearthing is not necessary for MEEQUIPMENT complying withthisstandard. However, in thecase ofnon-MEEQUIPMENT thiswill prevent TOUCH CURRENTS exceeding allowable limits. –The use of aTOOL is not required todisconnect theMAINS PLUG because the MAINS PLUGwill disconnect boththe mains andthe protectiveearth. Clause 17 – Electromagnetic compatibility of MEEQUIPMENT andMESYSTEMSIEC60601-1-2specifies electromagnetic immunity test levels to minimize the effect of the electromagnetic environment on the MEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS covered by thisstandard. It specifieselectromagnetic emissions limits to minimize theeffecton other equipment ofelectromagnetic disturbancesthatcould be emitted,intentionally or unintentionally, byMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS. It alsospecifies requirements foridentification, markingand documents so that the MANUFACTURER of the MEEQUIPMENT or MESYSTEM provides information to the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION thatisessential indetermining the suitability of theMEEQUIPMENT or ME SYSTEM for the electromagnetic environmentof use, and in managing the electromagnetic environmentof use to permit the MEEQUIPMENT orMESYSTEM tomaintain BASIC SAFETY and provide its ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE without disturbing other equipment. Electromagneticemissionrequirements arenecessary for the protection of: – safety services (e.g. police, fireand ambulance communications); – otherMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMS; – non-MEEQUIPMENT (e.g. computers);– telecommunications(e.g. radio/TV, telephone,radio-navigation). Moreimportantly, electromagnetic immunity requirements are necessaryto assurethatMEEQUIPMENT andMESYSTEMS maintain BASIC SAFETY and continue toprovide their ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCEin thepresence of theelectromagnetic disturbances to which they can beexpected to be exposed during NORMAL USE.

Thiswas done in recognition of the fact that flammable anaestheticsarerarely used and theiruseis expectedto cease entirely within a short period.However, it is also recognized that thepracticeofmedicinechanges frequently and that even now someMANUFACTURERS might still want tooffer MEEQUIPMENT forsuchapplications. In order toassure that the materialcontained in Sectionsix along withthe associated CATEGORY AP and CATEGORYAPGRATINGSremain available while improving the readability of the standard for most users, the materialhasbeen moved to Annex G.Subclause G.1.3 – Requirementsfor MEEQUIPMENTThemost devastating accidents with flammable anaestheticagents occur whenthe mixture of the agent with oxygen normally used isthat which will causethemost rapid combustion, a state that sometimes is describedas“detonation optimum.” The worst example of such anagent iscyclopropane, while the oxygen/ether mixture normally used is far below that point. Subclause G.5.3 – Low-energycircuits Thegraphs of Figure G.1, Figure G.2 and FigureG.3are given to assistin the design ofcircuits that fulfil the requirements for allowable limitsstated for CATEGORY AP MEEQUIPMENTwithout performing the ignition test.Extrapolation for highervoltages is not valid because the ignitioncondition of gases changesat higher voltages. Thelimit for inductancesis introduced because highinductancevaluesgenerally produce higher voltages. Subclause G.5.4 – External ventilation with internal overpressureThe amount of air or inert gas escaping from the MEEQUIPMENT by leakage isassumed to belimited so thathygienic conditionsin the medically used room are not disturbed appreciably.

New and improved symbols and safety signs havebeen introducedsince the publication of thesecondeditionof IEC60601-1 which necessitates changes inthe list ofapproved symbolsand safety signsfor use onMEEQUIPMENT. Chief among thesechanges is therevisionof theusage of symbol 24in TableD.1.  Thissymbolwasformally used to indicate a warningas well as an informative marking (e.g. this iswhere the HIGH VOLTAGE is connected). A new safety sign (3)inTable D.2has been addedtoindicate, “Warning:Dangerous Voltage.” In this editionof the standard, thesafety signsofTable D.2 are required where a warning is intended while the symbols in Table D.1 are usedwhen the intention issolely to inform. Similarly is the revision of the usage of symbol 10 in Table D.1, which was formerly used to indicate “attention: consult ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS”.That symbol is now used to indicatecaution. A new symbol (11) in Table D.1 has been added to indicate, “follow operatinginstructions”. Additionally, a new safety sign(10) in Table D.2 has been added to mark MEEQUIPMENT where failure to follow operating instructions couldplace thePATIENT orOPERATOR atRISK. Consistent use ofthese symbols and safety signs in all fields of use (e.g., medical, consumerproducts, and general transportation)will helpMEEQUIPMENTOPERATORS to becomefamiliarwith their meaning.Conversely, any inconsistent usewill leadtoconfusion and mistakes and jeopardize safety. IEC 60878 provides a usefulcompendiumof graphical symbols and safety sign used on electrical equipment in medical practice thatwerecomplied fromrelevant ISO and IECstandards. See also 7.5 and 7.6. Forsymbol requirements not met by the symbols in IEC 60878, refer inthe first instance to publishedIEC orISO symbols, notingthat, where necessary, two or more symbols can begrouped together toconvey aparticularmeaningand that, provided the essential communicative characteristicsofthe basic symbol are maintained, some latitude in graphicdesign ispermissible. The colours of symbols are not specified, except for the background of the AP and APG symbols (see Clause G.3). The colours of safety signs arespecified inISO 3864-1.

In HIGH VOLTAGEparts, sparks can be caused bycorona. Static discharges can cause sparks. The probability of occurrence of the ignition ofsuchanaesthetic mixtures depends on theirconcentration, the appropriate minimum ignitionenergy, the presenceof highsurfacetemperatures and the energy of sparking. G.1.2 Industrial equipmentand componentsTheconstructionalrequirements of IEC60079-0are generally not appropriate forMEEQUIPMENTfor several reasons: a)they lead to constructions of asize, weight ordesign that are not applicable for medical reasons orthat cannot be sterilizable; b)some constructions allow an explosion inside anENCLOSURE, but prevent propagationoutside it. Such a construction, which might be inherently safe, would be unacceptable in anoperating theatrewhere continuity of operation ofMEEQUIPMENT isessential;c) industrial requirementswere made for flammable agents mixed with air. They cannot beapplied to mixtures with oxygen ornitrousoxideused in medical practice; d) in medicalpractice flammable anaesthetic mixtures occur onlyinrelatively small quantities. However some ofthe constructions describedin IEC60079-0 are acceptable forCATEGORY APMEEQUIPMENT (seeG.5.1). G.1.3*  Requirements for MEEQUIPMENTIn this annex, thelocationof flammableanaesthetic mixtures isdescribed: – as much as necessaryfor theconstructionofMEEQUIPMENT, asminimum for specifiedconditionsof exhaust and absorption; BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 330 – – as much as necessary for the allocation of MEEQUIPMENT and theconstruction of theelectrical installation in the IEC 60364series. The recommendations, limitsand tests of thisannex arebased on the resultsof statistical considerations obtained fromexperimentswiththemost readily flammable mixtures of ethervapour with air and with oxygen, using the test apparatus described in Clause G.7. This isjustified becausecombinationswith ether have the lowest ignition temperaturesand thelowestignition energies of commonly used agents. Wheretemperatures or circuit parametersofMEEQUIPMENT used in a FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITHAIR exceed allowable limits and sparking cannot be avoided the relevant parts and circuits can be enclosed in ENCLOSURESwith pressurized inert gas or clean air or inENCLOSURES with restricted breathing. ENCLOSURES withrestricted breathing delay the build-upof an ignitable concentration. They arerecognized because it isassumed that a periodin whichMEEQUIPMENTis used inaFLAMMABLE ANAESTHETICMIXTURE WITH AIR is followed by a period of ventilation during whichsuch a concentration willdisappear. For MEEQUIPMENT containingor usedin aFLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH OXYGEN ORNITROUS OXIDE, requirements, limits and tests are far more stringent. These recommendations apply not only to NORMAL CONDITION but, additionally, in the SINGLEFAULT CONDITION, as indicated in4.7. Only two exemptions from an actual ignition test arerecognized, thesebeingeither the absence of sparks and limited temperature or limitedtemperature and restricted circuit parameters.G.2Locations and basic requirements G.2.1 Parts ofCATEGORY APGMEEQUIPMENTParts of CATEGORY APGMEEQUIPMENT in which a FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH AIRoccurs shallbe CATEGORY AP or APG MEEQUIPMENT and shall comply with the requirementsof Clause G.3, G.4 and G.5.G.2.2 FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITHAIRWhere a FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH AIR occursbecauseof a leakageor dischargeof a FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH OXYGEN OR NITROUS OXIDE from anENCLOSURE, it isconsidered to propagate toa volume surrounding the leakage or discharge point atadistance from 5 cm to25 cm from such a point.G.2.3 FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH OXYGEN OR NITROUS OXIDEA FLAMMABLE ANAESTHETIC MIXTURE WITH OXYGEN OR NITROUS OXIDE may be contained in acompletely or partlyenclosedMEEQUIPMENT part andinthe PATIENT’Srespiratory tract.

Figure H.1 shows some possible examples of a PEMS. FigureH.1a) shows a complex system. The PEMS breaks down into a number of majorsubsystems,which inturn are made up of subsystems, which include a PESS. Figure H.1b) shows a simpler implementation. In this case the intermediate majorsubsystem level ismissing and thePESSis a subsystem of the PEMS itself. Figure H.1c)illustratesthe simplest implementation of aPEMS. In thiscase the PEMS and the PESS are the same. The structure of the PEMS isextremely important for implementingsafety requirements. Anarchitectureshould be documented for thePEMS that describes the structure of the PEMS andthe relationship between each PESS and the PEMS as a whole.The architecture shouldindicate: –the divisionof the PEMSintocomponents, especially those implemented ineachPESS andincluding software components; –the functions to be performed by each PESSandits components (including where appropriate safety-relatedfunctions); –the interfaces between software components; – the interfaces between software components and components external to the software. H.2 PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE model Compliance with the PEMS clauseof this standard (Clause 14) requiresthat aPEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE bespecified and then followed; it doesnot require that any particular PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE is used, but it does require that the PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE hascertainattributes.

The decomposition PROCESS concludes when the design information enables thecomponentsof thePEMSto be built (examples of such design information are circuit diagrams and softwarecode). Thedecomposition components are integrated together. VERIFICATION is performed asthecomponentsare integrated to determinewhether or not the implementationsatisfies the requirements. At the conclusion ofthe integration PROCESS, a PEMS VALIDATIONis performed to determine whether or not the PEMSworks as intended.H.3 Software PROCESSESH.3.1 PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLEA PEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE, such as the one illustrated in Figure H.2, consistsof anumber of PROCESSES that are composed ofactivities. Each activity is performedtoaccomplish specific goals. To apply RISK MANAGEMENT, confidence inthe engineering activitieson whichthe RISK MANAGEMENT is basedisneeded. In particular, thisis a requirement for the software life-cycle. IEC62304[26](underdevelopment) describes theprocesses tobe included in thesoftwaredevelopment life-cycle for the development of safe medical device software. H.3.2 Requirements specification To determine which functions create or control RISKS, it is necessaryto fully identify therequirements of the PEMS/PESS. It isnot possible todo an adequateRISK ASSESSMENT without a complete requirement specification and anarchitectural design that meets thatspecification.The requirements shouldinclude, as appropriate tothePEMS software: – functional and capability requirements, includingESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE, physical characteristics, and environmental conditions under whichthe softwareis toperform; – interfaces external to the software; – safety requirementsincluding RISK CONTROL measures forhardware failures andpotential software defects and specificationsrelated to methods ofoperation and maintenance,environmental influences, andRISK CONTROL; –software driven alarm signals, warnings and OPERATOR messages; – security requirements,where lack of security wouldcompromisesafety; – human-factorsengineering requirements related tothe use ofthePEMS, including those related tosupport for manual operations, human-equipment interactions, constraintsonpersonnel, and areas needingconcentrated human attention thatare sensitive tohumanerrors and training; – data definition and database requirements; –installation and acceptance requirements for the PEMS software; –documentation to be developed; –operation and execution requirements; – maintenancerequirements. RISK ASSESSMENT should be used to determine the extent to which the architecture design canbe usedto mitigatethe RISKS.

The developer shouldestablish software requirementsfor third-party or OTS software. These requirements should include the following:–title and manufacturer, version level, release date, patch number and upgradedesignation; – the system hardware and softwarenecessaryto support properoperation (e.g. processor type and speed, memory type and size, and system, communication anddisplay software requirements); – interfaces to thesoftwarecomponent; – safety critical and RISK CONTROL measure functions dependent on thesoftwarecomponent. H.3.4 Integration The developershouldestablish an integrationplan to integrate thecomponents of eachPESSand of the PEMS. The plan should include the approach, responsibilities and sequence, andinclude all software components. If the PESSsoftware isbuilt using incrementalintegration methods, sufficient regressiontesting should be performedto ensurethatpreviousVERIFICATION isstill sufficient. Integration tests shouldinclude testcases which exposesoftware behaviour not only inresponse to thenormal case, but also in response toexceptional, stressor worst case conditions. H.3.5 Configuration managementBecause the RISK ANALYSIS relies on the requirements of the software, configurationmanagement andchangecontrol arenecessary toensure that additional software functionality is notadded during development without being considered bythe RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. A configuration management planshouldbeestablished thatdescribes: –the items to be controlled; –the configuration managementactivities; – PROCEDURES andschedule for performing theseactivities; – responsibilities for performing these activities; – PROCEDURES to control the receipt, installation, and acceptance of each software component.A scheme shouldbe established for the uniqueidentification of software configuration items and version control. This scheme should include anythird-partyand OTSsoftwarecomponents. H.3.6 Modification/changecontrol For modification/change control, thefollowing shouldbe performed:– identification and recording of change requests; – analysis and evaluationof thechanges; – approval or disapproval ofthe request; – implementation, VERIFICATIONand release of the modified software.

NETWORK/DATA COUPLING asusedin this standard doesnot include information transferred across user interfaces. TheMANUFACTURERstipulates thepossible informationtypesand theirtransmission protocols in the technical description(see 14.13). H.6.2System integration responsibilitiesMEEQUIPMENT and MESYSTEMSwill sometimes be usedtogetherto create a system. Thisis likely to become morefrequent with the increasing use of computersto analyze clinical data and control treatment. SometimesMEEQUIPMENT will have been designed by the MANUFACTURERto work with otherMEEQUIPMENT, however, it will often be the case that the separateMEEQUIPMENT will nothavebeen designed to work with eachother. Someonehas tobe responsible for ensuring that all the separateMEEQUIPMENT work together satisfactorily in theintegrated system; in other words, someone has to be responsiblefor designing the integrated system. It is recognizedthat the system integratoroften hasto comply with particular regulatoryrequirements. In order toperform its function, thesystem integratorneeds toknow: – how the integratedsystem is intended tobe used; – therequiredperformance of the integratedsystem; – theintended configuration of thesystem; – the constraintsonthe extendibility of the system; – the specificationsof all MEEQUIPMENT andother equipment tobeintegrated; – the performance ofeachMEEQUIPMENT and other equipment; and– theinformation flowinand around the system. This information will not be available to the individualMANUFACTURERS, and for thisreason each individual MANUFACTURER cannot carry out the role of system integrator. In any casethesystem integratorhas tobe a single person or organisation that has overall responsibility, this overall responsibility can not be shared between severaldifferent MANUFACTURERS. The responsibility of a MANUFACTURER is limited to providing the required information on their equipment (see 14.13). Obviously a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION can employ a MANUFACTURER to integrate their system. In this case the whole system can become an MESYSTEM and it will be the MANUFACTURER’Sresponsibility to provideacorrectly integratedsystem. In thiscase the system could be separately regulated. The system integrator should be competent to assessandaddresstheHAZARDS thatare likely to arise from integratinga system and toensure that theRESIDUAL RISKSof the individual PEMSare maintained.

These instructionsshouldinclude warnings about the HAZARDS of any change of configuration. H.7 Designconsiderations for NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGH.7.1 IntroductionFrom the viewpoint ofaPEMS MANUFACTURER, any type of a NETWORK/DATA COUPLING is a source ofadditional causesforHAZARDS. In principle anyNETWORK/DATA COUPLING that isoutside the control of thePEMS MANUFACTURER should never be presumedto be 100% reliable. H.7.2 CausesofHAZARDS associated with NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGIn NETWORK/DATA COUPLEDsystems, likely causes for HAZARDS are: – lossofdata; – inappropriate data interchange;– corrupteddata; – inappropriatetiming of data; –unexpected receipt of data; – unauthorized access todata.Supplementing Annex A of ISO14971:2000when identifying the causes ofHAZARDSassociated withNETWORK/DATA COUPLING, at least the followingshould beconsidered: – remote servicing(external accessto the network); –operating system (compatibility of operating systems); – modification/upgradesof software (operating systems, applications, etc.);–interface compatibility (data collisions, dataformats): •connections (modificationof hardware,network connectors);•network interface boards (compatibility); •network protocols (DICOM, HL7,etc.);– packet address structure/timing; – normal network loads/bandwidth; – peaknetworkload; – data media (longevity and retrievability);– security (viruses, worms, unauthorized software updates orupgrades);– maximum acceptable response time; BS EN 60601-1:2006EN 60601-1:2006 (E)(cid:17263)(cid:28793)(cid:29289)(cid:26472)(cid:29728)(cid:17010)(cid:26996)(cid:26995)(cid:26656)(cid:21364)(cid:24942)(cid:25697)(cid:29284)(cid:29472)(cid:18798)(cid:29556)(cid:26996)(cid:30068)(cid:26991)(cid:28192)Provided by IHS under license with BSI - Uncontrolled Copy Licensee=Medtronic/5966437001, User=Haas, MichaelNot for Resale, 09/02/2011 12:47:40 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,``,``,``,,,,,,,`,,,,,``````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- – 353 – – acceptable failurerate of thenetwork; – availability of the network (planned and unplanned maintenance); – inconsistency ininterfaces/formats resulting in loss offidelity duringinformationtransfer;– heterogeneous network topologies. Supplementing Annex D of ISO14971:2000when considering the potential causes for HAZARDSlistedabove, the followingquestionsshould be taken into account: a)Reasonably foreseeable misusesIsconnection to the networkinconsistentwith theINTENDED USE ofeach constituent PEMS? b) Incorrect data flow to orfrom each constituent PEMSWhat are thedata transferredby the network used for,and to which tasksare theyrelated? What are the consequencesof a breakdown of the NETWORK/DATA COUPLING? c) Deviationfrom the specified operational characteristics of any constituent PEMSWhat are theoperational characteristics of the PEMS and towhat degree are they affected by the NETWORK/DATA COUPLING? d) Incompletecharacterization of NETWORK/DATA COUPLING parametersIsthe networktopology, configuration,parameters (e.g. open or closed, bandwidth, transmission protocol)completely characterized?Are there any breakdown characteristics/concepts and what arethese?e) Excessive use/loadof the NETWORK/DATA COUPLING by the network nodes What isthe planned numberof network nodes and their assumed degree of use? Are the resources sufficient tomeet theneeds of boththe NETWORK/DATA COUPLING itself and the devices connectedto it? f) Use errorsWhat skills arerequired by the OPERATOR for the effective operation of the system? g) InadequateconfigurationmanagementDo periodic service tasksalter the network’scharacteristics(e.g. afterremote access, updates or upgrades)? DoestheRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION ensure that modifications to each constituentPEMSare reviewed and approved? h) Information in wrong place Does data arrive at a convenient and predictablelocation?Is it accompanied by irrelevantdata that could confuse the OPERATOR or obscure the wanted data? When it arrives, is itssource adequately indicated? H.7.3Networkclassification based on the consequence to the PATIENTH.7.3.1Consequence to the PATIENTInorder torelate thecauses inH.7.2 to the consequences for the PATIENT, it may beuseful to classifyNETWORK/DATA COUPLINGSbothby the consequences and the reaction time, wherereaction time is the timedelay between a NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGfailure and the onset ofHARM to the PATIENT.  Table H.1 contains an exampleof a NETWORK/DATA COUPLING classification based on theseconsiderations.

It isnot linked to any other network, because a linkcould result in uncontrollable RISKS. All resources are availableonly for the nodesof this network.Theavailability needs to be close to 100%. Disruptionsneed tobeavoidedand last for only a fewminutes per year. Responsibility isassignedto a single PEMS MANUFACTURER/system contractor only. Network nodes comply withtherequirements established by thisMANUFACTURER/contractor. An example of thisclass is a PATIENTmonitoring network.

The availability needs tobe very high, and becauseof alack of alternatives, disruptions shouldlastonly for short periods. – Theresponsibility isassigned to theRESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION orsystem integrator. Inthe case of multiple PEMS, thecontentionofdata priority needs tobe defined.– The network nodes shouldfollow selected criteria/minimum set ofparameters. A radiology network canserve as anexample. H.7.3.4 Class A NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGThis istheNETWORK/DATA COUPLINGfor any applications (includingPATIENT administrative/ demographic data) thatoperate on validatedPATIENT data only andarenot assigned to class “C”or “B” networks. Also, it canbe acceptedthat these applications are unavailablefor a longer period because there are alternatives.

H.7.4 NETWORK/DATA COUPLING parametersThe useof a NETWORK/DATA COUPLING for exchange of dataeitherbetweenPEMS or between PEMS and other informationtechnologyequipment requires the knowledge about boththe structure of theNETWORK/DATA COUPLING and thePROCESSES/functions running inside them. This is important becauseMANUFACTURERS of PEMS or NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGS should selectthe configuration of their products such that: – theycomply withinternationally recognized network standards (Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, GigaBitEthernet, FDDI, etc.) anduse the available bandwidth appropriately according to the INTENDED USE; – they achieve the optimal performance fortheir applicationA mixture of different NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGS configurations/parameter settings can emergewhich are not alwayscompatible for the different NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGS nodes inspite ofthe fact that they complyto valid international standards. To avoid or at least to minimize the resulting potential of disruption, a match of a minimum setof NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGS parameters derived from therelevantstandards isrequired. To ensure a reliable installationofNETWORK/DATA COUPLEDPEMSand minimize theRISK to PATIENTS, the PEMS MANUFACTURER, the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION, and the system integratorneedto communicate all relevant technical parameters to each other. Thislevel ofdetailisnecessary toavoid inappropriate assumptions that result in unacceptableRISK. Figure H.4 contains a list of parameters potentially requiredto be specified. Duetothe rapid evolution of NETWORK/DATA COUPLINGtechnology, thistable should be seen as a startingpoint. It should be clear if the tableshould be maintained and whoshould be responsible formaintaining it.

A protectiveearth can be dedicated to each of the three localitieslisted above. NOTE A potential difference (V)can exist between the protective earths in different localities. In case of aninterruption of protective earthing (fault condition) for equipment in the PATIENT ENVIRONMENT, this potential difference can appear on the ENCLOSURE ofthe equipment causing a HAZARD for theOPERATORor for the PATIENT ifthe OPERATORsimultaneously touches the equipment and the PATIENT, or for the PATIENT if the MEEQUIPMENT is of TYPE B.

Although the material presented in a TIR may need further evaluation by experts, releasing the information is valuable because the industry and the professions have an immediate need for it. A TIR differs markedly from a standard or recommended practice, and readers should understand the differences between these documents. Standards and recommended practices are subject to a formal process of committee approval, public review, and resolution of all comments. This process of consensus is supervised by the AAMI Standards Board and, in the case of American National Standards, by the American National Standards Institute. A TIR is not subject to the same formal approval process as a standard. However, a TIR is approved for distribution by a technical committee and the AAMI Standards Board.  Another difference is that, although both standards and TIRs are periodically reviewed, a standard must be acted on—reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn—and the action formally approved usually every five years but at least every 10 years. For a TIR, AAMI consults with a technical committee about five years after the publication date (and periodically thereafter) for guidance on whether the document is still useful—that is, to check that the information is relevant or of historical value. If the information is not useful, the TIR is removed from circulation. A TIR may be developed because it is more responsive to underlying safety or performance issues than a standard or recommended practice, or because achieving consensus is extremely difficult or unlikely. Unlike a standard, a TIR permits the inclusion of differing viewpoints on technical issues. CAUTION NOTICE: This AAMI TIR may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Because it addresses a rapidly evolving field or technology, readers are cautioned to ensure that they have also considered information that may be more recent than this document. All standards, recommended practices, technical information reports, and other types of technical documents developed by AAMI are voluntary, and their application is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Occasionally, voluntary technical documents are adopted by government regulatory agencies or procurement authorities, in which case the adopting agency is responsible for enforcement of its rules and regulations.

It is widely recognized that there is little existing guidance for conducting cybersecurity risk assessment of medical devices.  The objective of this TIR is to provide guidance on how medical device manufacturers can manage risks from security threats that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the device or the information processed by the device. Because medical device manufacturers are already familiar with ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007, this guidance follows the basic structure of that standard.  Suggestions for improving this recommended practice are invited. Comments and suggested revisions should be sent to Technical Programs, AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633. NOTE  This foreword does not contain provisions of the AAMI TIR57, Principles for medical device security– Risk management (AAMI TIR57:2016), but it does provide important information about the development and intended use of the document. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  vii AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Introduction Medical device manufacturers are familiar with the requirements of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007/(R)2010 Medical devices — Application of risk management to medical devices. This standard is an integral part of the safety risk management processes required by many regulatory authorities. ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 specifies a process for a manufacturer to identify the hazards associated with medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices, to estimate and evaluate the associated risks, to control these risks, and to monitor the effectiveness of the controls (see Clause 1 of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007).  NOTE In 2012, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) adopted EN ISO 14971:2012 as the European harmonized standard, superseding EN ISO 14971:2009. This document does not address content deviations included in Annex ZA of EN ISO 14971:2012. Specifically, the “as far as possible” requirement is not included in the evaluation of security risks. Instead, security risks are to be assessed and controlled to a level that is considered acceptable, taking into account the impact of a threat event and potential vulnerabilities. Specific clauses of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 define a risk management process consisting of the following elements:  risk analysis (Clause 4);  risk evaluation (Clause 5);  risk control (Clause 6);  evaluation of overall residual risk acceptability (Clause 7);  risk management report (Clause 8); and  production and post-production information (Clause 9). Figure 1 of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 (see Figure 1) provides a schematic representation of the risk management process. Central to the definition of risk are the concepts of probability of an occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Harm is defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 as “physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment”. viii © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016                         Figure 1 - Schematic representation of the risk management process (ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007) The increased use of connected medical devices (i.e., devices directly connected to other systems or devices directly or via a computer network) has created a new source of risk for their safe operation. Security risks are associated with reduction of effectiveness and breach of data and systems security as included in the broader definition of harm in this document. While information security has been considered from the patient data privacy perspective for several years, there is no framework for security risk management for medical devices. This document describes a means of applying the risk management principles presented in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 to the management of security risk. The definition of harm is considered from the perspective of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, as well as from healthcare information technology (IT) standards, such as the ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001 family. Because a security risk management process that narrowly focuses on the traditional “physical injury or damage” definition may limit the scope of security risk mitigation, this document incorporates the broader considerations that risks include effects outside the traditional scope of patient physical harm and may include “reduction of effectiveness” and “breach of data and systems security” as extended in the ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001 family of standards.

While safety risk involves evaluating the probability and severity of a hazard leading to harm, security risk is based on an assessment of the likelihood that a threat will successfully exploit a device vulnerability, an event that could lead to an adverse impact due to a compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. This loosely parallels the concepts of probability and severity described in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971. Organizations should exercise caution when attempting to quantify likelihood of a future adverse impact in traditional probabilistic terms. Instead, they should focus on the skills and motivations of an attacker, and whether the effort required to exploit a vulnerability is less than the perceived gain the attacker will achieve by compromising the system (see B.2.1.1). Security is an emergent property of a system. As such, the security of a device needs to be considered in the context of the broader system. This document directs manufacturers to understand, evaluate, and document the operating environment of a device so security risks are evaluated in their operational context. It is recognized that the manufacturer cannot ensure aspects of this operating environment that are outside the manufacturer’s control. However, it is incumbent on the manufacturer to understand the methods that Health Delivery Organizations (HDOs) x © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016use to manage the risks of networked medical devices as specified in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80001-1, as well as the methods used to communicate cybersecurity needs, risks, and controls as documented in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80001-2-2. Manufacturers should understand the concept of a Responsibility Agreement1 that may be negotiated with the purchasing HDO, and be prepared to communicate any specific security expectations of the network that the device is connected to through methods such as the HIMSS/NEMA Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). Manufacturers should also recognize that a poorly secured and updated device could be a source of security vulnerability to other computing systems and other devices to which the device is connected, directly or on a shared network. Such a device can be used as a “pivot” to attack other systems and devices. A reasonable expectation of organizations deploying the device is that such risks have been considered and appropriately mitigated.  As a result, this document uses the broader definition of risk as used in the ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001 family of standards. Manufacturers that follow the recommendations of this report should consider those risks that come from outside the device, mitigate those that are feasible, and document the expectations of the organization that becomes responsible for integrating the device into a broader network.  The framework described in this document is presented as a companion process to the safety risk management requirements of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971. This is similar to the risk management approach documented in ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62366-1:2015 for usability engineering. The key to successful integration of a device security risk management process into the larger risk management process is to bring together personnel with expertise in traditional device development, human factors, and cybersecurity product development. This collaboration will be essential to the ultimate goal of developing secure medical devices.   1 Responsibility Agreements are described in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80001-1. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  xi                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016  xii © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016AAMI Technical Information Report AAMI TIR57:2016 Principles for medical device security – Risk management  1 Scope This TIR provides guidance for addressing information security within the risk management framework defined by ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971.  This guidance is intended to assist manufacturers and other users of the standard in the following:  identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and assets associated with medical devices;  estimating and evaluating associated security risks;  controlling security risks; and  monitoring effectiveness of the risk controls. This document is based on an application of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 with an expanded consideration of the possible impacts that a security compromise can have on the medical device, people, the environment, the manufacturer, and the information processed and stored by the device. This report also incorporates several principles from NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]), a security risk management process developed for traditional IT systems. The guidance provided by this document is applicable to all stages of the life-cycle of a medical device. 2 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply: 2.1 asset person, structure, facility, information, and records, information technology systems and resources, material, process, relationships, or reputation that has value [SOURCE: NICCS Glossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology – As accessed on June 15, 2015.] 2.2 authentication verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system [SOURCE: SP 800-53; SP 800-53A; SP 800-27; FIPS 200; SP 800-30] 2.3 authenticity property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator (see Authentication) [SOURCE: SP 800-53; SP 800-53A; CNSSI-4009; SP 800-39] 2.4 authorization access privileges granted to a user, program, or process, or the act of granting those privileges [SOURCE: CNSSI-4009] © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  1 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20162.5 availability ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information NOTE 1 to entry: The phrase “use of information” encompasses delivery of intended functionality.

Security risk management should follow a similar path, as illustrated in Figure 3. While organizations may choose to incorporate security risks into their general safety risk management process, this document recommends the creation of a separate risk analysis process focused specifically on impacts that are identified by a security analysis. Because harm, as defined in this document, may include breach of data and system security and reduction in device effectiveness (as defined in ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-1), it is more appropriate to create a companion security risk management process to allow the organization to assess the additional risks associated with effectiveness and system/data security. If the processes are integrated, there could be an inclination to drop the evaluation of those risks that do not lead to harm as narrowly defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, which can lead to incomplete or inconsistent security controls. This segregation is further supported by the fact that security risk assessment models typically use assessment factors that are different from the model described by ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971. In addition, integrating safety and security risk assessment into a single general risk management process may result in major modifications to a well-functioning safety risk management process. Security risks that impact safety, according to the definition of harm in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 (“physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment”), should also be captured in the organization’s safety risk management process. It is recognized that treatment of risk in these two risk assessment models, safety risk assessment and security risk assessment, may differ. A specific risk assessed as “must mitigate” in one model might be assessed as “does not need further mitigation” in the other. Risk control measure(s) should be applied to bring the risk into the acceptable range in both assessment models.        © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  5 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016                    Figure 3 - Schematic representation of the security risk management process 3.1.1 Relationship between security and safety risk management This document recommends that manufacturers establish a companion security risk management process to their existing ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971-based safety risk management process. The requirements of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 indicate that all hazards need to be managed through the safety risk management process – including those hazards that result from security compromises. However, because the definition of “harm” in this document is broader than the definition used in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, there will be risks managed in the security risk assessment that are not propagated to the safety risk management process. An example would be a risk of compromise of the confidentiality of protected health information that is not considered harm in the context of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, but clearly requires mitigation by the security risk management process. There are also business and reputation risks associated with a security compromise that are not considered harm in the safety sense.  When security risks may lead to safety risks, security and safety staff should work jointly to contribute to the security risk analysis and transfer safety related hazards to the safety analysis. An example of a security risk that is also a safety risk is a malicious attacker gaining access to a medical device’s code, altering that code, and causing the device to malfunction. This malfunction may have the potential to cause harm to the patient. However, when a security risk does not involve safety risk, personnel qualified in security are typically sufficient for risk analysis. An example of a security risk that is not a safety risk is a malicious attacker who gains access to patient data. The patient data obtained poses a security risk but does not directly affect safety.  Because the security controls that mitigate safety risks caused by security compromise may simultaneously mitigate non-safety related security risks, it is logical to manage all security risks in a single process. That is, a security compromise that leads to harm (as more narrowly defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971) should be managed within the security risk management process and propagated for assessment using the organization’s safety risk management process.  6 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016As illustrated in Figure 4, when a risk control measure is introduced to a design, the design must be reassessed to determine if the control measure introduces a new form of risk. It should be recognized that there is a coupling between safety and security risk assessment processes, so when control measures are introduced for one type of risk (e.g., safety), the manufacturer needs to assess the impact on the other type of risk (e.g., security) and vice versa. For example, the decision to add risk control measures for authentication might introduce risks that the device cannot be accessed in an emergency. The overall risk management process should identify those points of coupling and ensure that assessment of any newly identified source of risk is performed in both domains. This is illustrated in Figure 4, showing the logical connection points between the security and safety risk management processes.   Figure 4 – Relationships between the security risk and safety risk management processes Typically, these assessments iterate between the security and safety risk management processes. Figure 4 shows an example of one such iteration. 3.2 Management responsibilities Top management should provide adequate and qualified personnel (see 3.3) to perform the security risk management process. In addition, top management needs to define and document the policy for determining the criteria for security risk acceptability, including criteria for non-safety related security risks, such as business and reputation risks. This policy should ensure that criteria are based upon applicable national or regional regulations and relevant international standards, and take into account available information, such as the generally accepted state of the art for security risk management and known stakeholder security concerns. Stakeholders include medical practitioners, Health Delivery Organizations (HDOs), governments, industry, patients, and members of the public. Top management should ensure that the organization implements a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy so security researchers and others have a means to communicate vulnerabilities identified in fielded devices.  Top management should review the suitability of the security risk management process at planned intervals to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the process, and they should document any decisions and actions taken.  © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  7 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20163.3 Qualification of personnel Persons performing security risk management tasks need to have the knowledge and experience appropriate to the tasks assigned to them. These should include knowledge of the particular medical device (or similar medical device) and its intended use, operating environments, security risk control technologies, and the risk management process.  Personnel should be knowledgeable in evaluating security threats and vulnerabilities, and be aware of past and emerging changes in the security risk landscape, both for medical devices, as well as general purpose computing systems. The team performing security risk management tasks should have experience with hardware and software architecture, design, and security test methods. Appropriate qualification records should be maintained.  3.4 Security risk management plan Security risk management should be incorporated into the manufacturer’s risk management process. As discussed in 3.1, this document recommends that the security risk management process be maintained as a companion process to the safety risk management process. Because the two processes exchange information on the identified risks and candidate risk controls, the risk management plans for the two processes should be coordinated. However, it is acceptable for a manufacturer to incorporate the security risk management plan as part of the overall risk management plan developed in compliance with ISO 14971. The scope of risk management activities includes the identification of the medical device features and life-cycle phases where security risks need to be managed. To properly determine the scope of security risk management activities, the medical device must be assessed to determine which features expose a potential security risk based on the intended use and operating environment. Because threats change over time and new vulnerabilities in operating systems, middleware and components are discovered on regular basis, security risks are frequently identified after a device is released to the market. Consequently, as threats evolve, it is critical to have a plan for post-market monitoring, reporting, analyzing, and responding to newly identified threats and vulnerabilities. The criteria for risk evaluation, impact assessment, and residual risk acceptability should be documented in the plan. Because a vulnerability requires exploitation before harm can occur, there is a behavioral aspect to risk estimation that is not amenable to mathematical probability estimation. Because vulnerability requires exploitation before harm can occur, and exploitation involves human behavior, risk estimation is not amenable to mathematical probability estimation. Top management plays a critical role in defining a policy for determining the criteria for security risk acceptability (see 3.2). The plan should describe the methodology for security risk verification. Some possible alternatives include the following: a) verification testing of security controls that mitigate risks, including effectiveness of the mitigation; b) robustness testing (e.g., “fuzz testing”); c) penetration testing (typically performed in a production equivalent or final configured state). Manufacturers should also document any additional development methodologies that should be applied to reduce the likelihood of unintended functionality being present in the code that could become a vulnerability once deployed. This may include code analysis (e.g., inspections, static code checking) or particular verification testing strategies to increase confidence in the robustness of the implementation.  Consideration should be given to appropriate security testing for the intended use and operating environment (e.g., physical and network). The security risk management plan should address how components (hardware and software) will be monitored for security performance and how vulnerabilities identified in those components are elevated for risk evaluation in the component’s use in the finished medical device. Sources of information on new vulnerabilities for components include threat intelligence, reports from suppliers and the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list. The plan should ensure that mechanisms for post-market cybersecurity surveillance of all third-party components will be identified. The plan should describe how product security performance information will be collected in fielded devices and reported back to the manufacturer for assessment and potential control. The plan should reference the organization’s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy as an additional input source.  The security risk management plan should include the requirements for an appropriate review interval for newly identified threats and vulnerabilities. 8 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016NOTE See Clause 9 for additional guidance on recommended post-market surveillance activities and methods. Manufacturers should plan for the appropriate disclosure of identified vulnerabilities.  Manufacturers should plan for a secure and efficient software update process to manage vulnerabilities in fielded devices and enable prompt response when required.  3.5 Security risk management file The security risk management file may be integrated with the overall risk management file or be maintained separately.  The security risk management file should contain, at a minimum, the following:  a) security risk management plan; b) security risk analysis components, such as: 1) intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse; 2) qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the system that could affect the security of the medical device and, where appropriate, their defined limits; and 3) risk controls and their implementation and verification; c) security risk controls (typically captured and flowed down as system requirements specifications). 4 Security risk analysis 4.1 Security risk analysis process Security risk analysis should be performed for the medical device as described in 4.2 to 4.4. The results of the security risk analysis should be recorded in the security risk management file. Security needs to be assessed in the context of the larger system in which the device operates. The security risk analysis needs to consider the intended use and document the anticipated operating environment for which the device was designed and tested. The security architecture (see A.6) includes the complete operating environment of the device, as well as other important factors. These steps will facilitate communication to end user(s) responsible for device configuration. If a security risk analysis, or other relevant information, is available for a similar medical device, then that analysis or information can be used as a starting point for the new analysis. The degree of relevance depends on the differences between the devices and whether these introduce new risks or significant vulnerability differences. The extent of reuse should be based on a systematic evaluation of the effects the changes have on exposing the patients, users, and manufacturer to additional risks. In addition to the records recommended in 4.2 to 4.4, the documentation of the conduct and results of the security risk analysis should include at least the following: a) a description and identification of the medical device that was analyzed; b) identification of the person(s) and organization carrying out the security risk analysis; and c) scope and date(s) of the security risk analysis. 4.2 Intended use and identification of characteristics related to the security of the medical device For the particular medical device being considered, the manufacturer should document the intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse. Reasonably foreseeable misuse should include efforts that normal users might make to circumvent security controls when they are perceived as preventing their use of the device. NOTE 1 In this context, misuse is intended to mean incorrect or improper use of the medical device. NOTE 2 The exploration of potential malicious abuse by attackers will be accomplished during the threat analysis activity documented in 4.3. NOTE 3 Annex D contains questions that can serve as a useful guide in identifying medical device characteristics that could have an impact on security. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  9 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016The manufacturer should document the assumed operating environment and security architecture for which the device is designed to operate, along with any assumptions on external security controls that must be provided by the end user. This documentation should be maintained in the security risk management file. HDOs may have different and varying cybersecurity needs, risks and controls depending on the budget and sophistication of the organization. The manufacturer should perform a needs assessment with a representative sample of HDOs prior to initiating product design. The manufacturer should document characteristics of the system that rely on user configuration to ensure the security of the device. The device’s intended use and the experience level of the intended users should be understood to more accurately understand the likelihood of proper configuration by the end user. The risk analysis should address characteristics of the device and its expected operating environment (physical and IT). For example, the risk analysis should consider whether the device is mobile and/or expected to be physically accessible to unauthorized users. Interoperability requirements and constraints of the operating environment should also be considered and documented. For medical devices that use wireless technology with a discovery mode or similar active connection mode, the manufacturer should implement appropriate technical controls to prevent unauthorized users from sensing or connecting to the medical device. In some cases, a manufacturer may document recommended compensating controls for implementation in the user environment. 4.3 Identification of threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and adverse impacts In order to assess security risk, several factors need to be identified and documented. The analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and adverse impacts can be performed in any order and may require participants with different skills and experiences. For example, understanding the adverse impacts may require members with deeper clinical understanding of the device’s intended use, while the understanding of threats and their characteristics will require members with deeper security backgrounds.  This is expected to be an iterative process where continued brainstorming and discussion results in new aspects of the medical device being identified that could be affected by additional threats and vulnerabilities. The conclusion of the process is expected to provide a carefully considered and extensive listing of threats, vulnerabilities, and adverse impacts that feeds into the next step of estimating the risks. NOTE See Annex B for examples of threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and adverse impacts. 4.3.1 Identification of threats When assessing risk, special consideration should be given to threat actor capability and the benefits they might gain from a potential exploit. The risk analysis should document potential threats and the means a threat actor might use to exploit a vulnerability.  Threats can be identified using information from a variety of sources, including the manufacturer’s IT security department, as well as from the security departments of key customers (e.g., large hospitals or clinics where the devices may be deployed). Information should also be gathered from reports of threats that have been experienced by the healthcare system, and from similar adjacent domains, such as industrial control systems. Governmental agencies, such as ICS-CERT, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Organizations (ISAOs), exist for the purpose of sharing this information. Information from third-party security information aggregators may also be helpful in gaining a thorough understanding of threat actors, their capabilities, and typical means of creating a threat event. NOTE See Annex D and Annex E in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) for additional material regarding threat identification.  4.3.2 Identification of vulnerabilities The risk analysis should document known and potential vulnerabilities in the device. Vulnerabilities come from three distinct sources. First, vulnerabilities may be introduced by conscious design decisions, such as whether to include a security control or allow its bypass (e.g., in emergency access situations). The second source of vulnerabilities is from errors in the design, implementation, manufacture, or configuration of the device, by the manufacturer, their suppliers, or end users. These design errors are cases where the device does not meet the intent of the designers through a process deficiency. A third source of vulnerabilities is from a design characteristic that at the time of design release was not known to be a vulnerability, but subsequent to design release, a means of exploiting the design characteristic for malicious purposes was discovered. When assessing risk, special consideration should be given to the exploitability of the vulnerability (i.e., the capability necessary for a threat actor to exploit the vulnerability). Vulnerabilities can be identified by incorporating top-down analysis methodologies (e.g. attack trees, threat modelling) to identify ways that a threat can cause loss of security properties for the device. Standards such as ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/201680001-2-2 list security capabilities, and this information can also identify potential vulnerabilities in the requirements. The identification process is best started early in the concept phase of the device development lifecycle but should also be applied to products in advanced stages of development or already in service.  Identification of possible points where a design/implementation error may introduce a vulnerability can be initiated with an analysis of the system to determine system nodes (components and users) and communication pathways. Once these are known for a system, they can be assessed for potential vulnerabilities that can affect each of these nodes and/or communication links. Various sources of information may also be used to identify vulnerabilities of the system under review. These sources include knowledge gained from past products, academic publications, industry news sources, independent security firms, independent research, and future projections. In addition, security testing (e.g., vulnerability scanning and penetration testing) may be used in early design phases to assist in identifying potential vulnerabilities. It is critical that the team performing the security risk assessment be knowledgeable on these and other pertinent sources of information so that a comprehensive and realistic identification of threats and vulnerabilities occurs. NOTE See Annex F in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) for additional material regarding vulnerabilities.  4.3.3 Identification of assets Document the assets of the device. Assets can include information (e.g. patient data, diagnostic data, therapy parameters) the device itself, or components of the device including the device software. Assets may also be the physical interfaces to the device, in particular connections to external networks which could present risks to other systems on the network if unprotected at the device level. Asset identification can be done through a systematic process, looking at each asset on the device and any interface that could be manipulated by an attacker. Asset identification should include those assets needed by the user to manage, diagnose, and treat the patient, as well as on those assets required to keep the device operating safely and securely. The process should consider assets needed to maintain the device or any used as part of post-market surveillance. Particular attention should be afforded to any stored authentication or cryptographic credentials that are used by the device, as their compromise could lead to the subsequent compromise of many other assets. 4.3.4 Identification of adverse impacts For each identified asset, consider the impact that loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity, or loss of availability might have on safety, effectiveness, or data or system security.  Impact of asset compromise involves examining each asset and answering at least the following questions: a) What is the impact if that asset’s confidentiality was compromised, and the information it contained was available to an attacker?  b) What is the impact if that asset’s integrity was compromised, and an attacker could change the information or software in a way that wasn’t immediately obvious to the user (clinician or patient)? c) What is the impact if that asset could be made unavailable? d) Could the immediate impact of an asset compromise lead to another type of attack or vulnerability? NOTE See Annex F in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) for additional material regarding impact assessment. 4.4 Estimation of the risk(s) for each applicable threat and vulnerability combination In the NIST SP800-30 Revision 1 model (see Bibliography [53]), security risk is estimated by a combination of the threat, vulnerability, and impact of asset compromise. When compared to the safety risk analysis process, the combination of threat and vulnerability is analogous to the probability of occurrence. The impact of asset compromise is analogous to the severity of harm.  The device manufacturer should establish a documented and repeatable risk estimation process that allows the security risk to be evaluated for acceptability. While the measures for the individual factors may be qualitative, it should be possible for subject matter experts to agree on the valuations of each factor, and the process by which they are combined results in a ranking of risk that can be used to decide which risks require further mitigation.  The outcome of this activity depends on the method employed by the manufacturer, but it is expected to be in the form of a ranking or grouping of the threats and vulnerabilities with possible additional details provided on rationale for the scoring. NOTE See Annex G, H and I in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) for additional material regarding risk estimation. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  11 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20165 Security risk evaluation Each identified risk needs to be evaluated for whether security risk reduction is required, according to the criteria documented in the security risk management plan. Each risk should also be evaluated to determine if a risk must be promoted to the safety risk file for analysis. As discussed in 3.1, security risks that can lead to hazardous situations need to be assessed in the safety risk analysis as well. The risk level should be mitigated (i.e., risk controlled) to an acceptable level in both analyses. If reduction is determined to not be required, the manufacturer should document the rationale behind that decision and what changes in the threat environment would trigger reevaluation. 6 Risk control 6.1 Security risk reduction Paralleling ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, when security risk reduction is required, the risk control activities in this clause should be performed.  6.2 Security risk control option analysis Manufacturers should use a security risk control hierarchy that parallels the safety hierarchy presented in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971. Risk control options in order of preference are listed below: a) Inherent security by design - Inherent security by design may include options, such as preventing access and/or modification of device settings from other systems or over the networked interface, implementation of secure certificates for authentication and code signing, incorporation of defense-in-depth, and various hardening mechanisms. b) Protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process - Examples of protective measures include requiring physical proximity, ensuring that malware detection is part of the software manufacturing and deployment process, and the addition of intrusion detection systems to detect attempted attacks. c) Information for security - Information for security would include documenting security requirements that are placed on the entity or individual patient that connects the device directly to other systems or integrates the device on a network. Just as labeling for safety is considered a weak mitigation, leveraging excessive requirements on the network configuration to ensure security is least desirable, as one cannot be assured that all networks will be so configured, and it raises the potential that different devices on the same network are subject to incompatible requirements. Manufacturers should be aware of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80001-1 concept of Responsibility Agreements and be prepared to supply the HIMSS/NEMA Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2) to those users of networked devices that request this document. Manufacturers should consider the ability to respond to future unknown security risks as a key risk control measure, as there may be unknown vulnerabilities present in the designed medical device that become known as threats become more sophisticated. This includes the ability to securely deliver patches after the device is in service.  If, during risk control option analysis, the manufacturer determines the required security risk reduction is not practicable, the manufacturer should conduct a risk/benefit analysis of the residual risk (see 6.5).  6.3 Implementation of risk control measure(s) The security risk control measures selected need to be implemented and verified with the results recorded in the security risk management file. These control measures will typically be expressed as testable requirements. Annex C provides guidance on documenting security requirements. 6.4 Residual risk evaluation Residual risk is re-evaluated after the security risk controls have been applied. A risk control measure may mitigate either the threat, vulnerability, or impact. This should be documented to reflect the residual risk estimation. Further risk controls may need to be applied if the residual risk is unacceptable. Manufacturers need to determine what information about acceptable residual risks should be disclosed in the device labeling.  12 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20166.5 Risk/benefit analysis Security risks that impact safety will need to be evaluated against the manufacturer’s acceptability criteria for their safety risk management process per ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971. For security risks that do not impact safety, the decision not to mitigate may be more appropriately rationalized with a cost/benefit analysis.  If security residual risk is considered unacceptable, a risk/benefit analysis should be performed. The manufacturer should appropriately balance the residual security risk against the benefit that might be gained by the design capability or security control. For example, a conditionally unacceptable risk of exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) [74] should not be deemed acceptable, because the device delivers life-saving therapy. In this example the benefit of having PII stored in the device should be compared to the risk of confidentiality loss.  If analysis determined that the security risks are outweighed by the benefits, the manufacturer should determine what information should be communicated in the device labeling to manage this residual risk. This needs to be communicated in such a way that it does not provide a blueprint for a potential attacker to exploit the non-mitigated vulnerability. NOTE “Security by obscurity” is not considered a valid risk reduction method. Undisclosed vulnerabilities may ultimately be discovered, which could result in elevated risk (due to increased likelihood of exploit) forcing corrective action post-deployment, if the manufacturer becomes aware of the discovery. Because there is always the potential that the discovery can be hidden from the manufacturer, unmitigated vulnerabilities that have high adverse impact carry significant residual risk.  6.6 Risks arising from risk control measures The manufacturer should seek to balance usability, device safety, and device security to ensure that the security controls are appropriate for the intended users and any systems to which the device is connected. Related decisions and trade-offs should be documented. It is possible that new risks of harm could be unintentionally added to the system due to the implementation of security controls (e.g., use of password authentication which adds unacceptable delay in accessing the device during an emergency). Each proposed security risk control should be analyzed for the potential of introducing new safety and security risks.  The manufacturer should consider whether there could be impacts on patient compliance and device effectiveness due to changes in device usability. Utilizing human factors experts in this process remains an important and critical part of a balanced assessment.  6.7 Completeness of risk control Manufacturers should ensure that the risk(s) from all identified threats, vulnerabilities, and potentially compromised assets have been considered and the implemented controls are comprehensive in addressing them. Record the results in the security risk management file.  A security controls assessment should be performed, based on a security control set derived from customer requirements, regional compliance expectations, and industry best practices. From the security control set, appropriate security controls can be selected based on device functionality and operating environment. The selected controls can then be evaluated to determine whether they are sufficient. Missing security controls may indicate vulnerabilities and threats not previously considered, resulting in a return to the security risk analysis step (see 4.1).  A security controls assessment can also be performed as part of security risk analysis. This would create an additional mechanism for the discovery of vulnerabilities earlier in the assessment process. 7 Evaluation of overall residual security risk acceptability Clause 7 of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 requires that the overall residual risk be evaluated against the criteria stated in the risk management plan. Just as there are complexities in evaluating the overall residual safety risk (see Clause 6 in ANSI/AAMI/ISO TIR 24971:2013), determining overall residual security risk is difficult. The impacts of various potential security exploits vary according to different severities, and the means to estimate how likely it is that a threat actor will exploit a vulnerability and cause adverse impact can be variable as well.  Another complexity is that the overall residual risk acceptability may vary by the nature of the adverse impact. A manufacturer may choose to establish overall residual risk criteria that address different acceptable overall residual risk levels for direct physical harm (i.e., causing harm to the patient that is due to interaction with the device) versus loss of effectiveness versus loss of data or systems security. Generally accepted security practices should be considered as part of the residual risk acceptability decision-making process. The manufacturer should employ security testing (e.g., vulnerability scanning and penetration testing) as a means to aid in the assessment of overall residual security risk. However, it should be noted that such negative testing is © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  13 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016minimally conclusive. Passing a penetration test does not indicate that a device is invulnerable, but that it resisted the forms of attacks represented by that specific penetration test suite at that specific test date.  For an overall residual risk that is judged acceptable, the manufacturer should decide which documentation regarding information security is necessary to include in the accompanying documents in order to manage the overall residual risk. 8 Security risk management report A security risk management report summarizes the evaluation, assessment, mitigation activities, and traceability to the verification reports of security controls that ensure a device is reasonably secure. This report should provide references to the detailed plans and reports for readers seeking additional information. The report should be periodically updated as new threats, vulnerabilities, assets, or adverse impacts are discovered, and as post-market information becomes available. At a minimum, the security risk management report should provide, either directly or by reference, the following items: a) Risk analysis, mitigations, and design considerations pertaining to cybersecurity risks. Consider including the following: 1) system description including intended use; 2) description of the operating environment; 3) assets; 4) vulnerabilities; 5) impact of asset compromise; and 6) security risk controls. b) A traceability matrix of security risks to security controls.  c) Traceability to the verification reports for documented security controls. d) A description of when and how security updates/patches will be provided. e) A description of the steps taken to assure devices will be delivered malware-free. Prior to release for commercial distribution of the medical device, the manufacturer should carry out a review of the security risk management process. This review should assure at least the following:   The security risk management plan has been appropriately implemented.   The overall residual security risk is acceptable.  Appropriate methods are in place to obtain relevant production and post-production security information. 9 Production and post-production information Manufacturers should be monitoring, collecting, and reviewing information about the operating environment for the medical device during production and post-production phases. Monitoring should include the time period from when the medical device is submitted for regulatory approval and before the product is released. During the production phase, manufacturers should be monitoring that devices are being produced in a manner that avoids the introduction of unintended functionality (e.g., malware) into the device that could affect the performance of the device, or serve as a threat to other devices to which it may be connected in the operating environment.  During the post-production phase, manufacturers should have in place means to monitor whether fielded devices are being exposed to security threats and whether the implemented security controls are effective in mitigating those threats. This is typically done through the creation of a security log that is secured from tampering. The manufacturer should consider the mechanisms used by the operator, end user, or those responsible for installation, use, and maintenance of the device for collecting, processing, and communicating this monitoring data.  The manufacturer should also monitor security information from the supply chain providing hardware and software components for the medical device. A means should also be established to accept reporting of potential device 14 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016vulnerabilities from non-indicated users (e.g., security researchers) and to monitor reports of identified vulnerabilities in similar devices from the same or other manufacturers.  The collected information should be evaluated for possible relevance to device security and possible impacts on patient harm, with particular focus on the following:  emergence of new classes of threats;  identification of previously unrecognized vulnerabilities, or new methods of exploiting existing vulnerabilities; and  a change in the previously estimated risk level for a known vulnerability. If any of these conditions occur, the impact on the previously implemented risk management activities should be evaluated and a review of the risk management file for the medical device should be conducted. The manufacturer should also evaluate if there is a change in the assessed residual risk and the acceptability of that residual risk. These results should be recorded in the risk management file.  Because the threat environment can change without specific new events being captured by surveillance mechanisms, manufacturers should plan for a periodic review of the security of their medical device as documented in the security risk management plan.  Manufacturers should also ensure that they maintain the capability to respond to security issues for the expected life of the fielded devices. This capability could include software patches available for download to mitigate vulnerabilities discovered during post market surveillance activities. Vulnerabilities identified by or reported to a medical device manufacturer should be disclosed to appropriate stakeholders within a reasonable timeframe as established by the organization’s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy. These disclosures are not restricted to vulnerabilities which have an identified patch or field change. Expedited disclosure may be needed to facilitate control of unacceptable security risk. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  15 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Annex A (informative) Security engineering principles and nomenclature A.1 Overview Good system engineering practices should be applied to security engineering. They represent a robust approach to the design, creation, and operation of systems and include these steps:  identification and quantification of system goals;  creation of alternative system design concepts;   evaluation of design trade-offs;  selection and implementation of the best design;  verification that the design is properly built and integrated; and  post-implementation assessment of how well the system meets (or met) the goals The complexity of medical device systems and the security risks from unintended emergent system behaviors requires the use of good system engineering practices throughout the product lifecycle. Medical devices present unique and challenging demands and constraints on the security architecture. Most of the differentiating characteristics between conventional IT and a medical device arise because medical devices require the following:  risk benefit analysis and the context of use;  focus on hazard analysis;  testing that focuses on minimizing risk of injury or damage; and  clinical implications of security-sensitive software updates These constraints often impact security attributes and create unique challenges as outlined in Table A.1. 16 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Table A.1 – Examples of security attributes and comparison between conventional IT and a medical device Security Attribute Conventional IT Medical Device Access No access without credential Emergency access possible without credentials Access management Centralized Localized to patient Accessibility Typically accessible Intermittent accessibility and may be inaccessible  Product lifecycle Constant flow of new and revised products Device or platform used for decades Computing resources Vast and expandable Sometimes limited and/or severely power-constrained Updates and monitoring Continuous connectivity and less likely to require end-to-end validation More likely to require end-to-end validation Consequences Economic Safety A.2 Uniqueness of embedded medical systems Embedded systems are typically resource constrained, yet must satisfy manufacturing cost, development cost, reliability, power, safety, and security requirements. Although many embedded systems are non-standard or proprietary, they are not innately secure. There are a variety of possible attacks on embedded systems. Different defenses are needed when the attacker has physical access to the system. With physical access, the attacker is no longer restricted to using communication ports. It may be necessary to provide hardware security in the form of conformal coatings, blind and buried traces, non-heat-sensitive glue, and other techniques that force the attacker to damage the product if they attempt to reverse engineer the design. Tamper-evident seals are useful for attacks against individual devices that may be left in place after modification. A number of techniques may be used to increase the difficulty of reverse engineering and exploitation of an embedded system, such as the following:   disabling unused communication interfaces;  limiting physical access to communication interfaces;  activating security fuses or other protection mechanisms;  proper use of firmware encryption; and   disabling unused firmware components. Embedded system security considerations should be taken into account early in the design process and throughout the product development lifecycle. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  17 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016A.3 Stakeholders Stakeholders have a valid interest in the system and may be affected by it either directly or indirectly. Stakeholders often include:  anyone who operates the system;  anyone who benefits from the system;  anyone involved in maintenance of the system;  anyone involved in administration of the system;  anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system;  organizations that regulate aspects of the system; and  organizations responsible for systems that interface with the system. A.3.1 Patients, family, friends, and caregivers Patients benefit directly from the therapy or diagnostic information the devices provide. They want their therapy to improve their quality of life without adding stress or fear from the potential risk of a security-related event. Also, there are trends toward increased patient engagement in their care that can cause the inclusion of new features with potential security impacts. For home-based medical devices, there may be others (e.g., caregivers) who support the patient and work with the medical device. A.3.2 Regulators Regulatory agencies wish to protect the common good of those they serve. They are less concerned with the survival of a business than with the effectiveness and safety of the medical therapies.  A.3.3 Health Delivery Organizations (HDOs) HDOs look for the most effective methods to provide care for their patients. Systems with lower cost and lower risk are more attractive. An increased security burden and related events may decrease the attractiveness of a system. A.3.4 Manufacturers Manufacturers take into account business constraints while addressing the needs of patients and customers. Security can create additional burden and expense. Excessive burden can turn away customers and make systems overly cumbersome and expensive. The business desires effective security solutions that enhance product value in excess of its cost. A.3.5 Academics Academia seeks to learn and publish new information. Their goal may be to influence regulation, obtain research funding, or employment. A.3.6 Cyber Liability Insurers Cyber liability insurance companies are beginning to better quantify cybersecurity risks and will likely drive economic incentives to improve cybersecurity when there is potential for financial loss. A.4 Security objectives and goals The overarching goals of a safety risk process are safety, effectiveness, and maintaining essential performance (as defined by ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1:2005/(R)2012) of the medical device. Security adds the following additional primary objectives:  confidentiality;  integrity (includes authenticity and non-repudiation);  availability. 18 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016The preceding primary security objectives may be further broken down into more specific sub-objectives:   ensuring that data is not improperly altered;  ensuring alarm limits are not altered where alteration may make the device unsafe;  ensuring the identity of authorized user is known so important actions may be logged and attributable to a user (accountability)—in some cases this objective may be partially achieved through physical access controls;  ensuring the integrity of audit security audit logs to prevent tampering. Annex D contains a set of questions that can be used to help define the requirements for medical device security architecture.  Basic security objectives can be met only when the design addresses a comprehensive set of use scenarios that include abuse cases, misuse, system constraints, the needs of all stakeholders, and the operating environment. The manufacturer should also recognize that the threat landscape is constantly evolving and establish processes for monitoring and performing periodic review of the security architecture to assure it continues to be effective.  A.5 Considerations for emergency access Emergency device access may mean HDOs need to have access without a prior relationship with the patient or the medical device. The attending physician or health care professional expects to obtain immediate access to the medical device in an emergency scenario. Specific techniques for emergency access include location-controlled access, limited communications capability in an emergency mode, access logging, secondary communications protocols for emergency access, and proximal communications techniques (i.e., very short-range - e.g., centimeters). Proximal communications is one way of establishing trust, because it is common medical practice and it allows the patient to be engaged in the trust-establishment procedure. Therefore, it may be acceptable for communication systems using proximal techniques to rely on physical security in a limited-access operating environment (e.g., temporarily disabling mechanisms for confidentiality and authentication). Positive initiation of emergency access and subsequent logging of the event are important to deter abuse.  A.6 Medical device security architecture considerations A security architecture should include categorized assets, security controls, threat agents, major functional blocks, communications paths and protocols, trust zones or chokepoints, data flows, and interactions with external systems. Components of a security architecture should include but are not limited to, the following:  Actors – individuals or systems that interact with the data, protected data, and security controls, their capabilities, needs, limitations, constraints, etc.;  Data – the information that passes through the security model, whether protected or not, whether at rest or in motion;  Data protection mechanisms – access control and integrity protection;  Hardware security blocks – trusted hardware, function, and limitations;  Untrusted hardware – any hardware to which an attacker is likely to gain access;   Trusted software/firmware;  Untrusted software/firmware;  Data use – how data is used. (e.g., user workflows, use scenarios);  Patient – the recipient of medical care;  Location – location of where a particular medical device is intended to be used – for example, whether © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  19 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016hospital-based or mobile (as with an implantable device); and  Other assets that need to be secured. These entities are expressed in architectural views that are selected to best communicate the architecture. Possible views include the following:  architectural overview;   physical;   functional;   information;   concurrency;   software implementation;   process;   sequential;   logical;   technology;   deployment; and  operational. Many manufacturers create their own systems consisting of several devices that evolve on separate timelines. There are unique architecture considerations in this situation. A new product added to an existing system can have a positive or negative impact. The new product can impact both the device manufacturer and the healthcare delivery organization. Potential impacts include the following:  Enhancement: A new product feature may enhance the security architecture by taking advantage of unused capability (e.g., the system supports signed firmware updates, present products do not, but the new product does).  Planning: A new feature may position a new product to take advantage of security architecture growth (e.g., the new product can use signed messages for remote programming, but the system does not yet support the feature).  Reduction in security: The new product may negatively impact the current security architecture if it does not support a security architecture feature (e.g., the security architecture and existing products supports encrypted communications but the new product does not as documented in FIPS 140-2).  Neglect: The new product may negatively impact future security growth (e.g., the future security architecture will include security logging, but the new device does not support the capability). Security assessments on products consider not only the present state, but also address the projected future state of the complete system. A platform that does not allow for incremental improvement as new products are released will not be viewed as favorably as one that does accommodate security improvements. It is important that the security architecture be broad and open-ended. Not all future added components need to be understood today, but it is important to know that the security architecture will support growth towards the desired future state. 20 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Annex B (informative) Security risk assessment As discussed in Clause 4, security risk management requires the identification, analysis and evaluation of all potential security risks, so appropriate design decisions can be made on which risks require mitigating controls, and which risks can be accepted and monitored for changes that may require re-assessment. This annex provides supporting detail on assessment techniques that may be applied to perform the steps of security risk analysis and evaluation.  No single security risk assessment methodology is applicable to all medical device manufacturers without tailoring, but all good methodologies must do the following:  provide a consistent means to assess and reason about security risk across the organization;  avoid assessment factors that rely on “gut judgment” in favor of those that can be evaluated dispassionately;  allow the organization to clearly rank risks and identify those that are acceptable, conditionally acceptable, and unacceptable; and  enable comparison between “traditional” safety risks and the risks associated with a security vulnerability so that the organization can apply resources to mitigate the overall highest set of risks. Security controls implemented after this comparison should be verifiable. While there are several security risk assessment processes available, most of them have been developed for IT systems, including web-based services. The most commonly used process is the one documented in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments (see Bibliography [53]). Indeed, many of the other published assessment processes can be mapped to the NIST standard. This TIR follows the basic outline of that NIST standard, with specific emphasis on how it should be connected to the 14971-based safety risk management process required for medical devices. Manufacturers who are developing an internal security risk management process are encouraged to read NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) thoroughly, as it contains many useful recommendations that are not replicated here. In addition, the manufacturer should consult applicable regulatory guidance such as the FDA’s Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices (see Bibliography [17]) when defining their security risk assessment activities.  Manufacturers should define a security risk assessment methodology consisting of these four steps: a) Define the risk assessment process to be used, including the steps. b) Define an explicit risk model, including which risk factors will be assessed and the relationships between risk factors. c) Define the assessment approach (quantitative, qualitative, or semi-qualitative), ranges of values, and how they can be combined to evaluate risk. d) Define the analysis approach (e.g., threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented), describing how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed to ensure adequate coverage of the problem space at a consistent level of detail. The clauses of this Annex provide guidance in the development of an assessment methodology, and how security risk is evaluated.  B.1 Risk assessment process A high-level assessment process is shown in Figure B.1.  © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  21 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 Figure B.1 - A basic high-level risk assessment process2 Four primary activities should be implemented in the manufacturer’s security risk management processes and are outlined in B.1.1 through B.1.4. B.1.1 Prepare for assessment As part of the overall security risk management plan, the manufacturer should document the following items regarding the security risk assessment step.  a) Identify the purpose of the assessment in terms of the information that the assessment is intended to produce and the decisions the assessment is intended to support. Define the specific linkages between security risk assessment and safety risk assessment as discussed in Clause 3. b) Identify the scope of the assessment, including the following: 1) The operating environment and how it is managed when the device is in use. 2) The breadth of the device lifecycle to be covered: including design, test, manufacturing, deployment, field updates, refurbishment/repair, and retirement.  c) Identify the assumptions and constraints associated with the assessment, including the following: 1) Types and granularity of threat sources and threat events that should be considered. 2) Types of vulnerabilities to be considered and the process to be used to identify potential vulnerabilities.  3) The range of operating environments to be considered for the device being assessed. 4) The level of acceptable risk tolerance and uncertainty may also be documented.  d) Identify sources for threats, vulnerabilities, and impact to be used in the risk assessment. e) Identify the risk model and analytic approaches (i.e., assessment and analysis approaches) to be employed during the assessment. 1) Identify the processes to combine assessment factors into estimates of likelihood, impact, and risk.  2) Identify the assessment approach to be used (quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative. See B.3). 3) Identify the analysis approach to be used (threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented. See B.4) 2 Adapted from Figure 5, NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) 22 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016The results of these decisions should be documented and provided to the assessment team. B.1.2 Conduct assessment The activities associated with conducting a security risk assessment are documented in B.2 through B.4. B.1.3 Communicate results The manufacturer should define the form and frequency of information to be communicated to organizational decision makers. This can be in the form of briefings, summary reports, information dashboards, or other communication vehicles that are consistent with how safety risk assessments are delivered.  Of specific importance is defining the communications mechanisms to pass information between the security risk assessment and safety risk assessment teams. Key members of each team should participate in the assessment activities of the other team.  B.1.4 Maintain assessment Security risk assessment maintenance is done throughout the product lifecycle, even during product development, as new information from outside the organization may indicate updates to risk assessments are required. Such information might be the identification of new threats that are focusing attention on Health IT and medical device networks, new threat events impacting health or related industries, or new vulnerabilities identified in software components that are incorporated into the device in development (e.g., operating system or third party code libraries).  Maintenance should also be planned during the supported life of the device, similarly focusing on learned changes to the threat landscape that could impact the risk assessment and require reassessment of potential mitigating controls or software updates.  B.1.5 Other security risk assessment processes While this guidance focuses on the NIST assessment process, there are other models that may be appropriate, depending on the device and organizational development processes. The following subclauses document a few options. B.1.5.1 Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) CVSS is an open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities, maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). The US National Vulnerability Database uses CVSS scoring to rank critical vulnerabilities. CVSS requires the assessment/scoring of several metrics for each assessed vulnerability. These metrics are combined using a formula specific to the CVSS model into scores for “Exploitability” (or likelihood) and “Impact.” B.1.5.2 Open web application security project (OWASP) OWASP is a “worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software.” The OWASP Risk Rating Methodology creates a risk assessment measure through evaluating Likelihood and Impact. Like the NIST and CVSS models, a set of discrete measures is assessed, and the model computes the Likelihood, Impact, and overall risk for a vulnerability. B.1.5.3 Attack trees Attack trees are a technique that can be used in security risk assessments to assess the risk of a security violation from one of many possible attacks or from a combination of attacks [12][20][67]. Attack trees are similar to fault trees used in Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). As in FTA a parent node may require one of many (OR) or a combination (AND) of successful attacks for a security violation represented by the parent to be considered successful. Unlike FTA, however, attack trees are not derived from random statistical events and are therefore not amenable to quantitative determination of probabilities using Bayesian statistical methods. Attack trees use a holistic approach to security, including not only components and subsystems, but larger system attributes, such as human interaction, servers, and networks. Analysis of attack trees can identify not only technical defects in a system, but also weaknesses in physical security procedures and operating procedures. Attack trees recognize that it is almost impossible to eliminate all defects in components, but that a secure architecture will limit and lessen the consequences of these failures. Attack trees combine the knowledge of subject matter experts from diverse fields, including human factors, into a single model that provides a high-level picture of security. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  23 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Attack tree models show if an adversary is capable of performing a specific attack and which attacks are most desirable to attackers. The combination of feasibility and desirability provide an indication of the likelihood of specific attacks by a given adversary. The consequence of the attack on the victim can be incorporated into the model to assess risks associated with various attacks. B.2 Risk model As stated in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]), “Risk models define the risk factors to be assessed and the relationships among those factors.” Typical risk factors that make up a model are shown in Figure B.2, including threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. Threats can be evaluated for intent (or goals) and capabilities. Vulnerabilities may either pre-exist in the design/implementation (inherent) or may be introduced by the threat as a means to exploit the device (e.g., when malicious software is introduced into a system to create a new vulnerability). Impacts may either be reversible (e.g., when known good copies of information are restored from a backup) or may be irreversible. This later case covers impacts that cross over into device safety – for example, if a device is tampered with to change therapy settings or make it non-functional when it is needed in a critical situation.    24 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Figure B.2 - Security risk is assessed using three primary factors3  As illustrated in Figure B.2, security risk is a function of the three primary factors – threats, vulnerabilities, and resulting impacts. Security controls can be implemented to reduce the effect of any of the risk factors. Some of the methods are listed at the bottom of Figure B.2.  A generic process for risk assessment is shown in Figure B.3. The process begins by an assessment of the risk factors–threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. The order in which these are assessed can vary depending on the organization, the assessment goals, the device, and its intended use. A discussion of the alternatives can be found in B.4.    Figure B.3 - Security risk assessment process4 3 Adapted from Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat - Defense Science Board (see Bibliography [19]) © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  25                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016The following subclauses address the assessment of the three main risk factors. B.2.1 Threat assessment Threat sources may be adversarial or non-adversarial. One class of non-adversarial threats comes from user error, and the processes followed to meet ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62366-1 medical device usability requirements should include risks associated with use and misuse of the security features of the device. Manufacturers should consider both the normal use of the device, as well as the steps required to securely set up the device, and to maintain it. For example, if user confusion causes poor maintenance of a secure device, security properties may be lost.  Depending on the characteristics of the device being assessed, non-adversarial threats from natural events such as weather may also be appropriate to consider. If the device function requires interaction with a high-availability remote computing function (such as a cloud service), then such natural events could impact the availability of that service, and it should be included in the security risk assessment process.  Manufacturers should document potential adversarial threats from malicious actors as one of the critical security risk factors. These threats should go well beyond those threats that may already have been experienced by the manufacturer, as the threat landscape is constantly changing, and the attacks experienced in the past are very poor indicators for what may be attempted in the future. This is a fundamentally different approach from that used by safety risk assessment methods where historical data on failure rates can be a good metric for predicting similar failures in the future.  When appropriate for the type of device, robust intrusion detection and security logging methods should be designed into a remote monitoring system to ensure that this data will have predictive value.  Understanding the range of possible threat actors and the methods they may use to attack a device requires a thorough understanding of the nature of these attacks on other systems, and vigilance on the constantly changing capabilities and tools they use.  B.2.1.1 Characteristics of adversarial threats In most cases, adversarial threat actors are rational human beings who have technical capabilities that they use to try to achieve their goals. Understanding these patterns can help the manufacturer identify what group(s) and method(s) are most likely to be used in an attack against a medical device.  Manufacturers should also recognize that there are three broad reasons why their device may be subject to an attack: a) An attacker is creating general purpose malware to harvest computing to achieve other purposes, such as creating a botnet, sending spam or mining bitcoins (to name a few reasons). Manufacturers who use common COTS operating systems and tools may be at risk to such malware, even though it is not specifically targeted to their device.  b) The attacker may wish to exploit assets via other vulnerable connected devices or through the network that the device is connected to (such as PII or insurance information), and they use the device as a “pivot” to gain access to the network or other computing equipment. The general knowledge that medical devices are slow to be patched, and often are based on old, vulnerable software versions can make them attractive targets for well-established attack vectors. c) The attacker specifically targets the medical device, either to gain access to information contained in the device, or to interfere with the device’s operation.  Manufacturers have traditionally only considered the latter category to be their responsibility, and may dismiss it as unlikely. However, the joint responsibility of the end user and manufacturer to ensure that the health delivery system is safe and secure makes all three categories relevant when understanding the potential threats.  A study commissioned by the Department of Defense, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat - Defense Science Board (see Bibliography [19]), noted that different classes of threats have significantly different technical capabilities and resources. The report categorized “threat tiers” as shown in Figure B.4 and Table B.1.  While the assessment of risk will ultimately define the degree of required security controls, it is recommended that medical device systems that include a risk of injury include an analysis and associated defenses for threat tiers I through IV. 4 Adapted from NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) 26 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016                                                                                                                                                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Threat assessments need to be maintained, as the threat landscape is changing quickly. The recent past has demonstrated an increasingly short time between an exploit being developed by one of the higher-capability threats (such as a nation-state) and its repurposing and use by one of the lower capability attackers (such as organized crime). The short time between the disclosure of the Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014 and its use to attack health care systems (on the order of 1 month) is evidence of the rapid adoption of new knowledge by attackers to achieve their goals.   Figure B.4 - Cyber Threat Taxonomy5  For each threat source, analyze and document the following characteristics:  Skill level – As captured in the threat tiers, different attacker classes have different capabilities. When combined with vulnerabilities (see B.3), a determination can be made of which attacker class may have the technical capabilities to mount a more complex exploit.   Motivation – Attackers have a wide range of motivations that can include fame, financial gain, intellectual property, curiosity, anger, or even having a political agenda.   Desire for anonymity – Some attackers require anonymity to consider their attack a success, and may only mount their attack from a remote location. Other attacker classes seek personal attention and may attack a sample device as a “demonstration” to embarrass the manufacturer and obtain fame.   5 From Figure 2.1 in Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat - Defense Science Board (see Bibliography [19]) © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  27                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Table B.1 - Description of Threat Tiers6 Tier Description I Practitioners who rely on others to develop the malicious code, delivery mechanisms, and execution strategy (use known exploits). II Practitioners with a greater depth of experience, with the ability to develop their own tools (from publicly known vulnerabilities). III Practitioners who focus on the discovery and use of unknown malicious code, are adept at installing user and kernel mode rootkits, frequently use data mining tools, target corporate executives and key users (government and industry) for the purpose of stealing personal and corporate data with the expressed purpose of selling the information to other criminal elements. IV Criminal or state actors who are organized, highly technical, proficient, well-funded professionals working in teams to discover new vulnerabilities and develop exploits.  V State actors who create vulnerabilities through an active program to “influence” commercial products and services during design, development or manufacturing, or with the ability to impact products while in the supply chain to enable exploitation of networks and systems of interest.  VI States with the ability to successfully execute full spectrum (cyber capabilities in combination with all of their military and intelligence capabilities) operations to achieve a specific outcome in political, military, economic, etc. domains and apply at scale.   B.2.1.2 Threat events Threat events are the means by which a threat actor mounts an attack. Enumerating potential threat events helps the manufacturer understand the various methods attackers might use to get into their device and focus efforts on developing lists of potential vulnerabilities that might make the attacker successful.  To develop a comprehensive list of threat events the risk analyst should examine the techniques that a malicious actor might follow. In other words, “think like a hacker”. Some of the steps attackers use to penetrate a system are listed below:  Reconnaissance - collecting intelligence about the system;  Penetration - gaining access to the system;  Enumeration - discovering other system resources; reconnaissance from within the system;  Execution - conducting a computer network attack or computer network exploitation;  Maintenance - maintaining access to the system by importing tools and installing backdoors; and  Concealment - obfuscating to prevent discovery of the exploit or the access tools. Appendix E of NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) contains a list of potential threat events organized along similar categories. Another useful source of threat event information is the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) list maintained by MITRE and the US Department of Homeland Security (see Bibliography [46]). 6 From Table 2.1 in Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat - Defense Science Board, January 2013 28 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016B.2.1.3 Example threats The following list can be used to aid in the identification of possible threats and their potential motivations. This list should not be considered comprehensive, and the manufacturer should assemble one that is tailored to the specific characteristics of their device and its deployment into use in the field. Manufacturers should use threat source data from NIST, the Health IT sector, and from related business sectors (such as Industrial Control Systems) to create a comprehensive, up-to-date list. a) Adversarial Actors 1) Nation States (Tiers IV-VI) 2) Organized Crime (Tier IV) 3) Disgruntled/ex-employees (Tier II-III) 4) Political Activists (Tier I-III) 5) Emotionally unstable (Tier I-III) 6) “Script kiddies” (Tier I) b) Non-adversarial Actors 1) Academic researchers (Tier II-III) 2) Professional security researchers (Tier II-III) 3) Unintentional Misuse i) Inexperienced users ii) Inexperienced installers iii) Inexperienced maintainers c) Other threat sources 1) Natural events 2) Integration effects, such as i) RF Interference ii) Incompatible software iii) “Misbehaving” third party systems on network iv) Vulnerable systems or devices directly connected to the device (e.g., via RS-232, USB, or other “hardwired” non-network connections) B.2.2 Vulnerability assessment While some of the more notable vulnerabilities that have been reported are weaknesses in implementation, or “bugs” (e.g., Heartbleed, Shellshock, etc.), others can be due to design decisions, or problems in how a device is used in the field. For example, the decision to use a common, fixed password for the maintenance account on all devices from a manufacturer is a design choice that creates a vulnerability that can be easily exploited if that password becomes generally known. A thorough vulnerability assessment is a critical component to a comprehensive security risk assessment, as it is impossible for an organization to make good decisions about which vulnerabilities need to be mitigated if it is unaware that they are present.  Identifying potential vulnerabilities can be done in several ways. First, there are common catalogs of known vulnerabilities in existing, fielded systems. One of the largest is the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures List maintained by MITRE under funding from the United States – Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) (see Bibliography [46]). The US-CERT also maintains a set of publications and vulnerability alert notification tools to allow manufacturers to keep in touch with changes and trends. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  29 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Manufacturers should also be aware of the various Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Organizations (ISAOs), including the National Health ISAC (NH-ISAC) that covers the healthcare sector. ISACs and ISAOs are used for information sharing regarding cybersecurity incidents and can be a source of information about vulnerabilities that are being exploited in existing systems.  Manufacturers should also utilize published information to avoid introducing common errors into their own software that might become a vulnerability. The IEEE Center for Secure design has a published Avoiding the Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws (see Bibliography [37]). MITRE also supports a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list (see Bibliography [48]) that provides a unified, measurable set of software weaknesses that is a useful reference as well. Manufacturers are also encouraged to become familiar with the tools used by the attacker community – often the same tools that are used by third party “penetration testers” to determine if a system is resilient to a wide variety of known attacks. One of the most common is the open source tool, “Metasploit.” Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) subcomponents are another source of system vulnerabilities that are often overlooked or assumed to be secure. COTS subcomponents include hardware devices, software modules developed by other organizations, and the operating system (OS). Some OSs, first designed for desktop or general purpose computing, enable many interfaces by default through network connections, wireless and other interface ports. Manufacturers should analyze the OS to identify enabled communication features that are not used directly by the device software, as these provide ingress for threat vectors. Additional sources of system vulnerabilities are those discovered during post-launch monitoring. Vulnerabilities discovered post-launch present a high risk, because fielded devices may not be updated until the patient returns for a checkup or the device receives periodic maintenance or service update. Predisposing conditions can include aspects of the operating environment. For example, a device that is only used within an operating room might depend on the physical security of the hospital to ensure that only authorized users physically interact with it. Predisposing conditions may be assessed for their pervasiveness in order to determine to what extent a vulnerability may be mitigated by them. If that same device is also used in outpatient clinics or locations where physical security cannot be assured, the vulnerabilities exposed by the physical user interface may be of greater concern in the overall risk assessment.  B.2.2.1 Example vulnerability classes The following list can be used as a starting point to aid in the identification of vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat. It should not be considered a complete set, but should be expanded as appropriate.  a) Physical environment of the system 1) Information displayed on a screen 2) Physical security 3) Power availability b) Personnel 1) Users 2) Developers 3) Support staff c) Management d) Administrative procedures and security measures within the organization e) Business operation and service delivery f) Hardware 1) Debug interfaces enabled 2) Use of removable media 3) Lack of physical tamper detection and response g) Software 30 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20161) Memory safety violations 2) Input validation error 3) Race conditions 4) Privilege-confusion 5) User interface failures h) Communication equipment and facilities 1) Side channels B.2.3 Impact assessment The third risk factor that needs to be assessed is the possible impacts that a threat source could cause if an attack is successful. This will be broader than the set of harms that are considered in the safety risk assessment, as it should include factors such as information loss, loss of trust/reputation, as well as loss of device effectiveness.  The following list is an adaptation of the impact examples in Appendix H of NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]). It can be a starting point for medical device manufacturers in developing an organization-specific impact list that can help with the identification of applicable harm(s): a) Impact to Operations 1) Loss of device effectiveness 2) Loss of device therapy 3) Loss of availability b) Impact to Assets 1) Physical 2) Information 3) Communications c) Impact to Individuals 1) Physical injury or loss of life 2) Inappropriate or suboptimal therapy 3) Loss of PII 4) Patient concern d) Impact to other organizations or the environment 1) Damage to property 2) Damage to the environment 3) Device becomes vector to attack other systems It is also appropriate for a manufacturer to consider the business impact of cybersecurity breaches, which are completely separate from any harmful degradation of the device’s intended use or effectiveness. A data breach, for example, might lead to penalties for disclosure of PII, and the financial impact of such a data breach should be a factor in security mitigation decisions, whether that impact is to the manufacturer or to their customer (which would result in a loss of trust and reputation for the manufacturer). B.2.3.1 Asset inventory One of the useful tools in creating a comprehensive list of potential impacts is to first document a complete set of device assets. Once complete, for each asset, consider the impact if the asset had a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The importance of these factors will vary depending upon the specific device involved. For example, a device that does not store or communicate patient identifiable information may meet its intended use with little © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  31 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016concern for confidentiality, so vulnerabilities that degrade confidentiality may be of less concern than those that degrade integrity. Similarly, a device that provides therapy may have a very high requirement for integrity and availability.  Another factor to consider in completing the asset inventory is to identify any asset that would be an attractive target for an attacker. Based on the attacker motivations discussed in B.2.1, there may be specific device assets that would help an attacker achieve their motivations. For devices that may be connected to a broader network (e.g. HDO intranet) the attractive target may be the information in systems on that network, and the threat actor may want to use vulnerabilities in the device to conduct such an attack, with undetermined impacts on the device’s operation. The following list can be used as a starting point to aid in the identification of the assets that may be the target of value for a threat. It should not be considered a complete list, but should be expanded as appropriate. B.2.3.2 Asset identification Physical Assets a) User interface b) Device assets 1) Operating system 2) Software libraries 3) Application software 4) Keys/Certificates 5) Device identity 6) Device resources i) Processing ii) Memory iii) I/O 7) Physical interfaces c) Device telemetry d) Network interface  Information Assets a) Patient data b) HDO data c) Insurance/coverage data d) Device settings/programming commands e) Passwords f) Configurations 1) Network 2) Infrastructure g) Diagnostic logs h) Physical location i) Telemetry data j) Session credentials (keys, tokens, etc.) 32 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 B.3 Assessment approaches The safety risk assessment approaches presented in Annex D of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971 include quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative examples. Many assessment models for traditional safety risk management encourage the use of quantitative measures, and statistics collected from past device performance can be a rich source of data to calibrate such models. However, security risks that result from a vulnerability being intentionally exploited by some threat actor involves human behavior. As a result, most security risk assessment models use qualitative or semi-quantitative measures to assess risk. Qualitative approaches typically use a small set of non-numeric values (e.g., Low, Medium, High) and can be quite subjective unless clear definitions are provided for how these values should be chosen. Semi-quantitative approaches that use a set of bins with numeric ranges may allow the risk assessment team to use subject matter experts (or small set of them) to agree on the assignment of values, allowing more reasoning about the values, while still allowing mapping to a set of qualitative values when the final recommendations are reported out to management.  Regardless of which approach is selected, the manufacturer should clearly document the decision criteria and how the resulting assessment values for the different risk factors are agreed upon.  B.4 Security analysis approaches As was shown in Figure B.3, the three risk factors (threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts) are interrelated in that knowledge of one of the factors may assist in determining what to analyze for the other factors. There are three different approaches that can be used, depending on which risk factor is assessed first:  Threat-oriented – First identify the threat sources and events, through the development of threat scenarios. Identify the vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploitable by those threats and impacts based on the threat actor’s motivations. (See Figure B.5).  Asset/impact-oriented – Perform a complete asset inventory and assess the potential impact if those assets are compromised. Identify vulnerabilities that could lead to those impacts and threat sources/events that might initiate exploits utilizing those vulnerabilities. (See Figure B.6)  Vulnerability-oriented – Begin by analyzing potential vulnerabilities and pre-disposing conditions that may be exploitable. Identify threat events and sources that could initiate those exploits, and then capture the potential impact if the exploits were successful. (See Figure B.7) © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  33 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 Figure B.5 - An example Threat-oriented Security Risk assessment approach7   Figure B.6 - An example Asset-oriented Security Risk assessment approach  7 Adapted from NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) 34 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016                                                            AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 Figure B.7 - An example Vulnerability-oriented Security Risk assessment approach  The choice of which approach to follow is up to the manufacturer and should be documented in the security risk management plan. Choices should be driven by knowledge of the organization and goals of the risk analysis. If the target of the analysis is a complete system or if there are specific threats that need to be addressed, a threat-oriented approach may be appropriate. If it is a single device that will be used in the context of a larger system by an end-customer, an asset/impact-oriented approach may be the best. It is also useful to consider multiple approaches, as the biases built in to one approach may cause some risks to be missed. A second approach may also be used by an independent “red-team” that can be used to look for critical risks that may have been missed. During post-market deployment, new risks may be learned through the exposure of new vulnerabilities. A vulnerability-oriented analysis approach is likely the most appropriate to respond quickly when needing to determine if a risk mitigation is required when the vulnerability is discovered.  B.5 Assessing security risk Security risk is assessed by combining the likelihood that a threat will successfully exploit a vulnerability and result in an impact with the severity of that impact.  Safety risk is defined as the “combination of the probability of occurrence of harm [to the patient, other user or environment] and the severity of that harm.” Traditional safety risk management approaches were designed to deal with random failures in which the likelihood of occurrence is largely based on design and manufacturing factors. In such cases, probability is often a statistical estimate, or the multiplication of a set of independent probabilities to predict future occurrence. In contrast, in security risk assessment likelihood is an estimate of whether an attacker will invest the time and resources to exploit that vulnerability to achieve something the attacker sees as valuable. While human motivations are not amenable to traditional statistical analysis, a likelihood is typically assessed by combining the assessments of a threat and a specific vulnerability. The manufacturer’s overall risk model should define the specific factors and how © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  35 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016they are combined to produce a qualitative or semi-quantitative likelihood value. Caution should be applied, as factors may not be independent.  The resulting likelihood value for an exploited vulnerability can be combined with the impact of the exploit to determine an overall security risk level. Organizations should define the levels of acceptable, conditionally- acceptable and unacceptable risk. Security risk controls should be implemented to reduce the risk to an acceptable zone. These controls should also be assessed to determine if they result in a new safety or security risk.  36 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Annex C (informative) Generating cybersecurity requirements The backbone to security risk management is the ability to express the medical device security behaviors, including mitigations and risk controls, in the form of verifiable requirements.  Cybersecurity requirements are implemented to reduce the security risks by decreasing the likelihood that the device’s confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability are intentionally or unintentionally compromised. The cybersecurity requirements generation process starts by the identification of security controls through the security risk assessment techniques described in Annex B. The identified security controls are then used to draft verifiable security requirements that reside within the design history file for the medical device. The generation of security requirements should follow system engineering best practices. Each individual requirement should be:  Attainable: Technically and legally possible;  Unambiguous: Simple, concise, standalone expression of a whole idea or statement;  Clear: Not confusing, using simple words, concise statements, and consistent language;  Consistent: Not in conflict with other requirements;  Verifiable: Can be determined that the system meets the requirement either via verification or validation;  Necessary: Essential to meet the need of a stakeholder by implementing a security control;  Design free: Does not specify a design approach; and  Positive: Written in the affirmative, not the negative. To generate good security requirements, the following questions should be asked:  Is this security requirement technically and legally possible?  Can the intended audience describe the security constraint on the device from this requirement?  Can the intended audience identify the subject of the requirement (e.g., component, system, interface)?  Can the intended audience identify the security action to be taken by the subject (e.g., shall process, shall display)?  Can the intended audience identify the thing acted upon to reduce the likelihood of a threat to exploit a system vulnerability from this requirement?  Can the intended audience identify the conditions under which the security action must take place (e.g., auto-logout after 10 minutes of idle activity)?  Can this security requirement be verified by analysis, demonstration, inspection, or testing?  What is the source of this security requirement (e.g., stakeholder, security risk assessment, regulation)?  Does the security requirement identify the solution?  Is the security requirement written as a positive statement such that it can be verified by analysis, demonstration, inspection, or test? If the answer to any question is “no,” the security controls identified in the risk assessment should be revisited to determine the intent and expected behavior. This cycle is continued until a concise statement is written to capture why the security control is required and what the system will do. Below are three primary challenges to writing good security requirements: © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  37 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016a) Avoiding negative requirements: One of the most common challenges encountered is preventing negative requirements (e.g., “The system shall not allow unauthorized users.”). Unfortunately, negative requirements make verification unattainable, because they require proving that the system will never allow a particular event, under any conditions. Thus, it is important to (a) correct the requirement language and (b) limit the scope of the system’s requirement documents to what the system does do, not what the system does not do. If the intent of a negative requirement is to describe “what the system must do,” try to substitute active verbs for the word “not.” For example, the above could be rephrased as: “The system shall reject unauthorized users.” b) Human factors vs. security balance: The requirements must also provide an appropriate balance between the sometimes competing needs of security and human factors. It is common for a requirement that increases usability to also reduce overall system security and for the converse to occur. The security risk assessment for the medical system should drive the relative importance of each potential security requirement and guide the final balance reached.  c) Properly planned verification/validation: All requirements need to be written to allow them to be tested to ensure proper system operation. The following methods of confirmation should be considered during requirement generation:  1) Verification by:  i) Analysis: involves a technical evaluation of design information, such as equations, charts, graphs, drawings, schematics, and other data. ii) Demonstration: involves operation, manipulation, or adjustment of an item during performance of a function. iii) Inspection: involves physical examination of the item using the naked eye, tools, gauges, or other measuring devices. iv) Test: involves observation or recording of data during operation of an instrumented calibrated item. 2) Validation of requirements through one of the following forms:  i) Actual Use Testing: finished devices or components are placed in the actual operating environment (laboratory, hospital, clinic) and operated by trained users on actual patients, samples, etc. ii) Simulated Use Testing: finished devices or components are placed in a simulated use setting and operated by trained users on pre-screened individuals or derived samples representing a cross-section of the anticipated population. In summary, cybersecurity requirements are clear, testable, and reference further detailed background to justify their need, such as a policy or compliance standard. Furthermore, per NIST Special Publication 800-53, security requirements include those requirements levied on a system that are derived from laws, executive orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted. The following are examples of properly written security requirements for a use case that requires a medical device to send data via Bluetooth (as required by market specification) to a mobile device. REQ 1: The system shall select radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to a maximum of 15 dBm.  Intent: Reduce the probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries. Reference: NIST SP800-53r4 AC-18(4), NIST SP800-121r1 REQ 2: The system shall utilize <XYZ> level encryption during data transmission. Intent: Provide confidentiality to patient data during transit over the Bluetooth link.

Clause 4.2 of this TIR asks the manufacturer to indicate the intended use and identification of characteristics related to the security of the medical device. Taking these two directives as input, this annex strives to pose a series of questions designed to aid the manufacturer in defining the characteristics of the device that affect or are affected by security, the risks arising from these characteristics, and the design controls that may be put in place to mitigate those risks.  ANSI/AAMI/IEC 80001-2-2 introduces the concept of security capabilities for IT-networks incorporating medical devices, and it is this approach that provides the foundation for this annex which uses these capability classes to identify security vulnerabilities as outlined in 4.3 of this TIR. If these questions are considered from the point of view of all the stakeholders involved (e.g., users, maintainers, patients, etc.), a more complete picture can emerge of where the security risks can be found. Once these have been identified, their impact on the safety of the device (hazards) must be assessed. The list is not exhaustive, or representative of all medical devices, and the manufacturer is advised to add questions that can have applicability to the particular medical device and to skip questions that are not relevant to the particular medical device. The manufacturer is also advised to consider each question not only on its own but also in relation to others. D.1 Essential performance Essential performance, as defined in ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1 is described as the “performance of a clinical function, other than related to basic safety, where loss or degradation beyond the limits specified by the manufacturer results in an unacceptable risk”.  Evaluating essential performance is one technique that may be used to identify security risks with a safety impact. Extra security measures may be appropriate based on the specific capabilities, properties, asset, or attributes of the device, and the security controls designed into the device should keep these capabilities or assets (essential performance) secure.  a) What is the essential performance of the device?  1) Is it a life-sustaining medical device?  i) How is the device used to sustain life? Can the life-sustaining functions (essential performance) performed by the device be guaranteed in the event of a security breach or denial of service attack? 2) Can unauthorized access, unauthorized activities, or loss of data affect essential performance? b) Can the device be used to affect the patient? For example, warming, electrical impulses, x-rays, deliver fluids? c) Is the medical device intended to modify the patient environment? Factors that should be considered include temperature, humidity, atmospheric gas composition, pressure, light. 1) Is access to these functions controlled with the appropriate authorization controls? d) Is the device implanted in a patient? 1) How are instructions or measurements taken from the device while it is implanted in the patient?

This Annex consists of the following components:  A fictional system, the Kidneato artificial implantable kidney, provides a platform for the discussion of security issues and techniques. Keep in mind that this specific example can also represent a wide range of medical devices and accessories. For example, the “Kidneato Programmer” fits into a controlled network where one might find a CT scanner, infusion pump, or other medical device.  A cyber hygiene example that provides a partial list of good security practices designers and users of a system should follow.  A security analysis using risk methodology.  Risk analysis of an implanted medical device communication design decision.  An example implementation of a medical device communication accessory. The example implementation follows a format where:  An initial design is implemented using good engineering practices without regard to the recommendations of this document;  an example of how the implementation is viewed from the attacker’s perspective;  potential impact from the attack;  an analysis of factors that enabled the attack and how recommendations of this document would have prevented the possibility of this attack;  security risk controls that could be applied to the initial design to reduce the cybersecurity risks. The example implementation asks readers open-ended questions. This helps the reader better understand the attacker’s thinking and methods while encouraging them to apply the questions to their own work. Unfortunately, there is no single correct solution for any situation or implementation. These questions should help extend the example to cover a broader perspective. E.1 The Kidneato System The purpose of this example product is to illustrate a specific example, the Kidneato, but to also represent a wide array of products. The location, communication, processing, data storage are of primary importance, rather than the specific medical function. Besides representing the Kidneato programmer for the following examples, the Network-connected Medical Instrument could also be viewed as network-connected capital equipment (i.e., CT scanner, radiation treatment, infusion pumps, anesthesia, heart bypass pump, digital X-ray, and other medical devices).  Non-capital equipment may be part of a manufactured accessory kit or it may be patient-supplied such as a personal smart phone, or wireless scale. The Kidneato system consists of an implanted medical device along with accessories that support the implant and subsequent operation of the medical device. Block diagrams of the Kidneato system are provided in Figures E.1 and E.2.   © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  49 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Figure E.1- Block diagram of the Kidneato system, managed environment       50 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016  Figure E.2 – Block diagram of the Kidneato system, patient environment  The Kidneato is a therapy and diagnostic implant. It is configured and tested at implant and again prior to patient discharge. It is subsequently managed by the patient, caregiver, HDO, or family member through a combination of remote (non-clinical setting) and clinic follow-ups.  Each Kidneato has an identifier established during manufacturing and cannot be changed. This identifier is associated with a patient master account and HDO master account to administer and monitor the medical device through web services.  Web services are not required to manage the device. Without web services, the device history is limited to printed reports generated when an HDO interacts with the patient.  The Kidneato has a wireless interface that allows it to communicate with system components provided by the manufacturer. The following information is sent and received: a) Transmit diagnostic information 1) Patient information 2) Disease 3) Device status © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  51 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016b) Receive commands and information 1) Request information 2) Set patient information 3) Set alert parameters 4) Set therapy parameters 5) Set calibration parameters (factory only) 6) Update bootloader (factory only) 7) Update firmware (factory or field) c) During its operation, the Kidneato: 1) Provides therapy; 2) Monitors and records device and patient information; 3) Generates alerts; 4) Transmits and receives data; and 5) Battery is recharged through an inductive charger. E.2 Kidneato programmer The programmer is provided by the device manufacturer as a leased or purchased accessory. Its only function is as a Kidneato accessory. It is used by trained personnel during device implant and subsequent in-clinic follow-up/device check. Service or updates (including software) are provided by the manufacturer.  In the Kidneato examples, this subsystem is used to interact with the Kidneato implant. From a security perspective, it also represents any medical device or accessory in the clinic or hospital that is connected to a network.  The programmer has the following features: a) Remote (in-room) display of main screen b) Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and optional cellular communications 1) Communicates with Web Services (local or cloud) 2) Communicates with local printers 3) Controlled from a remote location 4) Storage of reports/data (WebDAV, SFTP, etc.) 5) Software and firmware updates 6) Remote services for maintenance by the manufacturer via back-end infrastructure c) USB (mass storage) 1) Storage of reports/data 2) Firmware update of the medical device 3) Software update of the Programmer d) USB (serial port emulation) 1) Service/debug port for use by the manufacturer e) USB (HID) 1) Human input device, such as keyboard or mouse 52 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016E.3 In-home monitor (IHM) The IHM is used by the patient or caregiver when the patient is away from the clinic or hospital. Primary users are the patient or nurse with only minimal training.  In the Kidneato examples, this subsystem is used to interact with the Kidneato implant. From a security perspective, it also represents any medical device or accessory that may or may not be patient owned and is located outside of the clinic or hospital environment and is connected to a public network.  The IHM utilizes a user-purchased OTS computing device, such as a tablet or a PC (referred to as “Tablet”). An application software accessory is downloaded from an appropriate source and installed on the computing device by the user or owner. The software accessory is capable of communications with the implanted device via wireless signaling to an inductive communication Wireless Communication Accessory (WCA) that is also used for recharging the implanted medical device. Communications between the Tablet and WCA are conducted using conventional means, such as a Bluetooth connection. a) Medical Device Communications 1) Mutual induction to implanted device 2) Bi-directional communications 3) High-power downlink mode to recharge battery b) Tablet/ WCA Communications 1) Wireless Bluetooth communications between Tablet and WCA 2) Bluetooth pairing with tablet and WCA 3) Ability to update WCA firmware from Tablet c) WCA Operation 1) Battery operated 2) Rechargeable via conventional USB charging port 3) LEDs and beeper indicate status 4) Button to turn on/off 5) No alphanumeric display E.4 Web services Web services provide a central repository for data related to the medical device. This is a specialized medical device requiring web services beyond the scope of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.  In the Kidneato examples, this subsystem is shown to have specific capabilities. From a security perspective, it also represents any type of service that has public incoming and outgoing connections in a hosting solution, including “cloud hosting.” The subsystem may or may not include PII and Class III software.  Web services are implemented using a cloud-based architecture that is scalable and redundant. The services are built upon existing technology for the foundation and only minimal code is created to hook the foundational technologies together and to provide specific services related to the medical device and its users. a) Communication 1) Programmer i) Downloads medical device firmware updates ii) Downloads programmer firmware updates iii) Downloads firmware for new products iv) Uploads implant information © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  53 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016v) Uploads follow-up information vi) Downloads historical data, analysis, recommendations vii) Communicates with Web Services via Internet connections 2) In-Home Monitor 3) EHR Access i) Web Services provides an API for integration with EHRs 4) Administrator Access 5) HDO Access 6) Patient Access 7) Caregiver Access 8) Family Access - iPhone, etc. b) Data 1) Patient identification 2) Patient history 3) Device information 4) Device history 5) Therapy history 6) Transaction history 7) Reports 8) Event history 9) Anonymized research data E.5 Web services - Direct access Web services are made available to individuals through a software accessory that is installed on a computing platform of the user’s choosing (PC, tablet, etc.). The accessory software communicates with Web Services via a screen and input device. Requests or instructions from the individual are communicated via the Web Services interface. Received data is rendered on the screen and or provided for printing or local storage (pdf).  Accessory software is downloaded by the user through the appropriate Internet service (Apple App Store, Apple Mac Store, Google Store, or PC download site).  The user authenticates via a user name and password. The user name and password are also used to determine the user’s level of authority: a) Administrator 1) Administers the hospital, clinic, caregiver, and additional administrator accounts. 2) Can view/enter administrative data. b) Medical Provider (Health Delivery Organization) 1) Uses provided account to access medical data, change therapy, and read/write notes. c) Caregiver 1) Uses provided account to access medical data and write notes, read responses. d) Patient 54 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/20161) Uses manufacturer-provided account to view a high-level summary and communications with their provider. 2) Provides family access. e) Family 1) View high-level summary data. E.6 Web services - Instrument access The programmer and home monitor communicate directly with a web services API intended for machine access.  Each instrument carries a unique identifier determined during manufacturing.  API features include:  Authenticated connection;  Send queued messages to the instrument;  Receive messages and data from the instrument that are queued for subsequent processing;  Mediates remote control of the Programmer between a PC and the Programmer; and  Asset management. E.7 Example implementations We will now implement various security aspects of the Kidneato implantable medical device and its accessories. Each example will use good engineering practices. We will then examine how good engineering practices without application of the principles described in this document can lead to an insecure system. The implementation will then be modified using good security practices to show how the security of the system has been improved. E.7.1 Example #1 Basic Cyber Hygiene The security risks in this example are associated with supporting the basic cyber hygiene needs of customers to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Some basic cyber hygiene items are listed, and then the Kidneato system is used to highlight how without basic cyber hygiene, a system is insecure.  The following list represents common cyber hygiene items that have been called out throughout this document. Many of the references listed at the end of this document refer to these items [15][36][50]. The following are common cyber hygiene needs:  changing default passwords;  enforcing password complexity policies;  using authenticated and encrypted communications;  disabling unused services, including interfaces intended for debugging;  assigning user privileges appropriate to the user’s authority;  authenticating software updates;  inventorying authorized and unauthorized devices;  inventorying authorized and unauthorized software;  ensuring that software was developed using best practices for the language and execution environment;  developing and managing secure configurations for all devices;  conducting continuous (automated) vulnerability assessment and remediation;  actively managing and controlling the use of administrative privileges;  regularly updating all software, operating systems, and apps; and  regularly revisiting the top security priorities. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  55 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016E.7.1.1 Security analysis Risk methodology The security risks are associated with supporting the basic needs of customers to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. The risk methodology uses a five-point rating system – Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, and Very High, for both Likelihood and Impact. The definitions for these ratings were drawn from Table I-2 in NIST SP800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]) and have been captured in the Kidneato development process and documented in the Security Risk Management Plan.  The following represents common cyber hygiene needs based upon the information in this TIR. The risks are all unacceptable without additional actions taken. The risk control measures are necessary to reduce the cyber hygiene risks to an acceptable level. E.7.1.2 Security risk evaluation This subclause presents a simplified security risk evaluation based on Table I-5 in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]). Table E.1 - Security risk evaluation table Vulnerability Likelihood of Occurrence Impact Security Risk Risk Control Measure Kidneato Web Services does not enforce complex passwords. Users can choose a 6-character password, such as “123456”. Very High  This is a common attack with accessible attack surfaces. High Unauthorized users can gain access by performing password guessing attacks. Very High Enforce unique, complex passwords The Administrator password is the same for all deployments of the Kidneato Web Services component. Default password becomes publicly available through documentation provided by manufacturer. Very High  This is a common attack with accessible attack surfaces. High Unauthorized users can gain access by scanning the internet for exposed systems and using default credentials. Very High Ensure default credentials are changed All In-Home Monitors use the same credentials to access Kidneato services.   Moderate  Requires a multi-step approach to compromise. Moderate One Home Monitor can access data destined for a different home monitor by changing the serial number sent to the Kidneato services.  This could result in unauthorized disclosure of patient data. Moderate  Assign access privileges appropriate to the user role; one monitor must not be able to access another monitors data. 56 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Vulnerability Likelihood of Occurrence Impact Security Risk Risk Control Measure In-Home Monitors store Kidneato credentials in plaintext Moderate Requires reverse engineering a software image, as well as gaining access to a software image. Moderate By analyzing a software update image acquired over the internet, an attacker gains access to the credentials needed to impersonate all In-Home Monitors. Moderate  Store authentication credentials in encrypted format. The Kidneato Programmer is not hardened because it will reside in a hospital-controlled network. Things like network scans are not anticipated, a remotely accessible service interface is left enabled, and all applications run with administrator privileges. High Networks in hospitals are frequently compromised. Moderate The hospital network operating environment is not controlled.  The Programmer is exposed to network scans from both legitimate users performing normal network discovery operations, and illegitimate users searching for additional attack targets. The service interface is discovered and available for further attack. A successful attack can modify the machine because it has administrator privileges. Moderate  System hardening, leveraging resources such as National Checklist Program Repository, to turn off service interfaces and run in least privilege mode. The Kidneato Programmer does not keep logs of access through the service interface. High  Networks in hospitals are frequently compromised. Low A Health Delivery Organization needs to understand the extent of a compromise to facilitate mandatory reporting requirements.  Patient safety is not directly impacted by lack of logs. Low Add logging for all security related events, such as remote access, network configuration changes, and user additions. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  57 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Vulnerability Likelihood of Occurrence Impact Security Risk Risk Control Measure The Kidneato Programmer service interface is not disabled, even though configuration changes are available to turn it off. High  Users are unaware of all the interfaces. Moderate The HDO administrators are unaware that the service interface exists on the Programmer, and as a result do not disable the interface. Moderate Disable service interface in released version. OR Provide information for secure use, noting the availability of the service interface and how to disable it. The Kidneato Web Services do not receive regular security patches, even though the system is built on a commercial off-the-shelf operating system that has vulnerabilities published on a monthly basis. High  Systems are easily compromised with published exploits that have made it into common attack toolsets.  High HDO administrators are unable to patch the system, because they cannot fully verify the new functionality. Kidneato does not provide secure patches at the same rate as the commercial operating system, leaving a window of opportunity for attackers to exploit.  Moderate Provide regular updates for security vulnerabilities Software updates deliver malware through USB media. Moderate USB media is used to deliver software updates and may become compromised as part of use with other workstations.  Very High The malware causes the system to behave unpredictably. High Authenticate software updates using a digital signature. 58 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Vulnerability Likelihood of Occurrence Impact Security Risk Risk Control Measure Kidneato programmer service interface uses Telnet for debugging purposes High  Networks in hospitals are frequently compromised. Moderate Accessing the programmer remotely for service transmits both user credentials and patient data in plaintext.  An attacker with network access is able to capture and analyze the data, resulting in disclosure of sensitive data. Moderate Use SSH for remote access, and enforce unique, complex passwords for all access.  E.7.2 Example #2 Implant Communications E.7.2.1 Security analysis When the Implant connects with the WCA, the Implant and the WCA wireless systems are designed to provide integrity with CRCs. The WCA and Implant use a static unique identifier with each transmission to provide authentication. The wireless communications are not cryptographically encrypted or authenticated.  The wireless communications may be initiated from a distance of up to 30 meters. E.7.2.2 Security risk An attacker within range can establish wireless communications with the implant. The attacker may do so in order to extract patient data from the implant, or modify the therapy delivery logic in the implant. The attacker must be within range and be able to impersonate a legitimate device by knowing the unique identifier and the data packets, which are both available for recording through eavesdropping on a legitimate session. The attacker may then replay the data as is. The attacker may also modify the data by changing the unique identifier and the corresponding CRC. E.7.2.3 Likelihood The likelihood is classified as Medium for the following reasons:  The attacker may initiate this from a distance  The attacker may accomplish an attack by replaying captured or modified traffic. Either of these attacks is accessible to an attacker who is moderately familiar with wireless techniques.  The attacker can acquire the necessary equipment at relatively low cost. E.7.2.4 Impact The impact has two different classifications, depending upon the goal of the attacker.   Patient data disclosure is classified as Medium because it leaks sensitive information, but the information does not cause any harm.  Patient therapy modification is classified as High because it could result in inappropriate therapy being delivered to the patient. E.7.2.5 Risk estimation Describe the results that the attacker was able to achieve. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  59 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Table E.2 - Risk estimation analysis example Risk ID Asset Threat Vulnerability or Flaw Likelihood Impact 1 Patient Data Attacker reads patient data Lack of encryption on transmitted data Medium Medium Disclosure of patient data. 2 Patient Therapy Attacker manipulates patient therapy by replaying legitimate commands Lack of authentication on transmitted data Medium High Inappropriate therapy may be delivered.  E.7.2.6 Implemented control Risk 2, modification to patient therapy can be addressed by requiring authentication. A possible solution is to add authentication through application of cryptography. Introducing correct use of cryptographic authentication provides assurances that the data is coming from a legitimate WCA, and it also provides message freshness to provide assurances that the data is not simply replayed.   Risk 1, the disclosure of patient data can also be addressed through the application of cryptography to provide confidentiality. E.7.2.7 Residual risk estimation Introduction of the cryptographic authentication and encryption reduces the likelihood of each risk, because an attacker must acquire the key to appropriately encrypt or decrypt the data. The keys are available only to legitimate devices, and as a result the attacker cannot simply sniff wireless traffic and modify or replay it. The attacker either needs to brute force the key, which will likely take longer than the therapy communication, or they need to acquire the key through reverse engineering either the Implant or the WCA.  Table E.3 - Residual risk estimation analysis example Risk ID Threat Action Post Mitigation Likelihood  Post Mitigation Impact Rationale 1 Attacker reads patient data Cryptographic Encryption Low  Medium Reading the data requires the attacker to have the key, which is only available to legitimate devices. 2 Attacker manipulates patient therapy by replaying legitimate commands Cryptographic Authentication Low High Replaying or modifying the wireless data requires the attacker to have the key, which is only available to legitimate devices.   E.7.2.8 New risk identification The application of the cryptography has now introduced a new risk, whereby a legitimate user of the system is unable to communicate with the device to deliver therapy because they do not have the key. This new risk may have safety 60 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016consequences, and must feed into the safety risk management process. The factors responsible for the legitimate user to not have the key need to be understood, such as data corruption or broken equipment. E.7.3 Example #3 WCA Firmware Update The purpose of this example is to demonstrate two possible outcomes from a feature design: when good engineering practices are used; and when good engineering practices are combined with the guidance from this document. In the first case, a safe and reliable feature is produced in the absence of a malicious user. The malicious user, however, is not interested in how well the product performs according to its intent; he is interested in discovering emergent or other unspecified behaviors that can be used to attack the product.  E.7.3.1 Initial Design The Home Monitor WCA has firmware that must be periodically updated. The update is stored on a cloud server that communicates with the Tablet. The initial design works as follows.  a) The Tablet Application uses Bluetooth to determine if the WCA is available. If it is, it requests secure communication using a stored and previously established key. This key was created when the WCA was initially paired with Tablet by transmitting it over a wired USB connection. Once communication is established, the Tablet determines the identity of the WCA and its firmware version.  The wired connection is a “side channel” used to communicate with the key. If the key is known to the attacker, then he can communicate with the WCA. Design Considerations: What characteristics should the key have? Should it be randomly generated? If so, how should that be done? What happens to the severity of the risk if all WCAs use the same, randomly generated key? b) When the Tablet Application is started, it connects with the server and authenticates using the UserID and Password previously entered by the patient. (The app saves the password to minimize use friction with the patient.) Once the tablet is authenticated with the server, a secure connection is made using the current best practice (e.g., TLS). This is a common problem. Both the objective (signing on) and the key to that objective are stored on the same tablet, which means the attacker has everything they need if they have access to the tablet. Consequently, security is entirely dependent on the security of the tablet’s hardware and software, and lack of physical access. Design Considerations: How should the password be saved? Does encrypting it help? What should the minimum protections be? (It may help to draw a simplified diagram showing the Tablet and all the possible access points.) c) The Tablet transmits its identity (including software version) along with the WCA’s ID to the server. If an update is required, the server sends the update to the Tablet. The Tablet then sends the update to the WCA over the secure channel. The WCA validates the update, reprograms flash memory, and restarts.  Communications between the server and the tablet are encrypted and cannot be intercepted by an attacker unless they have the key. Design Considerations: Is transmission encryption sufficient protection? Does this authenticate the software update? How would you use the best practices in Annex A to improve the security of the update process? Does this process violate any of the basic security design principles? What components external to our system do we need to trust? Is there some way we could design this so we don’t have to trust components outside of our control? (Try answering the questions in Annex D.) E.7.3.2 Attack of the Design For this subclause we switch our perspective to that of the attacker. The objective of the attacker is to access the implanted medical device, retrieve confidential information, and/or change the settings on the medical device. At greater risk, the attacker can get close enough to monitor Bluetooth communications (range is about 30 meters), but there is less risk to attack from a greater distance.  a) The attacker recognizes that the Tablet is performing one-way authentication with the server. The Tablet has no idea if the server is correct or if it is malicious. The attacker monitors the network that the Tablet is connected to (Wi-Fi or LAN) and intercepts DNS queries from the Tablet for the IP address of the server. The attacker responds with the IP address of their own server to which the Tablet sends its UserID and © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  61 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Password. The attacker now has the Tablet’s login credentials and is able to communicate with the Tablet as if it were the authorized server. Design Considerations: Did you consider a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack? If not, what was missing from your analysis that caused this to be missed? Hint: The security architecture needs to have a view that shows all of the possible system access points. b) The malicious server receives the firmware and software versions. Because the WCA can be purchased on the used market, the attacker has been able to reverse engineer the hardware and rewrite the firmware. This “updated” firmware is then sent to the Tablet, which is subsequently sent to the WCA and the WCA updates itself. This accomplishes two things: 1) the attacker now has control of the WCA and; 2) the WCA may not be updatable by the manufacturer because the attacker has used a higher version number.  Design Considerations: What security practice would have prevented this? c) Similarly, the attacker downloads the medical device accessory application used in the Tablet from the Tablet’s app store. This allows the attacker to reverse engineer the app and make minor modifications. This “updated” app is then used by the Tablet. The attacker can now control the Tablet from any location on the Internet through a back-door she has installed. Design Considerations: What can an attacker learn from a published application? Consider the various types of assets discussed in the TIR. How could a published application benefit a new start-up or competitor? What is it about a published application that makes it vulnerable? What can be done to the published application to reduce the security risk? How would you proceed with a risk assessment to determine if mitigations were required for the application? d) Alternatively, the Tablet may not allow app updates except from the App Store. The attacker places their modified version of the app in the App Store and causes it to look like the manufacturer’s official app. Some percentage of the patients will download the wrong app, thus giving the attacker control of random medical devices that may be a great distance from the attacker. Design Considerations: What role does social engineering play in the system? Does your system view include the appropriate actors? How could social engineering attacks be effective against these actors? Should social engineering be considered in the security risk management analysis? How would you estimate the viability of a social engineering attack?  E.7.3.3 Results from the Attack In this subclause, some of the possible consequences of vulnerability exploitation are considered. In steps 1-3, the attacker has been able to achieve complete control of the accessories of a specific patient, but was required to be relatively close to the patient. Having complete control, the attacker can perform a remote attack at a later time or can program the WCA to perform the attack at a later time or upon a certain event trigger.  Step 4 allows the attacker to gain control of random medical device accessories. While they do not have control over which patients are affected, they may be able to hold the manufacturer hostage or create a decline in the manufacturer’s valuation.  The attacker can use Step 4 to attack a specific patient by using social engineering. The attacker contacts the patient claiming to be a representative of the manufacturer or provider. They tell the patient that their app needs to be updated and to delete the current app and install their malicious app. E.7.3.4 Analysis This broad and effective attack was made possible because the designers focused on meeting traditional product requirements that are based on a definition of normal or expected use that did not include security risk. They did not consider that a different actor, a malicious user, could use the product features against the best interest of the patient. Part of the problem was that the product was developed by different design teams assigned to different components of the product. Assumptions were made, but not confirmed, regarding how access, authentication, and integrity were being handled in other components.  A security architecture would have allowed the designers to identify assets requiring protection. Threat modeling (See Annex B) could have been used to see how those assets could be reached. Assumptions were likely made by the different design teams that other components had security covered. For example: 62 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 The implanted device team assumed that any command sent to the device was authorized because the range was so short. They did not consider that the range could be extended through the device accessories.   The WCA design team assumed that the Tablet would never send unauthorized commands or firmware updates because it only connected to the company’s server and used secure communications. Furthermore, it was assumed that nobody would go to the trouble to reverse engineer the WCA’s firmware. They also did not realize a look-alike application could be placed on the web, and social engineering attacks could get the patient to download it. They followed the “UserID/Password” model because that is what they were accustomed to and did not realize it did not authenticate the server (only the user). They also assumed the Tablet could be trusted because it was from a major manufacturer. They did not realize that users could install malicious applications by accident.   The Tablet team assumed that they would only communicate with the company’s server and didn’t realize that there were MITM attacks that could redirect their server IP address look-up to a hostile server.  The server team assumed that if they were given the correct UserID/Password, then this was an authorized user and appropriate access was provided. They assumed the Tablet would never send a command that could be harmful to the database integrity.  Design Considerations: Did you consider server attacks in your analysis? What security controls could mitigate damage from an attacker’s knowledge of a UserID and Password?  The lack of a security risk analysis contributed to not knowing what should be protected. Hence, it was decided to protect everything to a convenient degree not realizing that they could not protect the entire system and their measures could be used in combination to create an effective attack.  The server was not authenticated to the user, which allowed the attacker to substitute their own server. The software and firmware downloads were also not authenticated because the designers assumed the secure communication channel would guarantee delivery of correct updates. The application was not authenticated or signed, therefore the Tablet could not distinguish it from the attacker’s app.  There was incomplete application of “Least Privilege”. While the server assigned roles based on UserID and Password, the In Home Monitor (IHM) was designed to send commands to the implanted device based on the programming. Only patient-safe commands were to be programmed. However, a change to the application could allow IHM to send any possible command to the device. This created a hazardous scenario when an attacker was present, while there was no such scenario with just the authorized user.  Design Considerations: Where should final authentication and authorization be performed? What is the location of the last security control before a therapy change (potentially beneficial or harmful) occurs? The importance of this question cannot be understated.   The answer is that the final authorization is performed at the point of therapy delivery. A security risk assessment, that includes a comprehensive security architecture, would have identified hazards of allowing an untrusted device to perform any operation on the medical device. It would have shown that a system with good security practices would have classified the risks associated with each possible command, and each classification of user would only be allowed to use commands appropriate to their job.   The analysis also would have shown that the authentication/permission process needs to be performed as close as possible to the medical therapy that could create the hazard. If it cannot be done in the implanted device, then the external accessory must be designed for security and have a robust mechanism for authenticating itself with the implanted device.  The easy availability of the app allowed the attacker to reverse engineer it and create his own app. Any secure system should not depend on hiding its design; the lack of design information increases the attacker’s effort and required skill level, thus reducing the set of potential attackers.  The availability of the WCA on the used market allowed reverse engineering to extract design information required to create a modified app.  Design Considerations: Could the WCA’s hardware selection provide a security control that would make reverse engineering more challenging? Security requires the combined effort of the entire design team, including electrical, mechanical, and software/firmware. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016  63 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016 Because the attacker obtained the patient’s UserID and Password, they were able to mimic the patient to the server using their own PC-based software. If they could do this for a large number of patients, they have the ability to access and modify large amounts of patient information.  Design Considerations: What security controls could be placed on the server to limit the attacker’s benefit of knowing a number of UserIDs and Passwords?  E.7.3.5 Security Risk Controls This subclause considers security risk controls that could be implemented. After implementing the controls, the security risk assessment should be updated along with the overall risk assessment as the controls have the potential to introduce or modify other safety-related risks. a) Use two-way authentication to authenticate the Tablet application to the Server and the Server to the application. Each Tablet application installation is provided with a server (PKI) certificate that is used to authenticate the server. Similarly, the server authenticates the Tablet using the Tablet’s unique certificate. b) Implement code signing on software and firmware. Use a hash function to verify that the firmware or software is correct. The hash is signed with a private key owned by the manufacturer. The firmware and software contains the public key to verify the hash and thus verify that the update is authentic. c) The Tablet application must perform a two-way authentication with the WCA. Each WCA is provided with a unique key or certificate known by the authorized server. The Tablet application is not allowed to communicate with the WCA or the Server until it has authenticated itself with the WCA. d) The Tablet’s application software uses a hardware key or certificate store to prevent another app from obtaining its credentials. e) The application software is obfuscated or protected by other software to make reverse engineering more difficult. While this is not a complete solution, a difficult attack may make the product less susceptible. (The attacker will generally seek out the easiest products to attack that achieve their objective.) f) Move safety-critical calculations and decisions to the WCA, the Server, or the Device. Reducing the capability of the Tablet app reduces the value obtained from reverse engineering. g) Use a microprocessor on the WCA where the firmware cannot be read either through the conventional communication channels or through the processor’s debugging port. Disable any debug capability that allows firmware or data to be changed via the debugging port. h) Make it “expensive” to reverse engineer the WCA by using strong, thermally insensitive epoxies that require things to break in order to access critical electronic elements. i) Use a secure chip to uniquely identify the WCA. This can also mitigate issues with counterfeit product.  64 © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ AAMI TIR57:2016 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 09/08/2016Annex F (informative) A comparison of terminology between key referenced standards The following table compares the basic terms of risk management as defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007, NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (see Bibliography [53]), IEC 80001-1:2010 and this TIR.
