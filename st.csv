Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. IEEE Standards documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards through a consensus development process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the Institute and serve without compensation. While the IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process, the IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information contained in its standards. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of ISO/IEC JTC 1 is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of this standard may require the use of subject matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no position is taken with respect to the existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. ISO/IEEE is not responsible for identifying essential patents or patent claims for which a license may be required, for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of patents or patent claims or determining whether any licensing terms or conditions provided in connection with submission of a Letter of Assurance or a Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration Form, if any, or in any licensing agreements are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Users of this standard are expressly advised that determination of the validity of any patent rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely their own responsibility. Further information may be obtained from ISO or the IEEE Standards Association. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 7, Software and systems engineering, in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Systems and Software Engineering Standards Committee, under the Partner Standards Development Organization cooperation agreement between ISO and IEEE. This first edition of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 cancels and replaces the ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (second edition), which has been technically revised. Changes in this revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 were developed in conjunction with a corresponding revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, Systems and software engineering – Software life cycle processes.  The purpose of these revisions is to accomplish the harmonization of the structures and contents of the two International Standards, while supporting the requirements of the assessment community.   This International Standard was developed with the following goals:  provide a common terminology between the revision of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,  where applicable, provide common process names and process structure between the revision of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,  enable the user community to evolve towards fully harmonized standards, while maximizing backward compatibility. This revision is intended to achieve a fully harmonized view of the system and software life cycle processes.

This has led to new opportunities, but also to increased challenges for the organizations that create and utilize systems.  These challenges exist throughout the life cycle of a system and at all levels of architectural detail.  This International Standard provides a common process framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans, adopting a Systems Engineering approach. Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining stakeholder needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem. It integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. It considers both the business and the technical needs of all stakeholders with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the needs of users and other applicable stakeholders. This life cycle spans the conception of ideas through to the retirement of a system.  It provides the processes for acquiring and supplying systems. It helps to improve communication and cooperation among the parties that create, utilize and manage modern systems in order that they can work in an integrated, coherent fashion.  In addition, this framework provides for the assessment and improvement of the life cycle processes. The processes in this International Standard form a comprehensive set from which an organization can construct system life cycle models appropriate to its products and services.  An organization, depending on its purpose, can select and apply an appropriate subset to fulfill that purpose. This International Standard can be used in one or more of the following modes:  By an organization — to help establish an environment of desired processes.  These processes can be supported by an infrastructure of methods, procedures, techniques, tools and trained personnel.  The organization may then employ this environment to perform and manage its projects and progress systems through their life cycle stages.  In this mode this International Standard is used to assess conformance of a declared, established environment to its provisions.  By a project — to help select, structure and employ the elements of an established environment to provide products and services.  In this mode this International Standard is used in the assessment of conformance of the project to the declared and established environment.  By an acquirer and a supplier — to help develop an agreement concerning processes and activities.  Via the agreement, the processes and activities in this International Standard are selected, negotiated, agreed to and performed.  In this mode this International Standard is used for guidance in developing the agreement.  By process assessors — to serve as a process reference model for use in the performance of process assessments that may be used to support organizational process improvement.

This standard replaces ISO/IEC/IEEE Std 15288™-2008, Systems and software engineering—System life cycle processes.  That standard replaced IEEE Std 15288™-2004, Adoption of ISO/IEC 15288:2002, Systems and software engineering—System life cycle processes. The original ISO/IEC 15288 was published in November 2002 and was the first international standard to provide a comprehensive set of life cycle processes for systems.    This new revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 is the product of a coordinated effort by IEEE and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7. The base document for the revision is the ISO/IEC/IEEE standard. Development of this revision was carefully coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2015 to align structure, terms, and corresponding organizational and project processes.  This revised standard is a step in the SC7 harmonization strategy to achieve a fully integrated suite of system and software life cycle processes and guidance for their application. It is also an important step in the shared strategy of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 and the IEEE to harmonize their respective collections of standards.

It defines a set of processes and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint.  These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system’s structure.  Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.  This is accomplished through the involvement of all stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. This International Standard also provides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the system life cycle processes used within an organization or a project.  Organizations and projects can use these processes when acquiring and supplying systems. This International Standard concerns those systems that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following system elements: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities. When a system element is software, the software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2015 may be used to implement that system element.  The two standards are harmonized for concurrent use on a single project or in a single organization.  1.2 Purpose  The purpose of this International Standard is to provide a defined set of processes to facilitate communication among acquirers, suppliers and other stakeholders in the life cycle of a system. This International Standard applies to organizations in their roles as both acquirers and suppliers.  It can be used by a single organization in a self-imposed mode or in a multi-party situation.  Parties can be from the same organization or from different organizations and the situation can range from an informal agreement to a formal contract. The processes in this International Standard can be used as a basis for establishing business environments, e.g., methods, procedures, techniques, tools and trained personnel. Annex A provides normative direction regarding the tailoring of these system life cycle processes. 1.3 Field of application This International Standard applies to the full life cycle of systems, including conception, development, production, utilization, support and retirement of systems, and to the acquisition and supply of systems, whether performed internally or externally to an organization.  The life cycle processes of this International Standard can be applied concurrently, iteratively and recursively to a system and incrementally to its elements.  There is a wide variety of systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application, complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans and evolution.  This International Standard describes the processes that comprise the life cycle of man-made systems. It therefore applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass-produced systems and customized, adaptable systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone system and to systems that are embedded and integrated into larger more complex and complete systems. This International Standard provides a process reference model characterized in terms of the process purpose and the process outcomes that result from the successful execution of the activity tasks. Annex B lists examples of artifacts and information items that may be associated with various processes. This International Standard can therefore be used as a reference model to support process assessment as specified in ISO/IEC Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  2  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved 15504-2:2003. Annex C provides information regarding the use of the system life cycle processes as a process reference model. Annex D describes the process constructs for use in the process reference model. 1.4 Limitations This International Standard does not prescribe a specific system life cycle model, development methodology, method, model or technique. The users of this International Standard are responsible for selecting a life cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities, and tasks in this International Standard into that model. The parties are also responsible for selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques suitable for the project.  Although this International Standard does not establish a management system, it is intended to be compatible with the quality management system provided by ISO 9001, the service management system provided by ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013), and the information security management system provided by ISO/IEC 27000. This International Standard does not detail information items in terms of name, format, explicit content and recording media. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 addresses the content for life cycle process information items (documentation). 2 Conformance 2.1 Intended usage The requirements in this International Standard are contained in Clause 6 and Annex A.  This International Standard provides requirements for a number of processes suitable for usage during the life cycle of a system or product. It is recognized that particular projects or organizations may not need to use all of the processes provided by this International Standard. Therefore, implementation of this International Standard typically involves selecting and declaring a set of processes suitable to the organization or project.  There are two ways that an implementation can be claimed to conform to the provisions of this International Standard – full conformance and tailored conformance.  There are two criteria for claiming full conformance. Achieving either criterion suffices for conformance, although the chosen criterion (or criteria) is to be stated in the claim. Claiming “full conformance to tasks” asserts that all of the requirements of the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes are achieved. Alternatively, claiming “full conformance to outcomes” asserts that all of the required outcomes of the declared set of processes are achieved. Full conformance to outcomes permits greater freedom in the implementation of conforming processes and may be useful for implementing processes to be used in the context of an innovative life cycle model. NOTE 1 Options for conformance are provided for needed flexibility in the application of this International Standard. Each process has a set of objectives (phrased as “outcomes”) and a set of activities and tasks that represent one way to achieve the objectives. NOTE 2 Users who implement the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes can assert full conformance to tasks of the selected processes. Some users, however, might have innovative process variants that achieve the objectives (i.e., the outcomes) of the declared set of processes without implementing all of the activities and tasks. These users can assert full conformance to the outcomes of the declared set of processes. The two criteria—conformance to task and conformance to outcome—are necessarily not equivalent since specific performance of activities and tasks may require, in some cases, a higher level of capability than just the achievement of outcomes. NOTE 3 When this International Standard is used to help develop an agreement between an acquirer and a supplier, clauses of this International Standard can be selected for incorporation in the agreement with or without modification.  In this case, it is more appropriate for the acquirer and supplier to claim compliance with the agreement than conformance with this International Standard. NOTE 4 An organization (for example, national, industrial association, company) imposing this International Standard as a condition of trade can specify and make public the minimum set of required processes, outcomes, activities, and tasks, which constitute suppliers' compliance with the conditions of trade.

Full conformance to outcomes is achieved by demonstrating that all of the outcomes of the declared set of processes have been achieved. In this situation, the provisions for activities and tasks of the declared set of processes are guidance rather than requirements, regardless of the verb form that is used in the provision. NOTE One intended use of this International Standard is to facilitate process assessment and improvement. For this purpose, the objectives of each process are written in the form of 'outcomes' compatible with the provisions of ISO/IEC 15504-2 and ISO/IEC 33002. Those standards provide for the assessment of the processes of this International Standard, providing a basis for improvement. Users intending process assessment and improvement may use the process outcomes written in this International Standard as the ""process reference model"" required by ISO/IEC 15504-2 and ISO/IEC 33002.  2.2.2 Full conformance to tasks A claim of full conformance declares the set of processes for which conformance is claimed. Full conformance to tasks is achieved by demonstrating that all of the requirements of the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes have been achieved. In this situation, the provisions for the outcomes of the declared set of processes are guidance rather than requirements, regardless of the verb form that is used in the provision. NOTE A claim of full conformance to tasks may be appropriate in contractual situations where an acquirer or a regulator requires detailed understanding of the suppliers‘ processes. 2.3 Tailored conformance When this International Standard is used as a basis for establishing a set of processes that do not qualify for full conformance, the clauses of this International Standard are selected or modified in accordance with the tailoring process prescribed in Annex A.  The tailored text, for which tailored conformance is claimed, is declared.  Tailored conformance is achieved by demonstrating that the outcomes, activities, and tasks, as tailored, have been achieved. 3 Normative references None. 4 Terms, definitions, and abbreviated terms 4.1 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) and 24748-2 (IEEE Std 24748-2-2012) guides on the application of life cycle management. 5.2 System concepts 5.2.1 Systems The systems considered in this International Standard are man-made, created and utilized to provide products or services in defined environments for the benefit of users and other stakeholders.  These systems may be configured with one or more of the following system elements: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities .  As viewed by the user, they are thought of as products or services. The perception and definition of a particular system, its architecture and its system elements depend on a stakeholder's interests and responsibilities.  One stakeholder's system-of-interest can be viewed as a system element in another stakeholder's system-of-interest.  Furthermore, a system-of-interest can be viewed as being part of the environment for another stakeholder's system-of-interest. The following are key points regarding the characteristics of the systems-of-interest: a) defined boundaries encapsulate meaningful needs and practical solutions; b) there is a hierarchical or other relationship between system elements; c) an entity at any level in the system-of-interest can be viewed as a system; d) a system comprises an integrated, defined set of subordinate system elements; e) humans can be viewed as both users external to a system and as system elements (i.e., operators) within a system; f) a system can be viewed in isolation as an entity, i.e., a product; or as a collection of functions capable of interacting with its surrounding environment, i.e., a set of services. Whatever the boundaries chosen to define the system, the concepts in this International Standard are generic and permit a practitioner to correlate or adapt individual instances of life cycles to its system principles. 5.2.2 System structure The system life cycle processes in this International Standard are described in relation to a system (see Figure 1) that is composed of a set of interacting system elements, each of which can be implemented to fulfill its respective specified requirements.  Responsibility for the implementation of any system element may therefore be delegated to another party through an agreement.

For more complex systems-of-interest, a prospective system element may itself need to be considered as a system (that in turn is comprised of system elements) before a complete set of system elements can be defined with confidence (see Figure 2).  In this manner, the appropriate system life cycle processes are applied recursively to a system-of-interest to resolve its structure to the point where understandable and manageable system elements can be implemented (made, bought, or reused).  While Figures 1 and 2 imply a hierarchical relationship, in reality there are an increasing number of systems that, from one or more aspects, are not hierarchical, such as networks and other distributed systems. Annex G discusses the concept of a system of systems (SoS).  Figure 2 — System-of-interest structure 5.2.3 Enabling systems Throughout the life cycle of a system-of-interest, essential services are required from systems that are not directly a part of the operational environment of the system-of interest, e.g., mass-production system, training system, maintenance system.  Each of these systems enables a part, e.g., a stage of the life cycle of the system-of-interest to be conducted.  Termed ""enabling systems"", they facilitate progression of the system-of-interest through its life cycle. The relationship between the services delivered to the operational environment by the system-of-interest and the services delivered by the enabling systems to the system-of-interest are shown in Figure 3.  Enabling systems can be seen to contribute indirectly to the services provided by the system-of-interest.  The interrelationships between the system-of-interest and the enabling systems can be bi-directional or a one-way relationship.  In addition to interacting with enabling systems, the system-of-interest may also interact with other systems in the operating environment, shown as Systems A, B, and C.  Requirements for interfaces with enabling systems and other systems in the operational environment will need to be included in the requirements for the system-of-interest.

Since they are interdependent, they can also be viewed as a system.  When a suitable enabling system does not already exist, the project that is responsible for the system-of-interest can also be directly responsible for creating and using the enabling system. Creating the enabling systems can be viewed as a separate project and subsequently another system-of-interest. Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes. 5.3 Organization and project concepts 5.3.1 Organizations When an organization, as a whole or a part, enters into an agreement, it is sometimes called a “party” to the agreement. Parties may be from the same organization or from separate organizations. An organization may be as small as a single individual, if the individual is assigned responsibilities and authorities. In informal terms, the organization that is responsible for executing a process is sometimes referred to by the name of that process. For example, the organization executing the Acquisition process is sometimes called the “acquirer”. Other examples include supplier, implementer, maintainer, and operator. A few other terms are applied to organizations in this standard: ""user"" can be the organization that benefits from the utilization of the product or service; ""customer"" refers to the user and acquirer collectively; and ""stakeholder"" refers to an individual or organization with an interest in the system. The processes and organizations are only related functionally.  The standard does not dictate or imply a structure for an organization, nor does it specify that particular processes are to be executed by particular parts of the organization. It is the responsibility of the organization that implements the standard to define a suitable structure for the organization and assign appropriate roles for the execution of processes. The processes in this standard form a comprehensive set to serve various organizations. An organization, small or large, depending on its business purpose or its acquisition strategy, can select an appropriate set of the processes (and associated activities and tasks) to fulfill that purpose. An organization may perform one process or more than one process.  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  13 Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  14  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved This standard is intended to be applied by an organization internally or externally by two or more organizations. When applied internally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of an agreement that may vary in formality under different circumstances. When applied externally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of a contract. This standard uses the term “agreement” to apply to either situation. For the purpose of this standard, any project is assumed to be conducted within the context of an organization. This is important because a project is dependent upon various outcomes produced by the business processes of the organization, e.g., employees to staff the project and facilities to house the project. For this purpose, this standard provides a set of “Organizational Project-Enabling” processes. These processes are not assumed to be adequate to operate a business; instead the processes, considered as a collection, are intended to state the minimum set of dependencies that the project places upon the organization. 5.3.2 Organization and project-level adoption Modern businesses strive to develop a robust set of life cycle processes that are applied repeatedly to the projects of the business. Therefore, this standard is intended to be useful for adoption at either the organization level or at the project level. An organization would adopt the standard and supplement it with appropriate procedures, practices, tools and policies. A project of the organization would typically conform to the organization's processes rather than conform directly to this standard. In some cases, projects may be executed by an organization that does not have an appropriate set of processes adopted at the organizational level. Such a project may apply the provisions of this standard directly to the project. 5.4 Life cycle concepts 5.4.1 System life cycle model Every system has a life cycle.  A life cycle can be described using an abstract functional model that represents the conceptualization of a need for the system, its realization, utilization, evolution and disposal. A system progresses through its life cycle as the result of actions, performed and managed by people in organizations, using processes for execution of these actions. The detail in the life cycle model is expressed in terms of these processes, their outcomes, relationships and sequence.  This International Standard does not prescribe any particular life cycle model. Instead it defines a set of processes, termed life cycle processes, that can be used in the definition of the system's life cycle. Also, this International Standard does not prescribe any particular sequence of processes within the life cycle model. The sequence of the processes is determined by project objectives and by selection of the system life cycle model. 5.4.2 System life cycle stages Life cycles vary according to the nature, purpose, use and prevailing circumstances of the system. Each stage has a distinct purpose and contribution to the whole life cycle and is considered when planning and executing the system life cycle. The stages represent the major life cycle periods associated with a system and they relate to the state of the system description or the system itself. The stages describe the major progress and achievement milestones of the system through its life cycle.  They give rise to the primary decision gates of the life cycle. These decision gates are used by organizations to understand and manage the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with costs, schedule and functionality when creating or utilizing a system. The stages thus provide organizations with a framework within which organization management has high-level visibility and control of project and technical processes. Per ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011), the typical system life cycle stages include concept, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement. Organizations employ stages differently to satisfy contrasting business and risk mitigation strategies.  Using stages concurrently and in different orders can lead to life cycle forms with distinctly different characteristics.   Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle management.

Additional detail regarding this form of process description can be found in ISO/IEC TR 24774. 5.5.3 General characteristics of processes In addition to the basic attributes described in the previous subclause, processes may be characterized by other attributes common to all processes. ISO/IEC 15504-2 identifies common process attributes that characterize six levels of achievement within a measurement framework for process capability. Annex C of this International Standard includes the list of process attributes that contribute to the achievement of higher levels of process capability as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2 5.5.4 Tailoring Annex A, which is normative, defines the basic activities needed to perform tailoring of this International Standard. Note that tailoring may diminish the perceived value of a claim of conformance to this standard. This is because it is difficult for other organizations to understand the extent to which tailoring may have deleted desirable provisions. An organization asserting a single-party claim of conformance to this standard may find it advantageous to claim full conformance to a smaller list of processes rather than tailored conformance to a larger list of processes. 5.6 Processes in this standard 5.6.1 Introduction This International Standard groups the activities that can be performed during the life cycle of a system into four process groups. Each of the life cycle processes within those groups is described in terms of its purpose and desired outcomes and lists activities and tasks to be performed to achieve those outcomes. The four process groups and the processes included in each group are depicted in Figure 4. The processes described in this International Standard are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that organizations find useful. A description of each process group is provided in the four subclauses that follow.

One organization (acting as an acquirer) can task another (acting as a supplier) for products or services.  This is achieved using agreements. Generally, organizations act simultaneously or successively as both acquirers and suppliers of systems. The Agreement Processes can be used with less formality when the acquirer and the supplier are in the same organization.  Similarly, they can be used within the organization to agree on the respective responsibilities of organization, project and technical functions.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. 5.6.3 Organizational project-enabling processes The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are concerned with providing the resources needed to enable the project to meet the needs and expectations of the organization’s interested parties.  The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are typically concerned at a strategic level with the management and improvement of the organization’s business or undertaking, with the provision and deployment of resources and assets, and with its management of risks in competitive or uncertain situations.   The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes establish the environment in which projects are conducted. The organization establishes the processes and life cycle models to be used by projects; establishes, redirects, or cancels projects; provides resources required, including human and financial; and sets and monitors the quality measures for systems and other deliverables that are developed by projects for internal and external customers.  The Organizational Project-Enabling Processes create a strong business image for many organizations and imply commercial and profit-making motives.  Nevertheless, the Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are equally relevant to non-profit organizations, since they are also accountable to stakeholders, are responsible for resources and encounter risk in their undertakings.  This International Standard can be applied to non-profit organizations as well as to profit-making organizations.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. 5.6.4 Technical management processes The Technical Management Processes are concerned with managing the resources and assets allocated by organization management and with applying them to fulfill the agreements into which the organization or organizations enter. The Technical Management Processes relate to the technical effort of projects, in particular to planning in terms of cost, timescales and achievements, to the checking of actions to help ensure that they comply with plans and performance criteria, and to the identification and selection of corrective actions that recover shortfalls in progress and achievement. They are used to establish and perform technical plans for the project, manage information across the technical team, assess technical progress against the plans for the system products or services, control technical tasks through to completion, and to aid in the decision-making process. NOTE 1 Technical management is ‘the application of technical and administrative resources to plan, organize and control engineering functions’ (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010). Typically several projects will co-exist in any one organization. The Technical Management Processes can be employed at a corporate level to meet internal needs.  Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group. NOTE 2 Technical Management Processes are applied during the performance of each Technical Process. 5.6.5 Technical processes The Technical Processes are concerned with technical actions throughout the life cycle.  Technical Processes transform the needs of stakeholders into a product and service. By applying that product or operating that service, technical processes provide sustainable performance, when and where needed, in order to meet the stakeholder requirements and achieve customer satisfaction.  The Technical Processes are applied in order to create and use a system, whether it is in the form of a model or is a finished product. The Technical Processes apply at any level in a hierarchy of system structure and at any stage in the life cycle.   Figure 4 lists the processes contained in this process group.

They can be applied at any level in a system’s hierarchy and at any stage in the life cycle. The functions these processes perform are defined in terms of specific purposes, outcomes and the set of activities and tasks that constitute the process. Each life cycle process in Figure 4 can be invoked, as required, at any time throughout the life cycle. The order that the processes are presented in this standard does not imply any prescriptive order in their use. However, sequential relationships are introduced by the definition of a life cycle model. The detailed purpose and timing of use of these processes throughout the life cycle are influenced by multiple factors, including social, trading, organizational and technical considerations, each of which can vary during the life of a system.  An individual system life cycle is thus a complex system of processes that will normally possess concurrent, iterative, recursive and time dependent characteristics. Concurrent use of processes can exist within a project (e.g., when design actions and preparatory actions for building a system are performed at the same time), and between projects (e.g., when system elements are designed at the same time under different project responsibilities). When the application of the same process or set of processes is repeated on the same system, the application is referred to as iterative. The iterative use of processes is important for the progressive refinement of process outputs, e.g., the interaction between successive verification actions and integration actions can incrementally build confidence in the conformance of the product. Iteration is not only appropriate but also expected. New information is created by the application of a process or set of processes. Typically this information takes the form of questions with respect to requirements, analyzed risks or opportunities. Such questions should be resolved before completing the activities of a process or set of processes. The recursive use of processes, i.e., the repeated application of the same process or set of processes applied to successive levels of system elements in a system’s structure, is a key aspect of the application of this International Standard.  The outputs of processes at any level, whether information, artifacts or services, are inputs to the processes used at the level below (e.g., during top down design) or level above (e.g., during system realization). The outcomes from one application are used as inputs to the next lower (or higher) system in the system structure to arrive at a more detailed or mature set of outcomes. Such an approach adds value to successive systems in the system structure. The changing nature of the influences on the system (e.g., operational environment changes, new opportunities for system element implementation, modified structure and responsibilities in organizations) requires continual review of the selection and timing of process use.  Process use in the life cycle can be dynamic, responding to the many external influences on the system. The life cycle approach also allows for incorporating the changes in the next stage. The life cycle stages assist the planning, execution and management of life cycle processes in the face of this complexity in life cycles by providing comprehensible and recognizable high-level purpose and structure. The set of processes within a life cycle stage are applied with the common goal of satisfying the exit criteria for that stage or the entry criteria of the formal progress reviews within that stage.  The discussion in this section on iterative and recursive use of the system life cycle processes is not meant to imply any specific hierarchical, vertical, or horizontal structure for the system-of-interest, enabling system, organization, or project.  Where justified by product quality risks, detailed descriptions of process instances in the context of the specific product may also be created.  Instantiation of processes involves identifying specific success criteria for a process instance, derived from the product requirements, and identifying the specific activities and tasks needed to achieve the success criteria, derived from the activities and tasks identified in this standard. Creating detailed descriptions of process instances enables better management of product quality risks by establishing the link between the process and the specific product requirements. Further elaboration of these concepts can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes.

The PRM is applicable to an organization that is assessing its processes in order to determine the capability of these processes. The purpose and outcomes are a statement of the goals of the performance of each process. This statement of goals permits assessment of the effectiveness of the processes in ways other than simple conformity assessment. NOTE In this International Standard, the term “Process Reference Model” is used with the same meaning as ISO/IEC 15504-2. 6 System life cycle processes 6.1 Agreement processes This subclause specifies the requirements for the establishment of agreements with organizational entities external and internal to the organization. The Agreement Processes consist of the following: a) Acquisition process – used by organizations for acquiring products or services; b) Supply process – used by organizations for supplying products or services. These processes define the activities necessary to establish an agreement between two organizations. If the Acquisition process is invoked, it provides the means for conducting business with a supplier. This may include products that are supplied for use as an operational system, services in support of operational activities, or elements of a system being provided by a supplier. If the Supply process is invoked, it provides the means for an agreement in which the result is a product or service that is provided to the acquirer. NOTE Security is an increasing concern in systems engineering. See ISO/IEC 27036, Security techniques — Information security for supplier relationships, for requirements and guidance for suppliers and acquirers on how to secure information in supplier relationships. Specific aspects of information security supplier relationships are addressed in Parts 3 and Part 4. 6.1.1 Acquisition process 6.1.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Acquisition process is to obtain a product or service in accordance with the acquirer's requirements. NOTE As part of this process, the agreement is modified when a change request is agreed to by both the acquirer and supplier. 6.1.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Acquisition process: a) A request for supply is prepared. b) One or more suppliers are selected. c) An agreement is established between the acquirer and supplier. d) A product or service complying with the agreement is accepted. e) Acquirer obligations defined in the agreement are satisfied. 6.1.1.3 Activities and tasks The acquirer shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Acquisition process.

This activity consists of the following tasks:  1) Define a strategy for how the acquisition will be conducted. NOTE This strategy describes or references the life cycle model, risks and issues mitigation, a schedule of milestones, and selection criteria if the supplier is external to the acquiring organization. It also includes key drivers and characteristics of the acquisition, such as responsibilities and liabilities; specific models, methods, or processes; level of criticality; formality; and priority of relevant trade factors. 2) Prepare a request for the supply of a product or service that includes the requirements. NOTE 1 If a supplier is external to the organization, then the request includes the business practices with which a supplier is expected to comply and the criteria for selecting a supplier. NOTE 2 A definition of requirements is provided to one or more suppliers. The requirements are the stakeholder or the system requirements, depending on the type of acquisition approach, through the associated requirements definition process. NOTE 3 The acquirer develops the requirements by itself or retains a supplier to develop them. If the acquirer retains a supplier to develop requirements, the acquirer retains approval authority for the requirements developed by the supplier. b) Advertise the acquisition and select the supplier.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Communicate the request for the supply of a product or service to potential suppliers. 2) Select one or more suppliers. NOTE To obtain competitive solicitations, proposals to supply are evaluated and compared against the selection criteria and ranked.  The justification for rating each proposal is declared and suppliers are informed why they were or were not selected. c) Establish and maintain an agreement.  This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Project cost, schedule, and performance are monitored through the Project Assessment and Control process.  Any identified issues that require agreement modifications are referred to this activity.  Any proposals for changes to system elements or information are controlled through the Change Management activity of the Configuration Management process.  1) Develop an agreement with the supplier that includes acceptance criteria. NOTE 1 This agreement ranges in formality from a written contract to a verbal agreement.  Appropriate to the level of formality, the agreement establishes requirements, development and delivery milestones, verification, validation and acceptance conditions, exception-handling procedures, agreement change management procedures and payment schedules, so that both parties of the agreement understand the basis for executing the agreement.  Rights and restrictions associated with technical data and intellectual property are noted in the agreement.  Details are discussed and changed during negotiation, after which the acquirer and supplier accept the terms of an agreement and the agreement commences. For a written contract, this occurs when the contract is signed. NOTE 2 The agreement identifies any process requirements that need to be imposed on participating subcontractors, such as configuration management requirements, reporting of risks, and reporting of measures and measurement analysis. 2) Identify necessary changes to the agreement. NOTE In requesting a change to the agreement, the acquirer or the supplier details its specifications, rationale, and background. 3) Evaluate impact of changes on the agreement.

NOTE Agreement terms are negotiated between the acquirer and supplier.  Negotiation occurs for the initial agreement, and as required for any changes.  Changed agreements are based on the required change and identified impacts.   5) Update the agreement with the supplier, as necessary. NOTE The result of the agreement modification is incorporated into the project plans and communicated to all affected parties. d) Monitor the agreement.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess the execution of the agreement. NOTE This includes confirmation that all parties are meeting their responsibilities according to the agreement.  The Project Assessment and Control process is used to evaluate projected cost, schedule, performance, and the impact of undesirable outcomes on the organization.  This information is combined with other assessments of the execution of the terms of the agreement. 2) Provide data needed by the supplier and resolve issues in a timely manner. e) Accept the product or service.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Confirm that the delivered product or service complies with the agreement. NOTE Exceptions that arise during the conduct of the agreement or with the delivered product or service are resolved according to the procedures established in the agreement. 2) Provide payment or other agreed consideration. 3) Accept the product or service from the supplier, or other party, as directed by the agreement. 4) Close the agreement. NOTE The project is closed by the Portfolio Management process. 6.1.2 Supply process 6.1.2.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Supply process is to provide an acquirer with a product or service that meets agreed requirements. NOTE As part of this process, the agreement is modified when a change request is agreed to by both the acquirer and supplier. 6.1.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Supply process: a) An acquirer for a product or service is identified. b) A response to the acquirer's request is produced. c) An agreement is established between the acquirer and supplier. d) A product or service is provided. e) Supplier obligations defined in the agreement are satisfied.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Determine the existence and identity of an acquirer who has a need for a product or service. NOTE This is often generated through the Business or Mission Analysis process. For a product or service developed for consumers, an agent, e.g., a marketing function within the supplier organization, often represents the acquirer. 2) Define a supply strategy. NOTE This strategy describes or references the life cycle model, risks and issues mitigation, and a schedule of milestones. It also includes key drivers and characteristics of the acquisition such as responsibilities and liabilities; specific models; methods or processes; level of criticality; formality; and priority of relevant trade factors. b) Respond to a tender.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Evaluate a request for the supply of a product or service to determine feasibility and how to respond. 2) Prepare a response that satisfies the solicitation. c) Establish and maintain an agreement.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Negotiate an agreement with the acquirer that includes acceptance criteria. NOTE This agreement ranges in formality from a written contract to a verbal agreement. The Supplier confirms that the requirements, delivery milestones and acceptance conditions are achievable, that exception handling and agreement change management procedures and payment schedules are acceptable, and that they establish a basis for executing the agreement without unnecessary risks. Any issues are discussed and resolved during negotiation, after which the acquirer and supplier accept the terms of an agreement and the agreement commences. For a contract, this occurs when the contract is signed. 2) Identify necessary changes to the agreement. NOTE In requesting a change to the agreement, the acquirer or the supplier details its specifications, rationale, and background.   3) Evaluate impact of changes on the agreement. NOTE Any change is investigated for impacts to project plans, schedule, cost, technical capability, or quality. A change can be handled within the existing agreement, can require a modification to the agreement, or can require a new agreement. 4) Negotiate the agreement with the acquirer. NOTE Changes to any agreement terms are negotiated between the supplier and acquirer. This includes changes due to changing market context. Negotiation occurs for the initial agreement, and as required for any changes. Changed agreements are based on the required change and identified impacts. 5) Update the agreement with the acquirer, as necessary. NOTE The result of the agreement modification is incorporated into the project plans and communicated to all affected parties. d) Execute the agreement.

This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE The detail of the life cycle implementation within a project is dependent upon the complexity of the work, the methods used, and the skills and training of personnel involved in performing the work.  A project tailors policies, processes, models, and procedures according to its requirements and needs, while maintaining alignment with regulations and organizational policies.  Annex A contains information on tailoring. 1) Establish policies and procedures for process management and deployment that are consistent with organizational strategies. 2) Establish the processes that implement the requirements of this international standard and that are consistent with organizational strategies. 3) Define the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities to facilitate implementation of processes and the strategic management of life cycles.  4) Define business criteria that control progression through the life cycle. NOTE The decision-making criteria regarding entering and exiting each life cycle stage and key milestones are established. These are sometimes expressed in terms of business achievement.  5) Establish standard life cycle models for the organization that are comprised of stages, and define the purpose and outcomes for each stage.  NOTE The life cycle model comprises one or more stage models, as needed. It is assembled as a sequence of stages that overlap or iterate, as appropriate for the system-of-interest's scope, magnitude, complexity, changing needs and opportunities. Stages are illustrated in the ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) guide using a commonly encountered example of life cycle stages. Specific examples for systems are provided in ISO/IEC TR 24748-2 (IEEE Std 24748-2-2012). The life cycle processes and activities are selected, tailored as appropriate and employed in a stage to fulfill the purpose and outcomes of that stage.  b) Assess the process.  This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE ISO/IEC 15504 provides a more detailed set of process assessment activities and tasks that are aligned with the tasks shown below. 1) Monitor process execution across the organization. NOTE This includes the analysis of process measures and review of trends with respect to business criteria, feedback from the projects regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes, and monitoring execution according to regulations and organizational policies.  2) Conduct periodic reviews of the life cycle models used by the projects.

Individual Technical Management Processes may be invoked at any time in the life cycle and at any level in a hierarchy of projects, as required by plans or unforeseen events. The Technical Management Processes are applied with a level of rigor and formality that depends on the risk and complexity of the project. The scope of a technical management process is the technical management of a project or its products, to include the system. NOTE This set of technical management processes are performed so that system-specific technical processes can be conducted effectively.  They do not comprise a management system or a comprehensive set of processes for project management, as that is not the scope of this standard.  The Technical Management Processes consist of the following: a) Project Planning process; b) Project Assessment and Control process; c) Decision Management process; d) Risk Management process; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  32  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved e) Configuration Management process; f) Information Management process; g) Measurement process; h) Quality Assurance process. Project Planning and Project Assessment and Control are key to all management practices. These processes establish the general approach for managing a project or a process. The other processes in this group provide a specific focused set of tasks for performing to a specialized management objective. They are all evident in the management of any undertaking, ranging from a complete organization down to a single life cycle process and its tasks. In this International Standard, the project has been chosen as the context for describing processes. The same processes can also be applied in the performance of services. 6.3.1 Project planning process 6.3.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Project Planning process is to produce and coordinate effective and workable plans.  This process determines the scope of the project management and technical activities, identifies process outputs, tasks and deliverables, establishes schedules for task conduct, including achievement criteria, and required resources to accomplish tasks.  This is an on-going process that continues throughout a project, with regular revisions to plans. NOTE The strategies defined in each of the other processes provide inputs and are integrated in the Project Planning process. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to assess whether the plans are integrated, aligned, and feasible. 6.3.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Project Planning process: a) Objectives and plans are defined. b) Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, authorities are defined. c) Resources and services necessary to achieve the objectives are formally requested and committed. d) Plans for the execution of the project are activated. 6.3.1.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Project Planning process. a) Define the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks:  1) Identify the project objectives and constraints. NOTE 1 Objectives and constraints include performance and other quality aspects, cost, time and customer satisfaction.  Each objective is identified with a level of detail that permits selection, tailoring and implementation of the appropriate processes and activities. NOTE 2 ISO/IEC 15026, Systems and software assurance, and ISO/IEC 27036, Information security for supplier relationships, provide additional guidance on objectives and constraints related to assurance and security. 2) Define the project scope as established in the agreement. NOTE  This includes all the relevant activities required to satisfy business decision criteria and complete the project successfully. A project can have responsibility for one or more stages in the complete system life cycle.

NOTE  ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011) provides detailed information regarding life cycle stages and the definition of an appropriate life cycle model.  It defines a general set of exemplar life cycle stages, including Concept, Development, Production, Utilization, Support and Retirement.  4) Establish a work breakdown structure based on the evolving system architecture. NOTE Each element of the system architecture, and appropriate processes and activities are described with a level of detail that is consistent with identified risks.  Related tasks in the work breakdown structure are grouped into project tasks.  Project tasks identify work items being developed or produced. The PMI Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures contains additional details on WBSs. 5) Define and maintain the processes that will be applied on the project. NOTE These processes are based on the defined processes of the organization (see Life Cycle Model Management process). Annex A contains information on tailoring that can be used to address project specific needs. The definition of the processes include the Entry Criteria; Inputs; Process sequence constraints (predecessor/successor relationships); Process Concurrency Requirements (what processes and tasks are worked concurrently with other process area tasks or activities); Measures of Effectiveness/Measures of Performance attributes; and Scope and Cost parameters (for critically important cost estimation). b) Plan project and technical management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define and maintain a project schedule based on management and technical objectives and work estimates. NOTE  This includes definition of the duration, relationship, dependencies and sequence of activities, achievement milestones, resources employed and the reviews and schedule reserves for risk management necessary to achieve timely completion of the project. 2) Define achievement criteria for the life cycle stage decision gates, delivery dates and major dependencies on external inputs or outputs. NOTE  The time intervals between internal reviews are defined in accordance with organizational policy on issues such as business and system criticality, schedule and technical risks. 3) Define the costs and plan a budget. NOTE  Costs are based on the schedule, labor estimates, infrastructure costs, procurement items, acquired service and enabling system estimates, and budget reserves for risk management. 4) Define roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. NOTE  This includes defining the project organization, staff acquisitions, and the development of staff skills.  Authorities include, as appropriate, the legally responsible roles and individuals, e.g., design authorization, safety authorization, and award of certification or accreditation. 5) Define the infrastructure and services required. NOTE  This includes defining the capacity needed, its availability and its allocation to project tasks.  Infrastructure includes facilities, tools, communications, and information technology assets.  The requirements for enabling systems for each life cycle stage are also specified. 6) Plan the acquisition of materials and enabling system services supplied from outside the project. NOTE  1 This includes, as necessary, plans for solicitation, supplier selection, acceptance, contract administration and contract closure.  The agreement processes are used for the planned acquisitions. NOTE 2 ISO/IEC 27036, Information security for supplier relationships, provides guidance for acquisition of infrastructure and services.

NOTE 1 Technical planning for the system is often captured in a Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP).  ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-4 provides more detail on the systems engineering technical planning and provides an annotated outline for a SEMP.   Software plans for a system are often captured in a Software Development Plan (SDP).  Planning for the project is often captured in a Project Management Plan.  ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326 provides more detail on project management.  NOTE 2 The strategy activities and tasks from each of the other processes provide inputs and are integrated in the Project Planning process. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to help ensure that the plans are integrated, aligned, and feasible. c) Activate the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks 1) Obtain authorization for the project. NOTE  The Portfolio Management process provides the authorization. 2) Submit requests and obtain commitments for necessary resources to perform the project.   3) Implement project plans.  6.3.2 Project assessment and control process 6.3.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Project Assessment and Control process is to assess if the plans are aligned and feasible; determine the status of the project, technical and process performance; and direct execution to help ensure that the performance is according to plans and schedules, within projected budgets, to satisfy technical objectives.  This process evaluates, periodically and at major events, the progress and achievements against requirements, plans and overall business objectives.  Information is provided for management action when significant variances are detected.  This process also includes redirecting the project activities and tasks, as appropriate, to correct identified deviations and variations from other technical management or technical processes.  Redirection may include re-planning as appropriate. 6.3.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Project Assessment and Control process: a) Performance measures or assessment results are available. b) Adequacy of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities is assessed. c) Adequacy of resources is assessed. d) Technical progress reviews are performed. e) Deviations in project performance from plans are investigated and analyzed. f) Affected stakeholders are informed of project status. g) Corrective action is defined and directed, when project achievement is not meeting targets. h) Project replanning is initiated, as necessary. i) Project action to progress (or not) from one scheduled milestone or event to the next is authorized. j) Project objectives are achieved.

This activity consists of the following task: 1) Define the project assessment and control strategy. NOTE  The strategy identifies the expected Project Assessment and Control activities, including planned assessment methods and timeframes, necessary management and technical reviews. b) Assess the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess alignment of project objectives and plans with the project context. 2) Assess management and technical plans against objectives to determine adequacy and feasibility. 3) Assess project and technical status against appropriate plans to determine actual and projected cost, schedule, and performance variances. 4) Assess the adequacy of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities.  NOTE  This includes assessment of the adequacy of personnel competencies to perform project roles and accomplish project tasks. Objective measures are used wherever possible, e.g., efficiency of resource use, project achievement. 5) Assess the adequacy and availability of resources. NOTE  Resources include infrastructure, personnel, funding, time, or other pertinent items. This includes confirming that intra-organizational commitments are satisfied. 6) Assess progress using measured achievement and milestone completion. NOTE  This includes collecting and evaluating data for labor, material, service costs, and technical performance, as well as other technical data about objectives, such as affordability. These are compared against measures of achievement.  This includes conducting effectiveness assessments to determine the adequacy of the evolving system against requirements.  It also includes the readiness of enabling systems to deliver their services when needed. 7) Conduct required management and technical reviews, audits and inspections. NOTE  These are formal or informal, and are conducted to determine readiness to proceed to the next stage of the life cycle or project milestone, to help ensure that project and technical objectives are being met, or to obtain feedback from stakeholders. 8) Monitor critical processes and new technologies. NOTE  This includes identifying and evaluating technology maturity and insertion. 9) Analyze measurement results and make recommendations. NOTE  Measurement results are analyzed to identify deviations, variations or undesirable trends from planned values that include potential concerns, and to make appropriate recommendations for corrections or preventive actions. This includes, where appropriate, statistical analysis of measures that indicates trends, e.g., fault density to indicate quality of outputs, distribution of measured parameters that indicate process repeatability.  10) Record and provide status and findings from assessment tasks. NOTE  These are generally designated in the agreement, policies and procedures. 11) Monitor process execution within the project.

Any improvement actions identified would be handled through the Quality Assurance process or the Life Cycle Model Management process. c) Control the project.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Initiate necessary actions needed to address identified issues. NOTE 1 This occurs when project or technical achievement is not meeting planned targets. This includes corrective, preventive, and problem resolution actions. Actions generally require replanning or reassignment of personnel, tools and infrastructure assets when inadequacy or unavailability has been detected, or when project or technical achievement exceeds targets or plan.  They often impact the cost, schedule, or technical scope or definition. Actions sometimes require changes to the implementation and execution of the life cycle processes. NOTE 2 Actions are recorded and reviewed to confirm their adequacy and timeliness. 2) Initiate necessary project replanning. NOTE 1 Project replanning is initiated when project objectives or constraints have changed, or when planning assumptions are shown to be invalid. NOTE 2 Any change that requires a change to the agreement between acquirer and supplier invokes the Acquisition and Supply Processes.  3) Initiate change actions when there is a contractual change to cost, time or quality due to the impact of an acquirer or supplier request. NOTE  This includes consideration of modified terms and conditions for supply or initiating new supplier selection, which invokes the Acquisition and Supply Processes. 4) Authorize the project to proceed toward the next milestone or event, if justified. NOTE  The Project Assessment and Control process is used to reach agreement on milestone completion 6.3.3 Decision management process 6.3.3.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Decision Management process is to provide a structured, analytical framework for objectively identifying, characterizing and evaluating a set of alternatives for a decision at any point in the life cycle and select the most beneficial course of action.   NOTE 1 This process is used to resolve technical or project issues and respond to requests for decisions encountered during the system life cycle, in order to identify the alternative(s) that provides the preferred outcomes for the situation. The methods most frequently used for Decision Management are the trade study and engineering analysis. Each of the alternatives is assessed against the decision criteria (e.g., cost impact, schedule impact, programmatic constraints, regulatory implications, technical performance characteristics, critical quality characteristics, and risk). Results of these comparisons are ranked, via a suitable selection model, and are then used to decide on an optimal solution. Key study data, (e.g., assumptions and decision rationale) are typically maintained to inform decision-makers, and support future decision-making.  NOTE 2 When it is necessary to perform a detailed assessment of a parameter for one of the criteria, the System Analysis process is employed to perform the assessment.  6.3.3.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Decision Management process: a) Decisions requiring alternative analysis are identified. b) Alternative courses of action are identified and evaluated. c) A preferred course of action is selected.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a decision management strategy.  NOTE A decision management strategy includes the identification of roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities.  It includes the identification of decision categories and a prioritization scheme. Decisions often arise as a result of an effectiveness assessment, a technical trade-off, a problem needing to be solved, an action needed as a response to risk exceeding the acceptable threshold, or a new opportunity or approval for project progression to the next life cycle stage. Organization or project guidelines determine the degree of rigor and formality to apply to the decision analysis. 2) Identify the circumstances and need for a decision. NOTE Problems or opportunities and the alternative courses of action that will resolve their outcome are recorded, categorized and reported.  3) Involve relevant stakeholders in the decision-making in order to draw on experience and knowledge. NOTE It is good practice to identify the subject matter expertise needed for the analysis and the decision.  b) Analyze the decision information.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Select and declare the decision management strategy for each decision.  NOTE The degree of rigor required to resolve these problems or opportunities is determined, as well as the data and system analysis needed for evaluating the alternatives. 2) Determine desired outcomes and measurable selection criteria. NOTE The desired value for all quantifiable criteria and the threshold value(s) beyond which the attribute will be unsatisfactory are determined, as well as weighting factors for all criteria.  3) Identify the trade space and alternatives. NOTE If a large number of alternatives exist, they are qualitatively screened to reduce alternatives to a manageable number for further detailed systems analysis. This screening is often based on qualitative assessments of such factors as risk, cost, schedule, and regulatory impacts. 4) Evaluate each alternative, against the criteria. NOTE The System Analysis process is used, as necessary, to quantify specific criteria for each trade alternative to be evaluated. This includes new design parameters, different architecture characteristics, and range of values for critical quality characteristics. The System Analysis process assesses the range of parameter variations in order to obtain a sensitivity analysis for each of the trade alternatives evaluated.  These results are used to establish the feasibility of the various trade alternatives.  c) Make and manage decisions.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Determine preferred alternative for each decision. NOTE Alternatives are evaluated quantitatively, using the selection criteria. The selected alternative generally provides an optimization of, or improvement in, an identified decision.  2) Record the resolution, decision rationale, and assumptions. 3) Record, track, evaluate and report decisions.

NOTE 2 This allows the organization to confirm that problems have been effectively resolved, that adverse trends have been reversed, and that advantage has been taken of opportunities. 6.3.4 Risk management process 6.3.4.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Risk Management process is to identify, analyze, treat and monitor the risks continually.   The Risk Management process is a continual process for systematically addressing risk throughout the life cycle of a system product or service. It can be applied to risks related to the acquisition, development, maintenance or operation of a system. NOTE Risk is defined in ISO Guide 73:2009 as ""The effect of uncertainty on objectives"".  This has an attached NOTE 1, ""An effect is a deviation from the expected — positive and/or negative.""  A positive risk is sometimes commonly known as an opportunity, and addressed within the risk management process. 6.3.4.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Risk Management process: a) Risks are identified.  b) Risks are analyzed. c) Risk treatment options are identified, prioritized, and selected. d) Appropriate treatment is implemented. e) Risks are evaluated to assess changes in status and progress in treatment. 6.3.4.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Risk Management process. NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE 16085 provides a more detailed set of risk management activities and tasks. This risk management process is aligned with ISO 31000:2009 Risk management — Principles and Guidelines, and ISO Guide 73:2009, Risk management — Vocabulary. ISO 9001:2008 standard provides risk-based preventive action requirements in subclause 8.5.3. a) Plan risk management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the risk management strategy. NOTE This includes the risk management process of all supply chain suppliers and describes how risks from all suppliers will be raised to the next level(s) for incorporation in the project risk process. 2) Define and record the context of the Risk Management process.  NOTE 1 This includes a description of stakeholders’ perspectives, risk categories, and a description (perhaps by reference) of the technical and managerial objectives, assumptions and constraints. The risk categories include the relevant technical areas of the system and facilitate identification of risks across the life cycle of the system. As noted in ISO 31000 the aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list of risks based on those events that might create, enhance, prevent, degrade, accelerate or delay the achievement of objectives.   NOTE 2 Opportunities, which are one type of risk, provide potential benefits for the system or project.  Each of the opportunities pursued have associated risks that detract from the expected benefit.  This includes the risks associated with not pursuing an opportunity, as well as the risk of not achieving the effects of the opportunity.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define and record the risk thresholds and conditions under which a level of risk may be accepted.  2) Establish and maintain a risk profile.  NOTE The risk profile records: the risk management context; a record of each risk’s state including its likelihood of occurrence, consequences, and risk thresholds; the priority of each risk based on risk criteria supplied by the stakeholders; and the risk action requests along with the status of their treatment. The risk profile is updated when there are changes in an individual risk’s state. The priority in the risk profile is used to determine the application of resources for treatment. 3) Periodically provide the relevant risk profile to stakeholders based upon their needs.  c) Analyze risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify risks in the categories described in the risk management context.  NOTE Risks are commonly identified through various analyses, such as safety, reliability, producibility, and performance analyses; technology, architecture, and readiness assessments; and trade studies. These risks may be identified early in the life cycle and continue into the utilization, support, and retirement of the system. Additionally, risks are often identified through the analysis of the measures of the system. 2) Estimate the likelihood of occurrence and consequences of each identified risk.   3) Evaluate each risk against its risk thresholds.  4) For each risk that does not meet its risk threshold, define and record recommended treatment strategies and measures. NOTE Risk treatment strategies include, but are not limited to, eliminating the risk, reducing its likelihood of occurrence or severity of consequence, or accepting the risk. Treatments also include taking or increasing risk in order to pursue an opportunity. Measures provide information about the effectiveness of the treatment alternatives. d) Treat risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify recommended alternatives for risk treatment.  2) Implement risk treatment alternatives for which the stakeholders determine that actions should be taken to make a risk acceptable.  3) When the stakeholders accept a risk that does not meet its threshold, consider it a high priority and monitor it continually to determine if any future risk treatment actions are necessary.  4) Once a risk treatment is selected, coordinate management action.  NOTE Refer to Project Assessment and Control process. e) Monitor risks.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Continually monitor all risks and the risk management context for changes and evaluate the risks when their state has changed.  2) Implement and monitor measures to evaluate the effectiveness of risk treatments.  3) Continually monitor for the emergence of new risks and sources throughout the life cycle.  6.3.5 Configuration management process 6.3.5.1 Purpose  The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to manage and control system elements and configurations over the life cycle. CM also manages consistency between a product and its associated configuration definition. Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  40  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved 6.3.5.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Configuration Management process: a) Items requiring configuration management are identified and managed. b) Configuration baselines are established. c) Changes to items under configuration management are controlled. d) Configuration status information is available. e) Required configuration audits are completed. f) System releases and deliveries are controlled and approved. 6.3.5.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Configuration Management process. a) Plan configuration management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a configuration management strategy. NOTE 1 This includes details covering: i) Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. ii) Disposition of, access to, release of and control of changes to configuration items. iii) The necessary baselines to be established.  iv) The locations and conditions of storage, the storage media and their environment, in accordance with designated levels of integrity, security and safety. v) The criteria or events for commencing configuration control and maintaining baselines of evolving configurations.  vi) The audit strategy and the responsibilities for assessing continual integrity and security of the configuration definition information. vii) Change management, including any planned configuration control boards, regular and emergency change requests; and procedures for change management. NOTE 2 The configuration management strategy needs to identify how configuration management will be coordinated across the set of acquirer, supplier, and supply chain organizations.  The strategy covers the life of the system, or the extent of the contract, as appropriate.  NOTE 3 Additional guidance regarding configuration management activities can be found in ISO 10007, IEEE Std 828, and ANSI EIA-649-B. Also, domain specific practices, such as SAE ARP4754A, Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems, provide additional application detail for the domain. 2) Define the archive and retrieval approach for configuration items, configuration management artifacts and data.  NOTE This includes data retention procedures.   b) Perform configuration identification. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the system elements and information items that are configuration items. Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  41 NOTE Configuration items receive special attention. They are usually assigned unique identifiers and are often the subject of reviews and configuration audits. Items subject to configuration control usually include requirements, product and system elements, information items, and baselines. 2) Identify the hierarchy and structure of system information. NOTE This includes product or system element hierarchy, system decomposition, etc. 3) Establish system, system element, and information item identifiers. NOTE Items are distinguished by unique, durable identifiers or markings, where appropriate. The identifiers are in accordance with relevant standards and product sector conventions, such that the items under configuration control are unambiguously traceable to their specifications or equivalent, recorded descriptions. 4) Define baselines through the life cycle. NOTE Baselines capture the evolving configuration states of system elements at designated times or under defined circumstances.  The content for the baselines is developed through the technical processes, but is formalized at a point in time through the CM process. Baselines form the basis for the next change. Selected baselines typically become formalized between acquirer and supplier, depending on the practices of the industry and the contractual involvement of the acquirer in the configuration management process.  There are generally three major types of baselines at the system level; functional baseline, allocated baseline, and product baseline.  These vary by domain or local strategy.   5) Obtain acquirer and supplier agreement to establish a baseline. NOTE The Project Assessment & Control process is used to reach agreement. c) Perform configuration change management. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Configuration change management establishes procedures and methods for managing change to a baseline once it is established.  This is sometimes referred to as configuration control. 1) Identify and record Requests for Change and Requests for Variance. NOTE A request for variance is sometimes referred to as a deviation, waiver, or concession. 2) Coordinate, evaluate, and disposition Requests for Change and Requests for Variance. NOTE This includes an impact assessment of proposed changes, including impact on project plans, costs, benefits, risks, quality, and schedule.  A decision is made on whether to implement or close the change request. 3) Submit requests for review and approval. NOTE Requests for Change and Requests for Variance are often under the formal control of a Configuration Control Board (CCB).  Evaluation includes analysis of need versus impact. 4) Track and manage approved changes to the baseline, Requests for Change, and Requests for Variance. NOTE 1 This task involves prioritization, tracking, scheduling, and closing changes.  Changes are then made through the Technical Processes.  These changes are verified or validated through the Verification and Validation Processes, to help ensure that the approved changes have been made. NOTE 2 Any changes and rationales are generally recorded. d) Perform configuration status accounting. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Develop and maintain the configuration management status information, for system elements, baselines, and releases. NOTE 1 Configuration status accounting provides the data on the status of controlled products needed to make decisions regarding system elements throughout the product life cycle.  This includes taking into account the nature of the items under configuration control. Configuration descriptions conform, where possible, to product or technology standards.  Configuration information permits forward and backward traceability to other configuration states.  The rationale for the baselines and releases and associated authorizations in configuration data are generally recorded.

NOTE 2 The recording, retrieval and consolidation of the current configuration status and the status of all preceding configurations to confirm information correctness, timeliness, integrity and security is managed. Audits are performed to verify conformance of a baseline to drawings, interface control documents and other agreement requirements. 2) Capture, store and report configuration management data. e) Perform configuration evaluation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the need for CM audits and schedule the events. 2) Verify the product configuration meets the configuration requirements. NOTE This is performed by comparing requirements, constraints, and waivers (variances) with results of formal verification activities. 3) Monitor the incorporation of  approved configuration changes. 4) Assess whether the system meets baseline functional and performance capabilities. NOTE This is sometimes called a functional configuration audit (FCA). 5) Assess whether the system conforms to the operational and configuration information items. NOTE This is sometimes called a physical configuration audit (PCA). 6) Record the CM audit results and disposition action items. f) Perform release control. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Approve system releases and deliveries.  NOTE 1 The purpose of a release is to authorize the use of a system for a specific purpose, with or without restrictions. Examples are releases for tests or for operational use.  NOTE 2 Releases generally include a set of changes. These changes are made through the Technical Processes, and then verified or validated through the Verification and Validation Processes. Approval of a release generally includes acceptance of the verified and validated changes. 2) Track and manage system releases and deliveries. NOTE Where appropriate, master copies of all system elements are generally maintained for the life of the system. The system elements are handled, stored, packaged, and delivered in accordance with the policies of the organizations involved. 6.3.6 Information management process 6.3.6.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Information Management process is to generate, obtain, confirm, transform, retain, retrieve, disseminate and dispose of information, to designated stakeholders. Information management plans, executes, and controls the provision of information to designated stakeholders that is unambiguous, complete, verifiable, consistent, modifiable, traceable, and presentable. Information includes technical, project, organizational, agreement, and user information. Information is often derived from data records of the organization, system, process, or project. 6.3.6.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Information Management process: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  43 a) Information to be managed is identified. b) Information representations are defined. c) Information is obtained, developed, transformed, stored, validated, presented, and disposed of. d) The status of information is identified. e) Information is available to designated stakeholders. 6.3.6.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Information Management process. NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 summarizes requirements for the content of life cycle process information items (documentation) and provides guidance on their development. a) Prepare for information management.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the strategy for information management.  NOTE Information about the same topic can be developed in different ways at different points in the life cycle and for different audiences. 2) Define the items of information that will be managed.  NOTE This includes the information that will be managed during the system life cycle and possibly maintained for a defined period beyond.  This is done according to organizational policy, agreements, or legislation. 3) Designate authorities and responsibilities for information management. NOTE Due regard is paid to information and data legislation, security and privacy, e.g., ownership, agreement restrictions, rights of access, intellectual property and patents. Where restrictions or constraints apply, information is identified accordingly. Staff having knowledge of such items of information are informed of their obligations and responsibilities. 4) Define the content, formats and structure of information items. NOTE The information originates and terminates in many forms (e.g., audiovisual, textual, graphical, numerical) and mediums (e.g., electronic, printed, magnetic, optical).  Organization constraints, e.g., infrastructure, inter-organizational communications, and distributed project workings, are taken into account.  Relevant information item standards and conventions are used according to policy, agreements and legislation constraints. 5) Define information maintenance actions. NOTE Information maintenance includes status reviews of stored information for integrity, validity and availability.  It also includes any needs for replication or transformation to an alternative medium, as necessary, either to retain infrastructure as technology changes so that archived media can be read or to migrate archived media to newer technology. b) Perform information management.   This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain, develop, or transform the identified items of information. NOTE This includes collecting the data, information, or information items from appropriate sources (e.g., resulting from any life cycle process), and writing, illustrating, or transforming it into useable information for stakeholders. It includes reviewing, validating, and editing information per information standards. 2) Maintain information items and their storage records, and record the status of information. NOTE 1 Information items are maintained according to their integrity, security and privacy requirements.

NOTE This includes the capture of lessons learned and the conduct of surveillance reviews of process implementation through the supply chain. e) Treat incidents and problems. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE 1 In the terminology of quality management, problems are often described as “non-conformities” which, if left untreated, could cause the project to fail to meet its requirements. NOTE 2 For additional information and examples of problem categories and priority classifications, see ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011), Annex C. 1) Incidents are recorded, analyzed and classified. 2) Incidents are resolved or elevated to problems. 3) Problems are recorded, analyzed and classified. NOTE Analysis results include potential treatment options. 4) Treatments for problems are prioritized and implementation is tracked. NOTE Implementation is done in the Technical Processes after initiation by the Project Assessment and Control Process. 5) Trends in incidents and problems are noted and analyzed. 6) Stakeholders are informed of the status of incidents and problems. 7) Incidents and problems are tracked to closure. 6.4 Technical processes The Technical Processes are used to define the requirements for a system, to transform the requirements into an effective product, to permit consistent reproduction of the product where necessary, to use the product to provide the required services, to sustain the provision of those services and to dispose of the product when it is retired from service. The Technical Processes define the activities that enable organization and project functions to optimize the benefits and reduce the risks that arise from technical decisions and actions.  These activities enable products and services to possess the timeliness and availability, the cost effectiveness, and the functionality, reliability, maintainability, producibility, usability and other qualities required by acquiring and supplying organizations.  They also enable products and services to conform to the expectations or legislated requirements of society, including health, safety, security and environmental factors. The Technical Processes consist of the following: a) Business or Mission Analysis process; b) Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process; c) System Requirements Definition process; d) Architecture Definition process; e) Design Definition process; f) System Analysis process; g) Implementation process; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  48  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved h) Integration process; i) Verification process; j) Transition process; k) Validation process; l) Operation process; m) Maintenance process; n) Disposal process. NOTE 1 For software and hardware system elements, these processes are applied at recursively lower levels for system definition and recursively higher levels for system realization for stakeholder needs and requirements definition, system requirements definition, architecture definition, design definition, system analysis, integration, verification and validation. NOTE 2 These processes are often performed concurrently, iterating between one another to establish a solution that is balanced with respect to requirements, critical performance measures, and critical quality characteristics. At any level of abstraction, system requirements and models are made consistent via iterations of applicable technical processes. When requirements and models are not directly capable of being implemented, the same processes are repeated recursively at a more detailed level, e.g., the next lower level of the system hierarchy. NOTE 3 The concept of life cycle stages and the application of these processes in any stage are described in detail in ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 (IEEE Std 24748-1-2011).  It has a complete set of example stages and stage outcomes for the enactment of technical processes within a system life cycle.  NOTE 4 Interface Management is a set of activities that cut across the systems engineering processes. These are cross-cutting activities of the Technical and Technical Management processes that apply and track as a specific view of the processes and system. See Annex E of this standard for an example Interface Management Process View and the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook, Version 4, section 9.6 for more information. 6.4.1 Business or mission analysis process 6.4.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Business or Mission Analysis process is to define the business or mission problem or opportunity, characterize the solution space, and determine potential solution class(es) that could address a problem or take advantage of an opportunity. NOTE 1 Business and Mission Analysis is related to the organization encompassing all stakeholders concerned by the activities of the system life cycle. This process interacts with the organization's strategy, which is generally outside the scope of 15288. The results of the organization's strategic analysis include the organizational Concept of Operations, strategic goals and plans, new market or mission elements, and identified problems and opportunities. The organization's strategy establishes the context within which the business or mission analysis is performed.  The organizational Concept of Operations relates to the leadership's intended way of operating the organization. It describes the organization’s assumptions and how it intends to use the system to be developed, existing systems, and possible future systems in support of an overall operation or series of operations of the business. In the case that the organization is the system-of-interest, the organization’s strategy is part of the system definition. NOTE 2 This process has application through the life of the system solution and is revisited if there are changes in the environment, needs, or other drivers. NOTE 3 In some domains, this relates to the concept of identifying and analyzing capabilities that are needed or desired by the organization.  This process focuses on the necessary capabilities and interacts with the Portfolio Management process for identifying the trade space that can address the capability.  The identified problems or opportunities are often translated into target capabilities.  As applicable within a given domain, the problem or opportunity space includes the target capabilities. 6.4.1.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Business or Mission Analysis process: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  49 a) The problem or opportunity space is defined. b) The solution space is characterized.  c) Preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in the life cycle stages are defined. d) Candidate alternative solution classes are identified and analyzed.  e) The preferred candidate alternative solution class(es) are selected. f) Any enabling systems or services needed for business or mission analysis are available. g) Traceability of business or mission problems and opportunities and the preferred alternative solution classes is established. 6.4.1.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Business or Mission Analysis process. a) Prepare for business or mission analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review identified problems and opportunities in the organization strategy with respect to desired organization goals or objectives. NOTE This includes problems or opportunities with respect to the organization business or mission, vision, Concept of Operations, and other organization strategic goals and objectives.  This includes identified deficiencies or gaps in existing capabilities, systems, products, or services. 2) Define the business or mission analysis strategy.  NOTE This includes the approach to be used to identify and define the problem space, characterize the solution space and select a solution class. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support business or mission analysis. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for enabling systems. Enabling systems for business or mission analysis include the business systems and repositories of the organization. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define the problem or opportunity space. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Analyze the problems and opportunities in the context of relevant trade-space factors. NOTE 1 This analysis is focused on understanding the scope, basis, or drivers of the problems or opportunities, as opposed to the synthesis that is the focus of system analysis and decision management needed for trade studies.  The focus here includes changes in mission requirements, business opportunities, capabilities, performance improvement, or lack of existing systems, security and safety improvement, factors such as cost and effectiveness, regulation changes, user dissatisfaction, and PESTEL factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal). This may be accomplished through external, internal, or SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis.   NOTE 2 The outputs of the analysis are considered as part of the portfolio management decisions. 2) Define the mission, business, or operational problem or opportunity. NOTE This definition includes the context and any key parameters, without regard to a specific solution, since the solution could be an operational change, a change to an existing product or service, or a new system.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in life cycle stages. NOTE 1 This involves the identification of major stakeholder groups such as customers, users, administrations, regulators, and system owners. that are defined in the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. NOTE 2 Preliminary life cycle concepts include preliminary acquisition concepts, preliminary deployment concepts, preliminary operational concepts, preliminary support concepts, and preliminary retirement concepts.  Operational concepts include high level operational modes or states, operational scenarios, potential use cases, or usage within a proposed business strategy. These concepts enable feasibility analysis and evaluation of alternatives. These concepts are further refined within the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process.  NOTE 3 The operating environment may be known to have vulnerabilities associated with specific security threats and safety hazards.  These vulnerabilities need to be understood in association with the product under development. The system and human interfaces are an element of the system assurance context and related vulnerabilities are examined in the context of mission critical threads. 2) Identify candidate alternative solution classes that span the potential solution space. NOTE These may range from simple operational changes to various system developments or modifications. The solution space can include the identification of existing systems, products, and services that can address the need for operational or functional modifications. This includes deducing what potential expected services will be needed. The solution space characterization often invokes the Architecture Definition process for a user architecture viewpoint resulting in architecture views (e.g., capability views, program views and operational views) as proposed by ISO/IEC 42010. d) Evaluate alternative solution classes. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess each alternative solution class. NOTE 1 Each alternative solution class is assessed against defined criteria that are established based on the organization's strategy. Feasibility of the solution class is one key decision criteria. The Portfolio Management process provides some criteria to be considered.  NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess the value of each criterion for each alternative solution class.  Structured affordability trade-offs are recommended. Including cost as a criterion will aid affordability decisions.  The assessment of alternatives can include modeling, simulation, analytical techniques, or expert judgment to understand the risks, feasibility and value of the alternative candidate solution classes. 2) Select the preferred alternative solution class(es). NOTE The Decision Management process is used to evaluate alternatives and to guide selection. Selected alternatives are validated in the context of the organization's strategy. Feedback on risks, feasibility, market factors, and alternatives is provided for use in updating the organization's strategy. e) Manage the business or mission analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Maintain traceability of business or mission analysis. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the business and mission problems and opportunities and the preferred alternative solution classes with the organizational strategy, stakeholder needs and requirements, and system analysis results supporting decisions. 2) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Business or Mission Analysis) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM.

It identifies stakeholders, or stakeholder classes, involved with the system throughout its life cycle, and their needs. It analyzes and transforms these needs into a common set of stakeholder requirements that express the intended interaction the system will have with its operational environment and that are the reference against which each resulting operational capability is validated. The stakeholder requirements are defined considering the context of the system-of-interest with the interoperating systems and enabling systems. 6.4.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process: a) Stakeholders of the system are identified. b) Required characteristics and context of use of capabilities and concepts in the life cycle stages, including operational concepts, are defined. c) Constraints on a system are identified. d) Stakeholder needs are defined. e) Stakeholder needs are prioritized and transformed into clearly defined stakeholder requirements. f) Critical performance measures are defined. g) Stakeholder agreement that their needs and expectations are reflected adequately in the requirements is achieved. h) Any enabling systems or services needed for stakeholder needs and requirements are available. i) Traceability of stakeholder requirements to stakeholders and their needs is established. 6.4.2.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. a) Prepare for stakeholder needs and requirements definition. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the system throughout its life cycle. NOTE This includes individuals and classes of stakeholders who are users, operators, supporters, developers, producers, trainers, maintainers, disposers, acquirer and supplier organizations, parties responsible for external interfacing entities, regulatory bodies and others who have a legitimate interest in the system.  Where direct communication is not practicable (e.g., for consumer products and services), representatives or designated proxy stakeholders are selected. 2) Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy.  NOTE Some stakeholders have interests that oppose the system or oppose each other.  When the stakeholder interests oppose each other, but do not oppose the system, this process is intended to gain consensus among the stakeholder classes to establish a common set of acceptable requirements. The intent or desires of those that oppose the system, or detractors of the system, are addressed through the Risk Management process, threat analyses of the System Analysis process, or the system requirements for security, adaptability, or resilience.  In this case, the stakeholder needs are not satisfied, but rather addressed in a manner to help ensure system assurance and integrity if actions from the detractors are encountered.

NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for stakeholder needs and requirements definition include tools for facilitation and requirements management. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define stakeholder needs. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts. NOTE Context of use is often captured using a Context of Use Description [ISO/IEC 25063.3]. Preliminary life cycle concepts are developed by the Business or Mission Analysis process.  2) Identify stakeholder needs. NOTE 1 Identification of stakeholder needs includes elicitation of needs directly from the stakeholder, identification of implicit stakeholder needs based on domain knowledge and context understanding, and documented gaps from previous activities. Needs often include measures of effectiveness.  Functional analysis is often used to aid the elicitation of needs. Also quality characteristics of the quality model in ISO/IEC 25010 and quality model application to requirements analysis in ISO/IEC 25030 are useful to elicit and identify quality requirements of non-functional requirements, which are often implicit stakeholder needs. NOTE 2 Stakeholder needs describe the needs, wants, desires, expectations and perceived constraints of identified stakeholders. Understanding stakeholder needs for the minimum security and privacy requirements necessary for the operational environment minimizes the  potential for disruption in plans, schedules, and performance. If significant issues are likely to arise relating to users and other stakeholders and their involvement in or interaction with a system, recommendations for identifying and treating human-system issues can be found in ISO TS 18152. 3) Prioritize and down-select needs. NOTE The Decision Management process is typically used to support prioritization.  The System Analysis process is used to analyze needs for feasibility or other factors. 4) Define the stakeholder needs and rationale. NOTE Needs concentrate on system purpose and behavior, and are described in the context of the operational environment and conditions.  It is useful to trace needs to their sources and rationale.  c) Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Other life cycle concepts can include acquisition concepts, deployment concepts, support concepts, security concepts, and retirement concepts.  In this activity, the preliminary life cycle concepts defined within the Business or Mission Analysis process are further developed in the context of specific stakeholder needs, as associated scenarios and interactions are defined.  See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on operational concepts, and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 Annex A for an annotated outline for a System Operational Concept. 1) Define a representative set of scenarios to identify all required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts. NOTE 1 Scenarios are used to analyze the operation of the system in its intended environment in order to identify additional needs or requirements that possibly have not been explicitly identified by any of the stakeholders, e.g., legal, regulatory and social obligations.  The context of use of the system is identified and analyzed, including the activities that users perform to achieve system objectives, the relevant characteristics of the end users of the system (e.g., expected training, degree of fatigue), the physical environment (e.g., available light, temperature) and any equipment to be used (e.g., protective or communication equipment). The social and organizational influences on users that could affect system use or constrain its design are analyzed when applicable. Scenarios centered on attackers, their environments, tools, techniques, and capabilities are key considerations for operational concept development. Scenarios are prioritized in order to reflect the weighted importance of the various operational needs.

Abuse and failure scenarios highlight the need for additional functional requirements (or more specific derived requirements) to mitigate risks that are identified in the abuse or failure scenarios. 2) Identify the interaction between users and the system. NOTE 1 Usability requirements take into account human capabilities and skills limitations. Where possible, applicable standards, e.g., ISO 9241, and accepted professional practices are used in order to define: i) Physical, mental, and learned capabilities. ii) Work place, environment and facilities, including other equipment in the context of use. iii) Normal, unusual, and emergency conditions. iv) Operator and user recruitment, training and culture. NOTE 2 If usability is important, usability requirements are planned, specified, and implemented through the life cycle processes. Refer to ISO TS 18152 for information on human-system issues and ISO/IEC 25060:2010 for information on usability.  d) Transform stakeholder needs into stakeholder requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the constraints on a system solution.  NOTE These result from 1) instances or areas of stakeholder-defined solution; 2) implementation decisions made at higher levels of system hierarchical structure; 3) required use of defined enabling, legacy, or interfacing systems or system elements, resources and staff; or 4) stakeholder defined affordability objectives. Include those that are unavoidable consequences of existing agreements, management decisions and technical decisions. 2) Identify the stakeholder requirements and functions that relate to critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, environment, or health. NOTE 1 See ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 for additional information on system and software assurance. NOTE 2 Identifying safety risks facilitates the identification of safety requirements and functions. Safety risks include those associated with methods of operations and support, health and safety, threats to property and environmental influences.  Use applicable standards, e.g., IEC 61508, and accepted professional practices.  NOTE 3 Identifying security risks facilitates the identification of additional security requirements and functions. If warranted, include applicable areas of system security, including physical, procedural, communications, computers, programs, data and emissions.  This includes access and damage to protected personnel, properties and information, compromise of sensitive information, and denial of approved access to property and information.  This also includes the required security functions, such as mitigation and containment, referencing applicable standards and accepted professional practices where mandatory or relevant. NOTE 4 See ISO/IEC 25030 for further information regarding quality characteristics from a quality in use perspective. 3) Define stakeholder requirements, consistent with life cycle concepts, scenarios, interactions, constraints, and critical quality characteristics. NOTE 1 See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on stakeholder requirements, and clauses 8 and 9 for a description of and an annotated outline for a Stakeholder Requirements Specification. NOTE 2 The stakeholder requirements are reviewed at key decision times in the life cycle to help ensure that account is taken of any changes of need. NOTE 3 The stakeholder requirements are recorded in a form suitable for requirements management through the life cycle. These records establish the stakeholder requirements baseline, and retain changes of need and their origin throughout the system life cycle. These records are the basis for traceability to decisions made by the Business or Mission Analysis process as well as stakeholder needs, system requirements, and subsequent system elements. NOTE 4  The stakeholder requirements are the basis of the validation criteria for the system and system elements.   e) Analyze stakeholder requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  54  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved 1) Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements. NOTE 1 Stakeholder requirements are analyzed for characteristics of individual requirements, as well as characteristics of the set of requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements are necessary, implementation free, unambiguous, consistent, complete, singular, feasible, traceable, verifiable, affordable, and bounded. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 provides additional information on characteristics of requirements. NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess feasibility and affordability. The Verification and Validation processes are used in the review of stakeholder requirements. 2) Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement. NOTE This includes defining technical and quality measures and critical performance parameters associated with each effectiveness measure identified in the stakeholder requirements. The critical performance measures (e.g., measures of effectiveness and measures of suitability) are defined, analyzed and reviewed to help ensure stakeholder requirements are met and to help ensure identification of project cost, schedule or performance risk associated with any non-compliance. ISO/IEC 15939 (IEEE Std 15939-2007) provides a process to identify, define and use appropriate measures. INCOSE TP-2003-020-01, Technical Measurement, provides information on the selection, definition and implementation of critical performance measures. The ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards provides relevant quality measures. 3) Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed. 4) Resolve stakeholder requirements issues. NOTE This includes requirements that violate the characteristics for individual requirements or the set of requirements as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. f) Manage the stakeholder needs and requirements definition.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain explicit agreement on the stakeholder requirements. NOTE This includes confirming that stakeholder requirements are expressed correctly, comprehensible to originators, and that the resolution of conflict in the requirements has not corrupted or compromised stakeholder intentions. 2) Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.  NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the stakeholder needs and requirements and the stakeholders and sources, organizational strategy, and business and mission problems and opportunities. Additional traceability to systems making up the system solution facilitates the transition to the System Requirements Definition process. This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 3) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the stakeholder needs, stakeholder requirements, and operational concept are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.3  System requirements definition process 6.4.3.1 Purpose  The purpose of the System Requirements Definition process is to transform the stakeholder, user-oriented view of desired capabilities into a technical view of a solution that meets the operational needs of the user.   This process creates a set of measurable system requirements that specify, from the supplier’s perspective, what characteristics, attributes, and functional and performance requirements the system is to possess, in order to satisfy stakeholder requirements. As far as constraints permit, the requirements should not imply any specific implementation.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the functional boundary of the system in terms of the behavior and properties to be provided. NOTE The functional boundary definition is partly based on the context of use and operational scenarios defined in the frame of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. This includes the system’s stimuli and its responses to user and environment behavior, and an analysis and description of the required interactions between the system and its environment in terms of interface properties and constraints, such as mechanical, electrical, mass, thermal, data, and procedural flows.  This establishes the expected system behavior, expressed in quantitative terms, at its boundary. 2) Define the system requirements definition strategy.  NOTE This includes the approach to be used to identify and define the system requirements, and manage the requirements through the life cycle. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support system requirements definition. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for system requirements definition include tools for facilitation and requirements management. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Define system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define each function that the system is required to perform. NOTE 1 This includes how well the system, including its operators, is required to perform that function, the conditions under which the system is to be capable of performing the function, the conditions under which the system is to commence performing that function and the conditions under which the system is to cease performing that function. In some cases, functions are derived from analysis of critical quality characteristics (e.g., system diagnosing function or highly frequent data backup function for reliability). NOTE 2 Conditions for the performance of functions can incorporate reference to required states and modes of operation of the system.  System requirements depend heavily on abstract representations of proposed system characteristics and sometimes employ multiple modeling techniques and perspectives to give a sufficiently complete description of the desired system requirements.  Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  56  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved NOTE 3 Enabling functions that are required to support the system-of-interest in achieving its functionality are also identified and defined concurrently with the function of the system-of-interest. This is necessary to help ensure that the enabling functions are identified and accounted for. 2) Define necessary implementation constraints. NOTE This includes the implementation decisions that are allocated from architecture definition at higher levels in the structure of the system and are introduced by stakeholder requirements or are solution limitations.  3) Identify system requirements that relate to risks, criticality of the system, or critical quality characteristics. NOTE Critical quality characteristics commonly include those related to health, safety, security assurance, reliability, availability and supportability. This includes analysis and definition of safety considerations, including those relating to methods of operation and maintenance, environmental influences and personnel injury.  It also includes helping to ensure each safety related function and its associated safety integrity, is expressed in terms of the necessary risk reduction, and is specified and allocated to designated safety-related systems.  Applicable standards are used concerning functional safety, e.g., IEC 61508, and environmental protection, e.g., ISO 14001. Analyze security considerations including those related to compromise and protection of sensitive information, data and material.  The security-related risks are defined, including, but not limited to, administrative, personnel, physical, computer, communication, network, emission and environment factors using, as appropriate, applicable security standards. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026-4 for system and software assurance guidance. ISO/IEC 27036 provides guidance for information security requirements for the outsourcing of products and services. ISO 25030 provides guidance for external system quality factors and characteristics. For systems intended for human interaction, human-factors engineering (ergonomics) specifications are considered. For systems that have usability requirements, recommendations for obtaining a desired level of usability can be found in ISO TR 18529, Ergonomics—Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Human-centred life cycle process descriptions. 4) Define system requirements and rationale. NOTE 1 This includes defining system requirements consistent with stakeholder requirements, functional boundaries, functions, constraints, cost targets, identified interfaces, and critical quality characteristics. Consistent practice has shown this process requires iterative and recursive steps in parallel with other life cycle processes through the system hierarchy.  See ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clauses 5 and 6 for more information on system requirements, and clauses 8 and 9 for a description of and an annotated outline for a System Requirements Specification. NOTE 2 The system requirements are recorded in a form suitable for requirements management through the life cycle. These records establish the system requirements baseline, and include the associated rationale, decisions and assumptions.  They are the basis for traceability to information items and subsequent system elements. Change requests of system requirements also provide rationale to help in the determination of the acceptability of the proposed change, including consistency with stakeholder requirements.  NOTE 3 The System Analysis Process is used to determine appropriate values for requirement parameters, considering the estimated cost, schedule, and technical performance of the system.  The Validation Process is used to determine if the requirements address the stakeholders’ needs.  The Verification Process determines the quality of the requirements with respect to the attributes and characteristics of good requirements (refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148).   c) Analyze system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Analyze the complete set of system requirements. NOTE 1 System requirements are analyzed for characteristics of individual requirements, as well as characteristics of the set of requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements are necessary, implementation free, unambiguous, consistent, complete, singular, feasible, traceable, verifiable, affordable, and bounded.  ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 provides additional information on characteristics of requirements. Deficiencies, conflicts and weaknesses are identified and resolved within the complete set of system requirements. NOTE 2 The System Analysis process is used to assess feasibility, affordability, and balance.  2) Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement. NOTE This includes defining technical and quality measures and critical performance parameters associated with each effectiveness measure identified in the system requirements. The critical performance measures (e.g., measures of performance and technical performance measures) are analyzed and reviewed to help ensure system requirements Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  57 are met and to help ensure identification of project cost, schedule or performance risk associated with any non-compliance. ISO/IEC 15939 (IEEE Std 15939-2007) provides a process to identify, define and use appropriate measures. INCOSE TP-2003-020-01, Technical Measurement, provides information on the selection, definition and implementation of critical performance measures. The ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards provides relevant quality measures. 3) Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders for review. NOTE Feedback helps ensure that the specified system requirements have been adequately captured and expressed. Confirmation is made that they are a necessary and sufficient response to stakeholder requirements and a necessary and sufficient input to other processes, in particular architecture and design. This is one application of the Validation Process applied for the specific requirements. 4) Resolve system requirements issues. NOTE This includes requirements that violate the characteristics for individual requirements or the set of requirements as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. d) Manage system requirements. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE Maintaining system requirements includes defining, recording, and controlling the baseline, generally under formal configuration management, along with managing any changes resulting from the application of other life cycle processes such as architecture or design. 1) Obtain explicit agreement on the system requirements. NOTE This includes confirming that system requirements are expressed correctly, comprehensible to originators, and that the resolution of conflict in the requirements has not corrupted or compromised stakeholder intentions. 2) Maintain traceability of the system requirements. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the system requirements and the stakeholder requirements, architecture elements, interface definitions, analysis results, verification methods or techniques, and allocated, decomposed, and derived requirements.  This helps ensure that all achievable stakeholder requirements are met by one or more system requirements, and all system requirements meet or contribute to meeting at least one stakeholder requirement.  This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 3) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (System Requirements Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the system requirements are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.4 Architecture definition process  6.4.4.1 Purpose The purpose of the Architecture Definition process is to generate system architecture alternatives, to select one or more alternative(s) that frame stakeholder concerns and meet system requirements, and to express this in a set of consistent views.  Iteration of the Architecture Definition process with the Business or Mission Analysis process, System Requirements Definition process, Design Definition process, and Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process is often employed so that there is a negotiated understanding of the problem to be solved and a satisfactory solution is  identified. The results of the Architecture Definition process are widely used across the life cycle processes. Architecture definition may be applied at many levels of abstraction, highlighting the relevant detail that is necessary for the decisions at that level. NOTE 1 System architecture deals with fundamental principles, concepts, properties, and characteristics and their incorporation into the system-of-interest. Architecture definition has more uses than as merely a driver (or part of) design.  Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 for more information about architecture description and the uses and nature of architecture. NOTE 2 The Architecture Definition process supports identification of stakeholders and their concerns. As the process unfolds, insights are gained into the relation between the requirements specified for the system and the emergent Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  58  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved properties and behaviors of the system that arise from the interactions and relations between the system elements. The Design Definition process (see subclause 6.4.5), on the other hand, is driven by requirements that have been vetted through the architecture and more detailed analyses of feasibility. Architecture focuses on suitability, viability, and desirability, whereas design focuses on compatibility with technologies and other design elements and feasibility of construction and integration. An effective architecture is as design-agnostic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility in the design trade space. An effective architecture also highlights and supports trade-offs for the Design Definition process and possibly other processes such as Portfolio Management, Project Planning, System Requirements Definition, and Verification. NOTE 3 In product line architectures, the architecture is necessarily spanning across several designs. The architecture serves to make the product line cohesive and helps ensure compatibility and interoperability across the product line. Even for a single product system, the design of the product will likely change over time while the architecture remains constant.  6.4.4.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Architecture Definition process: a) Identified stakeholder concerns are addressed by the architecture. b) Architecture viewpoints are developed. c) Context, boundaries, and external interfaces of the system are defined. d) Architecture views and models of the system are developed. e) Concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the system are allocated to architectural entities. f) System elements and their interfaces are identified. g) Architecture candidates are assessed. h) An architectural basis for processes throughout the life cycle is achieved. i) Alignment of the architecture with requirements and design characteristics is achieved. j) Any enabling systems or services needed for architecture definition are available. k) Traceability of architecture elements to stakeholder and system requirements is developed. 6.4.4.3 Activities and tasks  The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Architecture Definition process. a) Prepare for architecture definition. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review pertinent information and identify key drivers of the architecture. NOTE Key drivers are identified by reviewing: (a) market studies, industry projections, competitor product plans, and scientific findings; (b) organizational strategies, organizational-level concept of operations, organizational policies and directives, regulatory and legal constraints, and stakeholder requirements; (c) mission or business concept of operations, system operational concept, operational environment, technology roadmaps, and system requirements; and (d) any other factors that impact the suitability of the system through its life cycle. 2) Identify stakeholder concerns. NOTE Stakeholders are initially identified in the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements process.  Additional stakeholders are usually identified during the Architecture Definition process. Stakeholder concerns related to architecture are expectations or constraints associated with the system life cycle stages such as utilization (e.g., availability, security, effectiveness, usability), support (e.g., reparability, obsolescence management), evolutionary development of the system and of the environment (e.g., adaptability, scalability, survivability), production (e.g., producibility, testability), retirement (e.g., environmental impact, transportability), etc.  This also includes concerns Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  59 that the system will be compromised intentionally or unintentionally via a threat agent or accidentally via a safety hazard. 3) Define the architecture definition roadmap, approach, and strategy. NOTE This includes the identification of stakeholder engagement opportunities, the definition of architecture review activities, evaluation approach and criteria, measurement approach, and measurement methods (refer to the Measurement process). The roadmap shows how the architecture will evolve to an envisioned end state and often has a longer timeframe than for the current system-of-interest. The approach is the manner in which the work will be accomplished, such as how to engage with stakeholders, how to vet the results, or where to do the work. The strategy deals with the systematic plan of action for implementing the approach consistent with the roadmap. 4) Define evaluation criteria based on stakeholder concerns and key requirements. 5) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support the Architecture Definition process. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling system. Enabling systems for architecture definition include tools for collaboration and architecture development, and architecture reuse repositories (for architecture patterns, architecture artifacts, reference architectures, etc.). 6) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Develop architecture viewpoints. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Select, adapt, or develop viewpoints and model kinds based on stakeholder concerns. 2) Establish or identify potential architecture framework(s) to be used in developing models and views. NOTE Some architecture frameworks identify stakeholders and their concerns, and relevant viewpoints that address those concerns, while other architecture frameworks are more general in their guidance. Viewpoints specify the kinds of models to be used and how the resulting models can be used to generate architecture views. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for more information on architecture framework and architecture description practices. 3) Capture rationale for selection of framework(s), viewpoints and model types. 4) Select or develop supporting modeling techniques and tools. c) Develop models and views of candidate architectures. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the system context and boundaries in terms of interfaces and interactions with external entities. NOTE This task is mainly based on the outcomes of the Business or Mission Analysis process, and is performed concurrently with the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process. It consists of identifying the entities external to the system (i.e., existing and projected systems, products, and services that constitute the system context) and defining the boundaries of the system (i.e., interactions with these external entities through the interfaces that cross the boundaries). The external entities could include the necessary enabling systems. The Architecture Definition process defines interfaces to the extent needed to support essential architectural decisions and understanding.  These interface definitions are then refined by the Design Definition process. 2) Identify architectural entities and relationships between entities that address key stakeholder concerns and critical system requirements. NOTE Architecture is not necessarily concerned with all requirements, but rather only with those that drive the architecture. On the other hand, the Design Definition process takes into account all the requirements. Sometimes, through the Architecture Definition process there will be requirements that are deemed to be inappropriate, unaffordable, or unsuitable. These are requirements issues that are resolved through iteration of the System Requirements Definition process. It is also important that the architecture addresses key stakeholder concerns since not all of these will be captured in requirements.

NOTE The items being allocated to could be physical, logical, or conceptual. 4) Select, adapt, or develop models of the candidate architectures of the system. NOTE It is common to use models in architecture definition. The models used are those that best address key stakeholder concerns. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for how this can be done. Historically, it has been common to use logical and physical models in architecture definition. Information on logical, physical, and other models is provided in Annex F.  5) Compose views from the models in accordance with identified viewpoints to express how the architecture addresses stakeholder concerns and meets stakeholder and system requirements. 6) Harmonize the architecture models and views with each other.  NOTE Correspondence rules from frameworks are one way to establish harmony between views. See ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. d) Relate the architecture to design. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify system elements that relate to architectural entities and the nature of these relationships. NOTE Sometimes the system elements are initially notional until Design Definition has occurred since this depends on the actual design(s) to be done. Sometimes a “reference architecture” is created using these notional system elements as a means to convey architectural intent and to check for design feasibility. 2) Define the interfaces and interactions between the system elements and with external entities. NOTE This is defined at level of detail necessary to convey the architectural intent and can be further refined in the Design Definition process. 3) Partition, align and allocate requirements to architectural entities and system elements. 4) Map system elements and architectural entities to design characteristics.   5) Define principles for the system design and evolution. e) Assess architecture candidates. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Assess each candidate architecture against constraints and requirements. 2) Assess each candidate architecture against stakeholder concerns using evaluation criteria. NOTE The System Analysis process and the Risk Management process can be used to support this task. 3) Select the preferred architecture(s) and capture key decisions and rationale. NOTE The Decision Management process can be used to support this task. 4) Establish the architecture baseline of the selected architecture. NOTE The architecture baseline is composed of models, views and other relevant architecture descriptions. f) Manage the selected architecture. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Formalize the architecture governance approach and specify governance related roles and responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities (related to design, quality, security, safety, etc.). 2) Obtain explicit acceptance of the architecture by stakeholders.

NOTE 2 In some applications it is necessary to certify the architecture. Certification confirms that the architectural intent is met, the architectural vision and key concepts are correctly implemented, and stakeholder concerns are properly addressed. It also gives essential feedback to the Architecture Definition process to help in the learning process and to help ensure that future iterations of architecture better address stakeholder concerns. 3) Maintain concordance and completeness of the architectural entities and their architectural characteristics. NOTE The entities to be checked are not only technical. These are also, for example, legal, economical, organizational and operational entities that are normally part of stakeholder requirements and concerns. 4) Organize, assess and control evolution of the architecture models and views. 5) Maintain the architecture definition and evaluation strategy.  NOTE This includes updating the architecture based upon technological, implementation, operational experiences, as well as the management of external and internal interfaces that are defined at this level of system decomposition. 6) Maintain traceability of the architecture. NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the architecture entities (models, views, and viewpoints) to the requirements (including  allocated, decomposed, and derived), interface definitions, analysis results, and verification methods or techniques.  If possible, traceability is also maintained between the architecture entities and the stakeholder concerns.   7) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Architecture Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. 6.4.5 Design definition process 6.4.5.1 Purpose The purpose of the Design Definition process is to provide sufficient detailed data and information about the system and its elements to enable the implementation consistent with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture. NOTE 1 The Architecture Definition process, supports identification of stakeholders and their concerns. Through the use of the process, insights are gained into the relation between the requirements specified for the system and the emergent properties and behaviors of the system that arise from the interactions and relations between the system elements. The Design Definition process, on the other hand, is driven by requirements that have been vetted through the architecture and more detailed analyses of feasibility. Architecture focuses on suitability, viability, and desirability, whereas design focuses on compatibility with technologies and other design elements and feasibility of construction and integration. An effective architecture is as design-agnostic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility in the design trade space. NOTE 2 Design definition considers any applicable technologies and their contribution to the system solution. Design provides the ‘implement-to’ level of the definition, such as drawings and detailed design descriptions. NOTE 3 This process provides feedback to the system architecture to consolidate or confirm the allocation, partitioning and alignment of architectural entities to system elements that compose the system. 6.4.5.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Design Definition process: a) Design characteristics of each system element are defined. b) System requirements are allocated to system elements. c) Design enablers necessary for design definition are selected or defined.

This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Determine technologies required for each system element composing the system. NOTE Several technologies are sometimes used for a given system element (e.g., mechanics, electronics, software, operator roles, etc.). 2) Determine the necessary design characteristics types. NOTE For each technology the necessary design characteristics types (e.g., detailed patterns, structures, size, volume, gauge, template, etc.) are defined.  Design characteristics include security considerations such as the principle of least privilege, layered defenses, restricted access to system services, and other considerations to minimize and defend the system attack surface. 3) Define principles for evolution of the design. NOTE This includes defining periodic assessment of the design characteristics in case of evolution of the system and of its architecture as well as forecasting potential obsolescence of system elements and technologies, their replacement by others over time in the system life cycle, and the consequences for the design definition. 4) Define the design definition strategy. 5) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support design definition. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for design definition include tools for collaboration and design development, and design reuse repositories (for design patterns, design artifacts, design standards, etc.). 6) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Establish design characteristics and design enablers related to each system element. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Allocate system requirements to system elements. NOTE Some of the system requirements may have already been allocated to system elements during architecture definition. The purpose of this task is to complete the allocation to the extent necessary to address all system requirements. 2) Transform architectural characteristics into design characteristics. NOTE This task transforms each architectural characteristic related to architectural entities assigned to the system element into design characteristics (dimensions, shapes, materials, critical quality characteristics, data processing Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  63 structures, etc.) using adequate representation such as drawings, diagrams, models, architectures, tables of metrics and their values, etc.; every data is associated with detailed acceptable margins for implementation (if relevant at this step). 3) Define the necessary design enablers.  NOTE This task defines and/or selects the necessary design enablers such as models, equations, algorithms, calculations, formal expressions and values of parameters, patterns, heuristics, etc. that are associated to design characteristics.  Compatibility, affordability, security, and other critical properties in the context of their planned operational environment are considerations during the definition of necessary design enablers.  ISO 9241-210 provides human centered design/ergonomic design guidelines. 4) Examine design alternatives. NOTE Assess the feasibility of design characteristics and perform trades in the architecture or requirements when design characteristics cannot be implemented.  5) Refine or define the interfaces between the system elements and with external entities. NOTE Interfaces are identified and defined in the Architecture Definition process to the level or extent needed for the architecture intent and understanding.  They are refined in Design Definition process based on the design characteristics, interfaces and interactions of the system element with other system elements composing the system and with external entities. Additional interfaces might need to be identified and defined that were not addressed in the architecture definition.   6) Establish the design artifacts. NOTE This task formalizes the design characteristics of the system element through dedicated artifacts depending on the implementation technology. Examples of artifacts include data sheets (electronics), databases (software), documents (operator role), and exportable data files (mechanics).  c) Assess alternatives for obtaining system elements. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify any candidate Non-Developmental-Items (NDI) that may be considered for use. NOTE This includes COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf), reuse of a previous design, or acquirer provided items. 2) Assess each candidate NDI and new design alternative against criteria developed from expected design characteristics or system element requirements to determine suitability for the intended application. 3) Determine the preferred alternative among any candidate NDI solutions and new design alternatives for a system element. NOTE The System Analysis process is used for analyses or assessments, as well as the Decision Management process to perform the selection. d) Manage the design. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Map design characteristics up to the system elements. NOTE 1 This task consists of establishing traceability between the detailed design characteristics and the architectural entities of the system architecture. NOTE 2 This facilitates providing feedback to the Architecture Definition process to possibly modify the physical arrangement of system elements in order to obtain architectural characteristics (e.g., modularity, usability, inter-operability, safeguard, etc.) as expected for the parent system architecture to meet stakeholder concerns. 2) Capture design and rationale  NOTE 1 Rationale includes information about major implementation options and enablers. NOTE 2 The Verification and Validation processes are invoked to verify and validate each detailed design characteristic and implementation option.

NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the design characteristics and the architectural entities, identified interfaces, analysis results, verification methods or techniques, and system element requirements. 4) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Design Definition) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. 6.4.6 System analysis process 6.4.6.1 Purpose The purpose of the System Analysis process is to provide a rigorous basis of data and information for technical understanding to aid decision-making across the life cycle.   The System Analysis process applies to the development of inputs needed for any technical assessment.  It can provide confidence in the utility and integrity of system requirements, architecture, and design. System analysis covers a wide range of differing analytic functions, levels of complexity, and levels of rigor. It includes mathematical analysis, modeling, simulation, experimentation, and other techniques to analyze technical performance, system behavior, feasibility, affordability, critical quality characteristics, technical risks, life cycle costs, and to perform sensitivity analysis of the potential range of values for parameters across all life cycle stages.  It is used for a wide range of analytical needs concerning operational concepts, determination of requirement values, resolution of requirements conflicts, assessment of alternative architectures or system elements, and evaluation of engineering strategies (integration, verification, validation, and maintenance). Formality and rigor of the analysis will depend on the criticality of the information need or work product supported, the amount of information/data available, the size of the project, and the schedule for the results.  NOTE This process is often used in conjunction with the Decision Management process. 6.4.6.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the System Analysis process: a) System analyses needed are identified.  b) System analysis assumptions and results are validated. c) System analysis results are provided for decisions.  d) Any enabling systems or services needed for system analysis are available.  e) Traceability of the system analysis results is established. 6.4.6.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the System Analysis process. a) Prepare for system analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify the problem or question that requires system analysis.  NOTE This includes technical, functional, and non-functional objectives of the analysis.  Non-functional objectives include critical quality characteristics, various properties, technology maturity, manufacturing maturity, technical risks, etc.  The problem statement or question to be answered by the analysis is essential to establish the objectives of the analysis and the expectations and utility of the results. 2) Identify the stakeholders of the system analysis.

NOTE The necessary level of fidelity (accuracy or precision) is a factor in determining the appropriate level of rigor.   4) Select the system analysis methods. NOTE The methods are chosen based on time, cost, fidelity, technical drivers, and criticality of analysis.  Analysis methods have a wide range of levels of rigor and include expert judgment, “back of the envelope” calculation, spreadsheet computations, historical data and trend analysis, engineering models, simulation, visualization, and prototyping. Due to cost and schedule constraints, most systems only perform system analysis for critical characteristics.  5) Define the system analysis strategy. 6) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support system analysis.  NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. The system analysis enabling systems include the tools, relevant models, and potential data repositories needed to support the analysis. The methods chosen will be a major factor in determining what tools are appropriate to support the analysis.  This also includes determining the availability of relevant models and data.   7) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 8) Collect the data and inputs needed for the analysis.  b) Perform system analysis. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify and validate assumptions.  2) Apply the selected analysis methods to perform the required system analysis. 3) Review the analysis results for quality and validity.   NOTE The results are coordinated with associated analyses that have been previously completed. 4) Establish conclusions and recommendations.   NOTE The appropriate subject matter experts and stakeholders are identified and engaged in this task.  5) Record the results of the system analysis, c) Manage system analysis.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Maintain traceability of system analysis results.  NOTE Through the life cycle, bi-directional traceability is maintained between the system analysis results and any system definition item for which the analysis is supporting a decision or providing rationale (e.g., system requirement values, architecture alternatives). This is often facilitated by an appropriate data repository. 2) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines.  NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (System Analysis) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the analysis results or reports are typical information items that are baselined.  6.4.7 Implementation process 6.4.7.1 Purpose The purpose of the Implementation process is to realize a specified system element.

This process results in a system element that satisfies specified system requirements (including allocated and derived requirements), architecture, and design.  NOTE This applies to both a single element (concept and development stage) and production run (as in production stage).  It also can apply in the resolution of changes needed in the Support stage. 6.4.7.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Implementation process: a) Implementation constraints that influence the requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) A system element is realized. c) A system element is packaged or stored.  d) Any enabling systems or services needed for implementation are available. e) Traceability is established. 6.4.7.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Implementation process. a) Prepare for implementation.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define an implementation strategy. NOTE 1 Implementation strategies include build new, acquire new, or re-use existing elements (with or without modification),  If the strategy is reuse, then the project will need to determine the level, source, and suitability of the reused system elements. The implementation strategy includes implementation procedures, fabrication processes, tools and equipment, implementation tolerances and verification uncertainties. In the case of repeated system element implementation (e.g., mass production, replacement system elements) the implementation procedures and fabrication processes are defined to achieve consistent and repeatable producibility.  NOTE 2 The implementation strategy often invokes the Agreement processes, or requires enabling systems and services that include specialized life cycle development and support environments. 2) Identify constraints from the implementation strategy and implementation technology on the system requirements, architecture characteristics, design characteristics, or implementation techniques.  NOTE This includes current or anticipated limitations of the chosen implementation technology, acquirer furnished materials or system elements for adaptation and limitations resulting from the use of required implementation enabling systems. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support implementation. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services, and materials to be used.

NOTE This is done using the implementation enabling systems and specified resources. Realizing system elements may include developing or purchasing them.  Adaptation includes configuration of system elements that are reused or modified.  Realization or adaptation is conducted with regard to standards that govern applicable safety, security, privacy and environmental guidelines or legislation and the practices of the relevant implementation technology.  i) Hardware  Hardware elements are either acquired or fabricated.  Hardware elements are fabricated using applicable techniques relevant to the physical implementation technology and materials selected.  As appropriate, hardware elements are verified for conformance to specified system requirements and critical quality characteristics. ii) Software  System elements realized in software are either acquired or developed.  As appropriate, these elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and design criteria. ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 applies to system elements realized in software. iii) Services Service elements include a set of services to be provided.  As appropriate, service elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and service criteria. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), applies to system elements realized in services. iv) Utilization and Support Resources Other system elements include utilization and support resources such as operational procedures, maintenance procedures, user training, etc.  As appropriate, utilization and support resource elements are verified for conformance to the system requirements and operational concept. 2) Package and store the system element.

NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Implementation) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the system elements are typical information items that are baselined. 6.4.8 Integration process 6.4.8.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Integration process is to synthesize a set of system elements into a realized system (product or service) that satisfies system requirements, architecture, and design. This process assembles the implemented system elements. Interfaces are identified and activated to enable interoperation of the system elements as intended. This process integrates the enabling systems with the system-of-interest to facilitate interoperation. NOTE 1 For a given level of the system hierarchy, this process iteratively combines implemented system elements to form complete or partial system configurations in order to build a product or service.  It is used recursively for successive levels of the system hierarchy.  NOTE 2 The interfaces are defined by the Architecture Definition and Design Definition processes. This process coordinates with these other processes and checks to make sure the interface definitions are adequate and that they take into account the integration needs.   6.4.8.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Integration process: a) Integration constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or design, including interfaces, are identified.  b) Approach and checkpoints for the correct operation of the assembled interfaces and system functions are defined. c) Any enabling systems or services needed for integration are available. d) A system composed of implemented system elements is integrated. e) The interfaces between the implemented system elements that compose the system are checked. f) The interfaces between the system and the external environment are checked. g) Integration results and anomalies are identified.  h) Traceability of the integrated system elements is established. 6.4.8.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Integration process. a) Prepare for integration. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Identify and define check points for the correct operation and integrity of the assembled interfaces and the selected system functions.   NOTE 1 Detailed verification of the interfaces is performed using the Verification process.  NOTE 2 Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 and the ISO/IEC 27000 series for information on assurance, integrity, and security.  Consider anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper, system and software assurance and interoperability elements when identifying and defining checkpoints.

NOTE 2 This strategy often provides for verification against a sequence of progressively more complete system element configurations. It is dependent on system element availability and is consistent with a fault isolation and diagnosis strategy. Wherever possible, an integrated configuration includes its human operators. Successive applications of the Integration process and the Verification process, and when appropriate the Validation process, are repeated for systems at successive levels until the system-of-interest has been realized. 3) Identify and plan for  the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support integration. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. Enabling systems for integration include the integration facilities, assembly equipment, training systems, discrepancy reporting systems, simulators, measurement devices, and facility security.  Changes needed for the enabling systems to support the integration tasks need to be identified and defined.  The need for these changes are provided to the stakeholders that govern the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services, and materials to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the integration enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 5) Identify system constraints from integration to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture or design. NOTE This includes requirements such as accessibility, safety for integrators, required interconnections for sets of implemented system elements and for enablers, and interface constraints.   b) Perform integration - Successively integrate system element configurations until the complete system is synthesized. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Obtain implemented system elements in accordance with agreed schedules. NOTE The implemented system elements are received from suppliers, the acquirer, or withdrawn from storage. System elements are handled in accordance with relevant health, safety, security and privacy considerations.  As part of the acceptance of the implemented system elements, each element is checked to help ensure it has been verified and validated against acceptance criteria specified in an agreement. The delivered configuration, conformance, compatibility of interfaces, the presence of mandatory information items are checked. Implemented system elements that do not pass verification are identified as such and handled in accordance with defined procedures. 2) Assemble the implemented system elements. NOTE The assembly is performed to achieve system element configuration (complete or partial) connecting the implemented system elements as prescribed in the integration strategy, using the defined assembly procedures, interface control descriptions, and the related integration enabling systems.   3) Perform check of the interfaces, selected functions, and critical quality characteristics. NOTE This is performed to help ensure the operation of the interfaces (external and internal), functions, and quality characteristics.  The interfaces are checked using the Verification process against the interface requirements. c) Manage results of integration. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record integration results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the integration strategy, the integration enabling systems, execution of the integration or incorrect system or element definition. Where inconsistencies exist at the interface between the system, its specified operational environment and any systems that enable the utilization stage, the deviations lead to corrective actions or requirement changes.  The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Maintain traceability of the integrated system elements.

This process (Integration) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the integration strategy is a typical information item that is baselined. 6.4.9 Verification process  6.4.9.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system or system element fulfils its specified requirements and characteristics. The Verification process identifies the anomalies (errors, defects, or faults) in any information item (e.g., system requirements or architecture description), implemented system elements, or life cycle processes using appropriate methods, techniques, standards or rules. This process provides the necessary information to determine resolution of identified anomalies.  NOTE The Verification process determines that the ""product is built right"".  The Validation process determines that the ""right product is built"". 6.4.9.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Verification process: a) Constraints of verification that influence the requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for verification are available. c) The system or system element is verified. d) Data providing information for corrective actions is reported. e) Objective evidence that the realized system fulfils the requirements, architecture and design is provided.  f) Verification results and anomalies are identified. g) Traceability of the verified system elements is established. 6.4.9.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Verification process. a) Prepare for verification. This activity consists of the following tasks: NOTE This strategy generally focuses on minimizing cost and schedule, and/or risk, providing a balanced approach for confirming that the system or system element has been “built right”. 1) Identify the verification scope and corresponding verification actions. NOTE Scope includes requirements, architecture and design characteristics or other properties to be verified.  For each verification action, the strategy describes the system element or artifact to be verified (the actual system, or a model, a mock-up, a prototype, a procedure, a plan or other document), and the expected result, such as from its performance or conformance. Design characteristics include security implications of the design in the context of the planned operational environment and the achievement of critical quality characteristics. 2) Identify the constraints that potentially limit the feasibility of verification actions.

NOTE 2 The verification strategy and schedule are updated according to the progress of the project; in particular planned verification actions are redefined or rescheduled when unexpected events or system evolutions occur. 5) Identify system constraints from the verification strategy to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture, or design. NOTE This includes practical limitations of accuracy, uncertainty, repeatability that are imposed by the verification enablers, the associated measurement methods, the need for system integration, and the availability, accessibility and interconnection with enablers. 6) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support verification. NOTE Verification enabling systems include verification equipment, simulators, test automation tools, facilities, etc. 7) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used to support verification. NOTE The acquisition of the enabling systems can be done through various ways such as rental, procurement, development, reuse, subcontracting; usually the acquisition of the complete set of enablers is a mix of these ways. The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the verification enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Perform verification. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define the verification procedures, each supporting one or a set of verification actions. NOTE The procedures identify the purpose of the verification with success criteria (expected results), the verification technique to be applied, the necessary enabling systems (facilities, equipment, etc.), and the environmental conditions to perform each verification procedure (resources, qualified personnel, etc.). 2) Perform the verification procedures.

NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the validated system elements and the validation strategy, mission/business analysis, life cycle concepts, stakeholder requirements, system architecture, design, and system requirements. 5) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines. This process (Validation) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. For this process, the validation strategy is a typical information item that is baselined. 6.4.12 Operation process 6.4.12.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Operation process is to use the system to deliver its services.   This process establishes requirements for and assigns personnel to operate the system, and monitors the services and operator-system performance.  In order to sustain services it identifies and analyzes operational anomalies in relation to agreements, stakeholder requirements and organizational constraints. NOTE ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), provides requirements for establishing a service management system, which supports the Operation process to achieve its purpose. 6.4.12.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Operation process: a) Operation constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) Any enabling systems, services, and material needed for operation are available. c) Trained, qualified operators are available. d) System services that meet stakeholder requirements are delivered. e) System performance during operation is monitored.  f) Support to the customer is provided. 6.4.12.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Operation process. a) Prepare for operation.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define an operation strategy.  NOTE This defines approaches, schedules, resources, and specific considerations required to perform system operation.  It often includes: i) The availability of services as they are introduced, routinely operated and withdrawn from service. It can include co-ordination with pre-existing, concurrent or continuing services delivered by other systems that provide identical or similar services.

NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the operation enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 5) Identify or define training and qualification requirements for personnel needed for system operation. 6) Assign trained, qualified personnel to be operators. NOTE The training and qualification includes awareness of the system in its operational environment and a defined programmed of familiarization, with appropriate failure detection and isolation instruction.  Operator knowledge, skill and experience requirements guide the personnel selection criteria, and where relevant, their authorization to operate is confirmed.  The scope of qualification depends on the system-of-interest and its environment. For example, in some environments regulatory requirements include certification of operators, whereas in others there is no certification requirement.  A training mode of the operational system sometimes impacts service availability.  b) Perform operation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Use the system in its intended operational environment.  NOTE The Operation Strategy guides the system usage.  Where agreed, continuous service capacity and quality is maintained when the system replaces an existing system that is being retired.  During a specified period of changeover or concurrent operation, the transfer of services is managed so that continuing conformance to persistent stakeholder needs is achieved. 2) Apply materials and other resources, as required, to operate the system and sustain its services. NOTE This includes energy sources for hardware and provisions for operators. 3) Monitor system operation. NOTE 1 This includes:  i) Managing adherence to the operation strategy. ii) Assuring that the system is operated in a safe manner and compliant with legislated guidelines concerning occupational safety and environmental protection.

NOTE 2 Monitoring the system includes reviewing that the performance is within established thresholds, periodic instrument readings are acceptable, and service and response times are acceptable.  Operator feedback and suggestions are useful input for improving system operational performance. NOTE 3 Cost of operation is also monitored against objectives and constraints, and to identify potential improvements. 4) Identify and record when system service performance is not within acceptable parameters. NOTE The system sometimes exhibits unacceptable performance when system elements implemented in hardware have exceeded their useful life or the system’s operational environment affects the operating and maintenance personnel (including staff turnover, operator stress and fatigue). 5) Perform system contingency operations, if necessary.  NOTE This includes operating the system in a degraded mode, performing back-out and restore operation, system shutdown, implementation of work-around procedures to restore operation, or other modes for special conditions.  If needed, the operator performs steps necessary to enter into contingency operations and possibly power down the system.  Contingency operations are performed in accordance with pre-established procedures for such an event. Often these procedures are accompanied by a continuity plan.   c) Manage results of operation. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record  results of operation and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the operation strategy, the operation enabling systems, execution of the operation, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Record operational incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE 1 Performing problem resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. Any actual changes to the requirements, architecture, design, or system elements are done within other Technical Processes. NOTE 2 If an incident is experienced during operation, the operator records the incident and performs actions prescribed in validated operating procedures to restore normal operations.  3) Maintain traceability of the Operations elements. NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the Operations elements and the business or mission needs, operational concept, concept of operations, and stakeholder requirements. 4) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Operation) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. d) Support the customer. This activity consists of the following task: 1) Provide assistance and consultation to the customers as requested.   NOTE Assistance and consultation includes the providing of or providing recommended sources for training, documentation, vulnerability resolution, anti-counterfeit reporting, and other support services supporting effective use of the product. 2) Record and monitor requests and subsequent actions for support. 3) Determine the degree to which delivered system services satisfy the needs of the customers.

Wherever possible the benefit of such action is agreed with stakeholders or their representatives.  The customer satisfaction data also serves as an input to the Quality Management process.  6.4.13 Maintenance process 6.4.13.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Maintenance process is to sustain the capability of the system to provide a service.   This process monitors the system’s capability to deliver services, records incidents for analysis, takes corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive actions and confirms restored capability. 6.4.13.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Maintenance process: a) Maintenance constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or design are identified. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for maintenance are available. c) Replacement, repaired, or revised system elements are made available. d) The need for changes to address corrective, perfective, or adaptive maintenance is reported. e) Failure and lifetime data, including associated costs, is determined. 6.4.13.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Maintenance process. a) Prepare for maintenance.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a maintenance strategy. NOTE 1 The maintenance strategy, also known as the maintenance concept, defines the approaches, schedules, resources, and specific considerations required to perform corrective and preventive maintenance in conformance with operational availability requirements.  It generally includes: i) The corrective and preventive maintenance strategy to sustain service in the operational environment in order to achieve customer satisfaction. ii) The scheduled preventive maintenance actions that reduce the likelihood of system failure without undue loss of services or impact on normal operations, (e.g., suspension or restriction of the services). iii) The logistics strategy throughout the life cycle, including acquisition logistics (helps ensure supportability implications are considered early during the Development stage) and operations logistics (helps ensure that the necessary material and resources, in the right quantity and quality, are available at the right place and time throughout the Utilization and Support Stages). iv) The number and type of replacement system elements to be stored, their storage locations and conditions, their anticipated replacement rate, and their storage life and renewal frequency. v) Approach to assure that counterfeit system elements are not introduced into the system. vi) The skill and personnel levels required to effect repairs, replacements, and restoration accounting for maintenance staff requirements and any relevant legislation regarding health and safety, security and the environment. vii) Measures for maintenance that will provide insight into performance levels, effectiveness, and efficiency.

It provides a systematic approach to defining a routine maintenance program composed of cost-effective tasks that preserve important functions.  SAE JA1011:2009, Evaluation Criteria for Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) Processes, provides detailed information. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM/CBM+) is a strategy to improve system reliability by reducing the amount of time the system is unavailable while conducting routine or corrective maintenance.   NOTE 3 In most cases, the extension of capability, mid-life upgrade, or evolution of legacy systems becomes a new system development project that will apply the set of processes within an appropriate life cycle as applicable. 2) Identify system constraints from maintenance to be incorporated in the system requirements, architecture, or design.   NOTE These often result from the need to 1) re-use existing maintenance enabling systems; 2) re-use existing holdings of replaceable system element and accommodate re-supply limitations; 3) conduct maintenance in specific locations or environments. 3) Identify trades such that the system and associated maintenance and logistics actions results in a solution that is affordable, operable, supportable, and sustainable. NOTE The System Analysis and Decision Management processes are used to perform the assessments and trade decisions. 4) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support maintenance. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 5) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the maintenance enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. b) Perform maintenance.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Review incident and problem reports to identify future corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive maintenance needs. 2) Record maintenance incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE 1 If an incident is experienced during maintenance, the maintenance staff records the incident and performs actions prescribed in validated maintenance procedures.   NOTE 2 Performing maintenance problem identification and resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. 3) Implement the procedures for correction of random faults or scheduled replacement of system elements. NOTE For random system failures, the fault is isolated down to the planned level of system element replacement, repair, revision, or reconfiguration. Then the corrective actions for the system element are performed and correct system performance is verified.  Actions are recorded in order to estimate the useful life of degradable system elements.   4) Upon encountering random faults that cause a system failure, deploy actions to restore the system to operational status.  NOTE Restoration to full operational status may not be possible until the cause of the fault is corrected.  In that case, the system is restored to a degraded mode consistent with the contingency planning.   5) Perform preventive maintenance by replacing or servicing system elements prior to failure, according to planned schedules and maintenance procedures. 6) Perform failure identification actions when a non-compliance has occurred in the system.

NOTE Adaptive and perfective maintenance actions usually involve change to the system requirements, architecture or design.  It may be necessary to establish a new project to modify the existing system.  If so, the Portfolio Management process may be the starting point to initiate the work from the Development stage.  c) Perform logistics support.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Perform acquisition logistics. NOTE Acquisition Logistics considerations are included in the agreement resulting from the Agreement processes. Supportability implications are also considered during the Development stage. This includes performing analysis to determine whether it is more cost effective to influence the initial design of the system or to plan for spare parts and repairs during utilization.  These decisions are often constrained by availability requirements and impact the supply chain management.  Acquisition logistics considers the supportability needs of the system concurrently with the definition of the system requirements. 2) Perform operational logistics. NOTE Operational logistics is the concurrent tuning of both the SOI and enabling systems throughout the operational life to help ensure effective and efficient delivery of system functions.  It also includes taking the steps necessary to help ensure that the necessary material and resources, in the right quantity and quality, are available at the right place and time.   3) Implement any packaging, handling, storage and transportation needed during the life cycle. NOTE This includes packaging, handling, storage and transportation for the system, system elements, and the required replacement system elements.  This is often required to support the objectives of the Integration and Transition processes. 4) Confirm that logistics actions satisfy the required replenishment levels so that stored system elements meet repair rates and planned schedules. NOTE Monitor the quality and availability of spares, their transportation and their continued integrity during storage.  Acquire, train and accredit, as necessary, personnel to maintain operator numbers and skills. 5) Confirm that logistics actions include supportability requirements that are planned, resourced, and implemented. NOTE The logistics actions enable the system to achieve operational readiness.  The actions include staffing, supply support, support equipment, technical data needs (manuals, instructions, lists, etc.), training support, equipment/computing resource support, and facilities.  d) Manage results of maintenance and logistics. This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Record maintenance and logistics results and any anomalies encountered. NOTE This includes anomalies due to the maintenance strategy, the maintenance enabling systems, execution of the maintenance and logistics, or incorrect system definition. The Project Assessment and Control process is used to analyze the data to identify the root cause, enable corrective or improvement actions, and to record lessons learned. 2) Record operational incidents and problems and track their resolution.  NOTE Performing problem resolution is handled through the Quality Assurance and Project Assessment and Control processes. Any actual changes to the requirements, architecture, design, or system elements are done within other Technical Processes. 3) Identify and record trends of incidents, problems, and maintenance and logistics actions. NOTE 1 This is used to inform operations and maintenance personnel, and other projects that are creating or utilizing similar system entities. NOTE 2 Incident and problem reporting, including resulting action taken, is tracked through Incident and process Management activity of the Quality Assurance process.

NOTE Bi-directional traceability is maintained between the maintenance actions and the system elements and life cycle artifacts. 5) Provide key information items that have been selected for baselines. NOTE The Configuration Management process is used to establish and maintain configuration items and baselines.  This process (Maintenance) identifies candidates for the baseline, and then provides the information items to CM. Examples include maintenance plans and life cycle support plans. 6) Monitor customer satisfaction with system and maintenance support. NOTE The customer satisfaction data is used in the Quality Management process. ISO 10004:2012 contains guidelines for monitoring and measuring customer satisfaction. 6.4.14 Disposal process 6.4.14.1 Purpose  The purpose of the Disposal process is to end the existence of a system element or system for a specified intended use, appropriately handle replaced or retired elements, and to properly attend to identified critical disposal needs (e.g., per an agreement, per organizational policy, or for environmental, legal, safety, security aspects). This process deactivates, disassembles and removes the system or any of its system elements from the specific use.  It addresses any waste products, consigning them to a final condition and returning the environment to its original or an acceptable condition.  The waste products can be in-process resulting during any life cycle stage, e.g., waste materials during fabrication.  This process destroys, stores or reclaims system elements and waste products in an environmentally sound manner, in accordance with legislation, agreements, organizational constraints and stakeholder requirements.  Disposal includes preventing expired, non-reusable, or inadequate elements from getting back into the supply chain.  Where required, it maintains records in order that the health of operators and users, and the safety of the environment, can be monitored.  When part of the system will continue to be in use in a modified form, the Disposal process helps ensure the proper handling of the portion being retired.  NOTE The Disposal process is intended to be applicable throughout the life cycle of the system, including disposing prototypes during the Concept and Development stages, dealing with waste during the Production stage, and decommissioning elements from modifications during the Utilization and Support stages.  6.4.14.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Disposal process: a) Disposal constraints are provided as inputs to requirements, architecture, design, and implementation. b) Any enabling systems or services needed for disposal are available. c) The system elements or waste products are destroyed, stored, reclaimed or recycled in accordance with safety and security requirements. d) The environment is returned to its original or an agreed state. e) Records of disposal actions and analysis are available. 6.4.14.3 Activities and tasks The project shall implement the following activities and tasks in accordance with applicable organization policies and procedures with respect to the Disposal process. a) Prepare for disposal.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Define a disposal strategy for the system, to include each system element and any resulting waste products.

NOTE This includes issues of disassembly, including their associated enabling systems, access to and availability of storage locations and available skill levels. 3) Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support disposal. NOTE This includes identification of requirements and interfaces for the enabling systems. 4) Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used. NOTE The Validation process is used to objectively confirm that the disposal enabling system achieves its intended use for its enabling functions. 5) Specify containment facilities, storage locations, inspection criteria and storage periods, if the system is to be stored. 6) Define preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed or reused from re-entering the supply chain. b) Perform disposal.  This activity consists of the following tasks: 1) Deactivate the system or system element to prepare it for removal. NOTE Interfaces to other systems are considered, e.g., power or fuel are disconnected in accordance with disassembly instructions, and relevant health, safety, security and privacy legislation. When the System-of-Interest is being modified for technology or capability upgrades, only the impacted system elements are deactivated and removed.  This can apply to a prototype of the System-of-Interest during the Concept or Development stage,  2) Remove the system, system element, or waste material from use or production for appropriate disposition and action.  NOTE The disposition includes reuse, recycling, reconditioning, overhaul, or destruction.  The disposition and subsequent actions are conducted in accordance with relevant safety, security, privacy and environmental standards, directives and laws.  Elements of the system that have useful life remaining, either in their current condition or following overhaul or modification, are transferred to other systems-of-interest or organizations.  Where appropriate, recondition system elements to extend their useful life.  Reallocate, redeploy or retire operators.  When the element is expired, non-reusable, or inadequate, it is necessary to prevent the elements from getting back into the supply chain.  This task includes the removal of waste material from production or other stages.  3) Withdraw impacted operating staff from the system or system element and record relevant operating knowledge. NOTE This is conducted in accordance with relevant safety, security, privacy and environmental standards, directives and laws. Act to safeguard and secure knowledge and skills possessed by operators.  Refer to knowledge management process. 4) Disassemble the system or system element into manageable elements to facilitate its removal for reuse, recycling, reconditioning, overhaul, archiving or destruction.

NOTE 1 Tailoring is not a requirement for conformance to the standard. In fact, tailoring is not permitted if a claim of ""full conformance"" is to be made. If a claim of ""tailored conformance"" is made, then this process is applied to perform the tailoring. NOTE 2 Additional guidance for tailoring can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE TR 24748 guides, on the application of life cycle processes. A.2 Tailoring process A.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Tailoring process is to adapt the processes of this International Standard to satisfy particular circumstances or factors that: a) Surround an organization that is employing this International Standard in an agreement; b) Influence a project that is required to meet an agreement in which this International Standard is referenced; c) Reflect the needs of an organization in order to supply products or services. A.2.2 Outcomes As a result of the successful implementation of the Tailoring process: a) Modified or new life cycle processes are defined to achieve the purposes and outcomes of a life cycle model. A.2.3 Activities and tasks If this International Standard is tailored, then the organization or project shall implement the following tasks in accordance with applicable policies and procedures with respect to the Tailoring process, as required. a) Identify and record the circumstances that influence tailoring. These influences include, but are not limited to: 1) stability of, and variety in, operational environments; 2) risks, commercial or performance, to the concern of interested parties; 3) novelty, size and complexity; 4) starting date and duration of utilization; 5) integrity issues such as safety, security, privacy, usability, availability; 6) emerging technology opportunities; Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  © ISO/IEC 2015  All rights reserved  © IEEE 2015  All rights reserved  87 7) profile of budget and organizational resources available; 8) availability of the services of enabling systems; 9) roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities in the overall life cycle of the system; 10) the need to conform to other standards. b) In the case of properties critical to the system, take due account of the life cycle structures recommended or mandated by standards relevant to the dimension of the criticality. c) Obtain input from parties affected by the tailoring decisions.  This includes, but may not be limited to: 1) the system stakeholders; 2) the interested parties to an agreement made by the organization; 3) the contributing organizational functions. d) Make tailoring decisions in accordance with the Decision Management process to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the selected life cycle model. NOTE 1 Organizations establish standard life cycle models as a part of the Life Cycle Model Management process. It is sometimes appropriate for an organization to tailor processes of this International Standard in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a life cycle model to be established. NOTE 2 Projects select an organizationally-established life cycle model for the project as a part of the Project Planning process. It is sometimes appropriate to tailor organizationally adopted processes to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of the selected life cycle model. NOTE 3 In cases where projects are directly applying this International Standard, it is sometimes appropriate to tailor processes of this International Standard in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a suitable life cycle model. e) Select the life cycle processes that require tailoring and delete selected outcomes, activities, or tasks. NOTE 1 Irrespective of tailoring, organizations and projects are always permitted to implement processes that achieve additional outcomes or implement additional activities and tasks beyond those required for conformance to this standard.  NOTE 2 An organization or project sometimes encounter a situation where there is the desire to modify a provision of this International Standard. Modification is to be avoided because of unanticipated consequences on other processes, outcomes, activities or tasks. If necessary, modification is performed by deleting the provision (making the appropriate claim of tailored conformance) and, with careful consideration of consequences, implementing a process that achieves additional outcomes or performs additional activities and tasks beyond those of the tailored standard.

model for assessment purposes C.1 Introduction It is understood that some users of this International Standard may desire to assess the implemented processes in accordance with ISO/IEC 15504-2. This annex provides a Process Reference Model suitable for use in conjunction with that standard. The Process Reference Model is composed of the processes in the body of this International Standard, including the name, statement of purpose, and statement of outcomes for each process.  Clause C.3 identifies the processes in the process reference model and the clauses in which they are defined.  C.2 Conformance with ISO/IEC 15504-2 C.2.1 General ISO/IEC 15504-2 subclause 6.2 places requirements on process reference models suitable for assessment by that standard. The following sections quote the requirements for process reference models and describe how these are met by this international standard. In each of the following subclauses the italicized text quotes the requirement from the text of ISO/IEC 15504-2 and the non-italicized (upright) text describes the manner in which the requirement is satisfied in this International Standard.  C.2.2 Requirements for process reference models A Process Reference Model shall contain: a) A declaration of the domain of the Process Reference Model. This is provided in Clause 1. b) A description, meeting the requirements of subclause 6.2.4 of this International Standard [15504], of the processes within the scope of the Process Reference Model. This is provided in Annex C.3. c) A description of the relationship between the Process Reference Model and its intended context of use. This is provided by Clause 5. d) A description of the relationship between the processes defined within the Process Reference Model. This is provided in Annex C.3 in the description of each process. For example, some process descriptions include the statement that the process contains lower-level processes. The Process Reference Model shall document the community of interest of the model and the actions taken to achieve consensus within that community of interest: a) The relevant community of interest shall be characterized or specified. The relevant community of interest is the users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. b) The extent of achievement of consensus shall be documented. Both ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 are international standards satisfying the consensus requirements of ISO/IEC JTC1. c) If no actions are taken to achieve consensus, a statement to this effect shall be documented. (Not applicable). The processes defined within a Process Reference Model shall have unique process descriptions and identification. The process descriptions are unique. The identification is provided by unique names and by the clause numbering of this annex.

The process descriptions in the Process Reference Model incorporate a statement of the purpose of the process, which describes at a high level the overall objectives of performing the process, together with the set of outcomes that demonstrates successful achievement of the process purpose. These process descriptions shall meet the following requirements: a) a process shall be described in terms of its purpose and outcomes; b) in any process description the set of process outcomes shall be necessary and sufficient to achieve the purpose of the process; c) process descriptions shall be such that no aspects of the Measurement Framework as described in Clause 5 of [ISO/IEC 15504-2] beyond level 1 are contained or implied. An outcome statement describes one of the following:  Production of an artifact;  A significant change of state;  Meeting of specified constraints, e.g., requirements, goals, and objectives. These requirements are met by the process descriptions in this annex. Some outcomes might be interpreted as contributing to levels of capability above level 1. However, conforming implementation of the relevant processes does not require achievement of these higher levels of capability. C.3 The process reference model The Process Reference Model (PRM) is composed of the statement of purpose and outcomes of each of the processes included in Clause 6 of this International Standard.  The PRM for the system life cycle is composed of the set of processes in Figure 4.

Concepts of continual process improvement and capability assessment are now well established and recognized, and are being standardized in the ISO/IEC 15504 series of standards. The Process Reference Models in Annex C of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 are intended to be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 15504 series of standards for capability assessment of the life cycle processes. Capability determination of processes requires that the process descriptions include a clear statement of the purpose of the process and a description of the expected outcomes. Consistent implementation of the processes is aided by having activities, tasks, and implementation notes defined. Thus, the life cycle processes in both life cycle standards have adopted common process constructs, as defined in Clause D.2, Process constructs and their usage, and is consistent with the process definition guidance contained in ISO/IEC TR 24774.  D.2 Process constructs and their usage The process descriptions in this International Standard follow clearly defined rules. Firstly, they were grouped in a logical fashion. Those groupings are dictated by:  Logical relations among the processes  Responsibility for execution of the processes This International Standard groups the activities that may be performed during the life cycle of the system into four Process Groups. The top level description of these groups can be found in subclause 5.6. Each life cycle process within those groups is described in terms of its purpose and desired outcomes and lists the activities and tasks that need to be performed to achieve those outcomes.  a) Agreement Processes – two processes (subclause 6.1) b) Organizational Project-Enabling Processes – six processes (subclause 6.2) c) Technical Management Processes  – eight processes (subclause 6.3) d) Technical Processes – fourteen processes (subclause 6.4) Consistent application of process description rules allows for the normalized clause numbering.  Within this International Standard a subclause numbered as 6.x denotes a process group and 6.x.y denotes a process within that group. Subclauses numbered as 6.x.y.1 describe the purpose of a process, subclauses numbered 6.x.y.2 describe the outcomes of a process, and subclauses numbered as 6.x.y.3 describe the activities and tasks of a process.  Figure D.1 is a UML representation of process constructs used in this International Standard and in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.

For such interests, a process view can be developed to organize processes, activities, and tasks selected from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 to provide a focus to their particular concern in a manner that cuts across all or parts of the life cycle. This annex provides a process viewpoint that may be used to define process views in these instances. E.2 The process view concept There may be cases where a unified focus is needed for activities and tasks that are selected from disparate processes to provide visibility to a significant concept or thread that cuts across the processes employed across the life cycle. It is useful to advise users of the standards how to identify and define these activities for their use, even though they cannot locate a single process that addresses their specific concern. For this purpose, the concept of a process view has been formulated. Like a process, the description of a process view includes a statement of purpose and outcomes. Unlike a process, the description of a process view does not include activities and tasks. Instead, the description includes guidance explaining how the outcomes can be achieved by employing the activities and tasks of the various processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. Process views can be constructed using the process viewpoint template found in E.3. E.3 Process viewpoint A process view conforms to a process viewpoint. The process viewpoint provided here can be used to create process views.   The process viewpoint is defined by:   its stakeholders: users of the standard;  the concerns it frames: the processes needed to reflect a particular engineering interest.  The contents of resulting process views should include:  process view name;  process view purpose;  process view outcomes; and  identification and description of the processes, activities and tasks that implement the process view, and references to the sources for these processes, activities and tasks in other standards. NOTE The requirements for documenting viewpoints are found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, subclause 5.4. This description is consistent with those requirements.

This example treats the cluster of interests, generally called specialty engineering, which includes but is not limited to such areas as availability, maintainability, reliability, safety, security, human factors, and usability.  Within ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, these ""ilities"" requirements are referred to as ""critical quality characteristics"". These characteristics determine how well the product meets its specified requirements in a specific area selected for focus.  NOTE This is a generalized instance of a process view that covers a broad set of functional and non-functional characteristics related to specialty engineering. It provides a broad view across the processes.  If a specific critical quality characteristic has a high priority relative to other characteristics, a specific process view could be created for that characteristic, including more detailed information and requirements.  Name: Specialty Engineering process View Purpose: The purpose of the Specialty Engineering process View is to provide objective evidence that the system achieves satisfactory levels of certain critical quality characteristics selected for special attention. Outcomes: a) Product critical quality characteristics are selected for special attention. b) Requirements for the achievement of the critical quality characteristics are defined. c) Measures for the requirements are selected and related to the desired critical quality characteristics. d) Approaches for achieving the desired critical quality characteristics are defined and implemented. e) The extent of achievement of the requirements is continually monitored. f) The extent of achievement of the critical quality characteristics are specified and developed. NOTE The outcomes permit the possibility that the desired critical quality characteristics cannot be directly measured but instead might be argued and inferred based on other product or process characteristics that can be measured. Processes, Activities and Tasks: This process view can be implemented using the following processes, activities, and tasks from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288: NOTE 1 ISO/IEC 25030, Software Engineering — Software product quality requirements and evaluation (SQuaRE) — Quality requirements, may be useful in specifying software product quality requirements. NOTE 2 INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook contains descriptions and elaboration about many of the specialty engineering areas and the associated critical quality characteristics.  a) The Business and Mission Analysis process (6.4.1) provides for the definition of the problem space and characterization of the solution space, including the relevant trade-space factors and preliminary life cycle concepts.  This includes developing an understanding of the context and any key parameters, such as the critical quality characteristics (e.g., security threats, safety hazards, human interfaces, operational characteristics, and system assurance context).  Relevant activities and tasks include (b)(1) and (2); (c)(1); and (d)(1). b) The Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process (6.4.2) provides for the selection and definition of characteristics, including critical quality characteristics, and associated information items.

The selected verification strategy may introduce design constraints that could affect the achievement of the characteristics. Relevant activities and tasks include (a)(1) and (3); (b)(1), (2); and (c)(1) and (2). j) The Transition process (6.4.10) provides for installing the system in its operational environment. Because some specialty properties involve a trade-off between design constraints and operational constraints, attention to installation is often important. Relevant activities and tasks include (a)(4); and (b) (4), (6), and (7). k) The Validation process (6.4.11) provides evidence that the services provided by the system meet the stakeholders' needs, including the critical quality characteristics. Relevant activities and tasks include (a)(1) and (3); (b)(1) and (2); (c)(1) and (2). l) The Operation process (6.4.12) provides for usage of the system. Assuring that critical quality characteristics are appropriately achieved involves monitoring the operation of the system. Relevant activities and task include (b)(3) and (4); (c)(1) and (2); and (d)(1) and (2). m) The Maintenance process (6.4.13) sustains the capabilities of the system, helping to ensure its ongoing availability to provide its functions, including its critical quality characteristics.

Architecture and design activities in this version are split in two processes to reflect the different practices in the systems engineering community dealing with complex systems. As one example, an architecture might be followed by different designs for different systems in a product line. In this case it is important to perform these two processes in a separate manner. Furthermore, architecture is often done for other reasons than as the basis for design, such as, for example, to drive technology investments, to adjust corporate portfolio of projects, to guide a bid/no-bid decision, etc. The architecture of a system can be understood as a set of structured architectural entities and of their relationships, such as functions, function flows, interfaces, resource flow items, information/data elements, physical components, containers, nodes, links, communication resources, etc. These architectural entities may possess characteristics such as dimensions, environmental resilience, availability, robustness, execution efficiency, mission effectiveness, etc. F.2  Viewpoints, views and model kinds used in architecture The Architectural Definition process uses a variety of models, including the example models listed in the following section. (Traditional system engineering practice classifies some of these models as “logical models” or “physical models”, but the taxonomical distinction is unnecessary in the application of this International Standard.) A variety of views are used to represent how the system architecture addresses stakeholder concerns. Views are composed of models. Refer to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for definitions of architecture terms and additional detail on architecture concepts and models. F.3  Logical and physical models F.3.1 Functional model  A functional model of the system is a representation of a set of functions that defines the transformations of inputs into outputs performed by the system to achieve its mission or purpose. These functions are determined by how the system is expected to behave when used as intended. Consequently, every system function is associated with an interaction between the system and its environment. Functional, performance, non-functional, and constraint requirements are usually analyzed to determine functions and input-output flows. When functions are associated with system elements, the design definition process will need to determine if each system element has been sufficiently specified to build or buy it. If the system element must be further resolved in order to achieve this sufficiency then the functions associated with the system element will also need be further resolved and properly associated with the sub elements. Typically there are multiple ways to decompose the functions that contributes to the definition of multiple candidate architectures. F.3.2 Behavioral model A behavioral model is an arrangement of functions and interfaces (internal and external) that defines how the system or its elements act under conditions to sustain the operational scenarios, including the execution sequencing and concurrency, the conditions for behavioral change and the performance.  A behavioral model can be described with a set of inter-related scenarios. This includes identifying the behavioral elements (modes/states, transitions, trigger events, operational scenarios, etc.) through the life cycle.

This includes identifying temporal elements (duration, frequency, response time, triggers, timeout, stop conditions, etc.) from the operational concept and system requirements. F.3.4 Structural model A structural model of the system is a representation that shows the arrangement of elements with respect to each other and where necessary shows the interfaces between elements and with external entities. Such a model enables  consolidating or identifying physical interfaces between system elements in a level of the system hierarchy and between levels of the system hierarchy, as well as those with external entities to the concerned system (in its environment/context).  F.3.5 Mass model A mass model of the system is a representation showing the position of physical volumes of system elements or of their parts in the case these are geographically distributed. It could record the expected or actual mass properties to help determine such mass properties as centre of gravity and dynamic behavior of motion. It can also be used to help allocate total system mass to its elements. F.3.6 Layout model A layout model of the system is a representation of where the system elements are placed geographically against each other. In model railroading, a layout model is a diorama containing scale track for operating trains. An automobile layout describes where on the vehicle the engine and drive wheels are found. F.3.7 Network model A network model defines an arrangement of nodes and links to help understand how resources traverse from one node to another. Resources flowing in a network can be mass, energy, data, people, etc. A network model can be used to determine throughput, latency, congestion points, etc. A network model is sometimes modeled along with a protocol stack to understand how layers in a network interact vertically up and down the stack. F.3.8 Other model considerations Stakeholder life cycle concerns such as maintenance, evolution, disposal, potential changes of environment, or obsolescence management, and non-functional requirements, are addressed defining architectural characteristics such as modularity, relative independence, upgradeability, adaptation to several environments, level of effectiveness, reliability, robustness, scalability, or resistance to environmental conditions, etc.  Other necessary models could include some of these characteristics or other critical quality characteristics.  For example, a reliability model could drive the functional level of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA or FMECA) to help deduce potential architectural mitigations to minimize operational risks (mission loss, safety or security) related to critical concerns and functions. Determination of which models to use in system definition can be based on examination of stakeholder concerns. The models and the resulting views can be used to express how the system architecture and design addresses their concerns and to gain better understanding of their actual needs, wants and expectations.  Furthermore, models may be used in other life cycle processes besides architecture and design definition. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, architecture, design, analysis, verification and validation activities throughout the  life cycle.

A SoS brings together a set of systems for a task that none of the systems can accomplish on its own. Each constituent system keeps its own management, goals, and resources while coordinating within the SoS and adapting to meet SoS goals. In the context of terminology discussed in subclause 5.2.3 (as shown in Figure 3), the composite set of systems including the original SOI, enabling systems and interacting systems, together constitute an SoS. Where there are concerns that affect the composite set, the system of systems becomes the SOI, which is considered to satisfy some business or mission objective that cannot be satisfied by the individual constituent systems, or to understand emergent behavior of the combination. This annex addresses the application of system life cycle processes to such SoS. It describes general characteristics, the common types of SoS, and the implications throughout the life cycle. G.2 SoS characteristics and types SoS are characterized by managerial and operational independence of the constituent systems, which in many cases were developed and continue to support originally identified users concurrently with users of the SoS.  In other contexts, each constituent system itself is a SOI; its existence often predates the SoS, while its characteristics were originally engineered to meet the needs of their initial users. As constituents of the SoS, their consideration is expanded to encompass the larger needs of the SoS. This implies added complexity particularly when the systems continue to evolve independently of the SoS. The constituent systems also typically retain their original stakeholders and governance mechanisms, which limits alternatives to address the needs of the SoS. SoS have been characterized into four types based on the governance relationships between the constituent systems and the SoS (Figure G.1). The strongest governance relations apply to directed system of systems, where the SoS organization has authority over the constituent systems despite the fact that the constituent systems may not have originally been engineered to support the SoS.  Somewhat less control is afforded for acknowledged SoS, where allocated authority between the constituent systems and the systems of systems has an impact on application of some of the systems engineering processes.  In collaborative SoS, which lack system of systems authorities, application of systems engineering depends on cooperation among the constituent systems.  Virtual systems of systems are largely self organizing and offer much more limited opportunity for systems engineering of the SoS. Emergence is a key characteristic of SoS – the unanticipated effects at the systems of systems level attributed to the complex interaction dynamics of the constituent systems.  In SoS, constituent systems are intentionally considered in their combination, so as to obtain and analyze outcomes not possible to obtain with the systems alone.  The complexity of the constituent systems and the fact they may have been designed without regard to their role in the SoS, can result in new, unexpected behaviors.  Identifying and addressing unanticipated emergent results is a particular challenge in engineering SoS.

G.3.2 Agreement processes Agreement Processes are crucial for SoS because they establish the modes of developmental and operational control among the organizations responsible for the SoS and the often independent constituent systems.  Constituent systems, which are acquired and managed by different organizations, often hold original objectives that may not align with those of the SoS. Except in the directed SoS case, the SoS organization cannot task a constituent system organization without their cooperation.  In an acknowledged or collaborative SoS, these tasks are balanced against the tasks of the constituent system as a SOI in its own right. For virtual SoS, agreement processes may be informal, or considered only for analysis purposes G.3.3 Organizational project-enabling processes In a typical system-of-interest, Organizational Project-Enabling Processes establish the environment in which projects are conducted. The organization establishes the processes and life cycle models to be used by projects; establishes, redirects, or cancels projects; provides resources required, including human and financial; and sets and monitors the quality measures for systems and other deliverables that are developed by projects for internal and external customers. (Subclause 6.2). In an SoS, the owners of the constituent systems usually retain responsibility for engineering their systems and they each have their own Organizational Project-Enabling Processes.  Depending on the SoS type, the SoS also applies these Organizational Project-Enabling Processes to the particular considerations of the SoS -  planning, analyzing, organizing, and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a SoS capability. Consequently, in SoS these Organizational Project-Enabling Processes are implemented at two levels.  The organizations responsible for the constituent systems implement these processes for their SOI independent of the SoS.  The SoS organization (or in collaborative systems of systems by agreement of the SoS) implement these processes for the SoS for those considerations that apply to the overall SoS.  For example, Human Resource Management is addressed by each constituent system organization for the engineering of their system.  The SoS organization would only address this for the systems engineering activities that apply across the constituent systems to the SoS. A particular challenge in SoS engineering is the lack of alignment among the constituent system Organizational Project-Enabling Processes and those of the SoS.  Constituent systems processes are designed to meet their own outcomes and may not align with those of the SoS.  For example, Portfolio Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with various National Standards BodiesLicensee=Medtronic/5966437005, User=Pope, BenjaminNot for Resale, 03/21/2017 09:20:49 MDTNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS--`,,`,,,`,``,,,`,`,``,``,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015(E)  104 © ISO/IEC 2015 – All rights reserved© IEEE 2015 – All rights reserved Management will be a constituent system responsibility in cases where the constituent system organization has full control over the constituent system and other systems and projects in its portfolio, and the SoS organization will need an approach to Portfolio Management that recognizes this. G.3.4 Technical management processes In a typical system-of-interest, Technical Management Processes are concerned with managing the resources and assets allocated by organization management and with applying them to fulfill the agreements into which the organization or organizations enter.  They relate to the management of projects, in particular to planning in terms of cost, timescales and achievements; to the checking of actions for compliance with plans and performance criteria; and to the identification and selection of corrective actions that recover shortfalls in progress and achievement. They are used to establish and perform technical plans for the project, manage information across the technical team, assess technical progress against the plans for the system products or services, control technical tasks through to completion, and to aid in the decision-making process (subclause 6.3). The Technical Management Processes are also implemented at the level of the SoS and that of the constituent systems. Technical Management Processes are applied to the particular considerations of SoS engineering - planning, analyzing, organizing, and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a system of systems capability. In parallel, the constituent systems organizations retain responsibility for engineering their systems and for their own Technical Management Processes. The SoS organization addresses the Technical Management process as they apply across the SoS, while the processes are also implemented independently in the constituent system organizations. For configuration management for instance, constituent systems manage their own configurations while the SoS addresses configuration management as it applies to the mix of systems in the SoS.  Risk is managed by the constituent systems based on assessment of risk as it applies to their outcomes while the SoS risk management looks at risk to the SoS. Planning and Assessment and Control are key to all management practices (subclause 6.3; page 31); a key challenge in systems of systems engineering is the lack of control by the SoS organization over the processes for the constituent systems (particularly for acknowledged and collaborative SoS). Driven by their own organizational requirements, each of the constituent systems may be on a development or upgrade schedule that differs from the schedules of other constituent systems.  The SoS organization must plan an integrated life cycle that recognizes the independent changes in the constituent systems, in addition to the SoS-initiated changes in a life cycle that treats the SoS as the SOI.  This often involves the definition of stable intermediate forms that punctuate the SoS evolution with incremental capabilities added among the constituent systems. G.3.5 Technical processes Technical Processes are concerned with technical actions throughout the life cycle.  They transform the needs of stakeholders first into a product and then, by applying that product, provide a sustainable service, when and where needed in order to achieve customer satisfaction.  The Technical Processes are applied in order to create and use a system, whether it is in the form of a model or is a finished product, and they apply at any level in a hierarchy of system structure (Subclause 6.4). As with the other processes when applied to SoS, Technical Processes are implemented for both the SoS and constituent systems; in some cases, the SoS implementation is by means of conduct of the constituent system processes rather than for the SoS as a whole. Business or Mission Analysis for an SoS looks across the full SoS business and mission environment.  To the degree the constituent system was developed to operate in that space, the Business or Mission Analysis for the systems of system and constituent systems will be largely shared.  The objective is to determine the best means to provide the desired capability. Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition will focus on the top level SoS, but also consider how the disparate needs of the stakeholders for the individual systems may lead to constraints on the system of systems.

The Architecture for the SoS is a framework for organizing and integrating the capabilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a SoS capability, leaving the architectures of the constituent systems to their organizations.  Because the constituent systems in an SoS usually predate the SoS, SoS Architecture Definition often begins with the de facto architecture of the SoS. Architecture alternatives are then examined in order to frame stakeholder concerns and meet top level system of system requirements, and to recognize the effect of new requirements for the constituent systems and accommodate the constituent system architecture constraints. The Design Definition process provides sufficient detailed data and information to enable the SoS implementation.  This involves collaboration with the constituent systems who will conduct their own design trades to identify the approach to address SoS requirements as they apply to their system.  These are the responsibility of the constituent system organization and Implementation is a done by the constituent system with the SoS organization in a monitoring role. Integration, Verification, Transition, Validation are all done by the constituent systems for the changes they implement to support requirements generated by the SoS.  These processes also apply to the SoS when the upgraded constituent systems are integrated into the SoS and performance is verified and validated.  The independent and asynchronous nature of constituent systems in an SoS pose challenges to effective implementation of these processes as implemented in a traditional SOI.  It may be that the SoS-level evaluations can only be performed in the operational environment, in which case precautionary measures should be considered to avoid adverse SoS-behavior. Finally, the Operations, Maintenance and Disposal Processes tend to be implemented by the constituent systems, given their management and operational independence.  There may be SoS-level interactions to facilitate those processes.

Official statements  A statement, written or oral, that is not processed in accordance with the IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual shall not be considered or inferred to be the official position of IEEE or any of its committees and shall not be considered to be, or be relied upon as, a formal position of IEEE. At lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational courses, an individual presenting information on IEEE standards shall make it clear that his or her views should be considered the personal views of that individual rather than the formal position of IEEE. Comments on standards Comments for revision of IEEE Standards documents are welcome from any interested party, regardless of membership affiliation with IEEE. However, IEEE does not provide consulting information or advice pertaining to IEEE Standards documents. Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with appropriate supporting comments. Since IEEE standards represent a consensus of concerned interests, it is important that any responses to comments and questions also receive the concurrence of a balance of interests. For this reason, IEEE and the members of its societies and Standards Coordinating Committees are not able to provide an instant response to comments or questions except in those cases where the matter has previously been addressed. For the same reason, IEEE does not respond to interpretation requests. Any person who would like to participate in revisions to an IEEE standard is welcome to join the relevant IEEE working group. Comments on standards should be submitted to the following address:  Secretary, IEEE-SA Standards Board  445 Hoes Lane  Piscataway, NJ  08854 USA Photocopies Subject to payment of the appropriate fee, IEEE will grant users a limited, non-exclusive license to photocopy portions of any individual standard for company or organizational internal use or individual, non-commercial use only.

It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. This International Standard also provides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the life cycle processes used within an organization or a project. Organizations and projects can use these life cycle processes when acquiring and supplying systems. This International Standard concerns those systems that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities. When a system element is software, the software life cycle processes documented in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 may be used to implement that system element. The two standards are harmonized for concurrent use on a single project or in a single organization. When the system element is hardware, refer to other International Standards outside the scope of SC7.

ISO 15225-2010 Medical Device Nomenclature Data Structure.pdf,"Association for the Advancementof Medical InstrumentationANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010Medical devices — Quality management — Medicaldevice nomenclature data structureAAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016Objectives and uses of AAMI standards and recommended practices   It is most important that the objectives and potential uses of an AAMI product standard or recommended practice are clearly understood. The objectives of AAMI's technical development program derive from AAMI's overall mission: the advancement of medical instrumentation. Essential to such advancement are (1) a continued increase in the safe and effective application of current technologies to patient care, and (2) the encouragement of new technologies. It is AAMI's view that standards and recommended practices can contribute significantly to the advancement of medical instrumentation, provided that they are drafted with attention to these objectives and provided that arbitrary and restrictive uses are avoided. A voluntary standard for a medical device recommends to the manufacturer the information that should be provided with or on the product, basic safety and performance criteria that should be considered in qualifying the device for clinical use, and the measurement techniques that can be used to determine whether the device conforms with the safety and performance criteria and/or to compare the performance characteristics of different products. Some standards emphasize the information that should be provided with the device, including performance characteristics, instructions for use, warnings and precautions, and other data considered important in ensuring the safe and effective use of the device in the clinical environment. Recommending the disclosure of performance characteristics often necessitates the development of specialized test methods to facilitate uniformity in reporting; reaching consensus on these tests can represent a considerable part of committee work. When a drafting committee determines that clinical concerns warrant the establishment of minimum safety and performance criteria, referee tests must be provided and the reasons for establishing the criteria must be documented in the rationale.  A recommended practice provides guidelines for the use, care, and/or processing of a medical device or system. A recommended practice does not address device performance per se, but rather procedures and practices that will help ensure that a device is used safely and effectively and that its performance will be maintained. Although a device standard is primarily directed to the manufacturer, it may also be of value to the potential purchaser or user of the device as a frame of reference for device evaluation. Similarly, even though a recommended practice is usually oriented towards healthcare professionals, it may be useful to the manufacturer in better understanding the environment in which a medical device will be used. Also, some recommended practices, while not addressing device performance criteria, provide guidelines to industrial personnel on such subjects as sterilization processing, methods of collecting data to establish safety and efficacy, human engineering, and other processing or evaluation techniques; such guidelines may be useful to health care professionals in understanding industrial practices. In determining whether an AAMI standard or recommended practice is relevant to the specific needs of a potential user of the document, several important concepts must be recognized: All AAMI standards and recommended practices are voluntary (unless, of course, they are adopted by government regulatory or procurement authorities). The application of a standard or recommended practice is solely within the discretion and professional judgment of the user of the document. Each AAMI standard or recommended practice reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care professionals and industrial representatives, whose work has been reviewed nationally (and sometimes internationally). As such, the consensus recommendations embodied in a standard or recommended practice are intended to respond to clinical needs and, ultimately, to help ensure patient safety. A standard or recommended practice is limited, however, in the sense that it responds generally to perceived risks and conditions that may not always be relevant to specific situations. A standard or recommended practice is an important reference in responsible decision-making, but it should never replace responsible decision-making. Despite periodic review and revision (at least once every five years), a standard or recommended practice is necessarily a static document applied to a dynamic technology. Therefore, a standards user must carefully review the reasons why the document was initially developed and the specific rationale for each of its provisions. This review will reveal whether the document remains relevant to the specific needs of the user. Particular care should be taken in applying a product standard to existing devices and equipment, and in applying a recommended practice to current procedures and practices. While observed or potential risks with existing equipment typically form the basis for the safety and performance criteria defined in a standard, professional judgment must be used in applying these criteria to existing equipment. No single source of information will serve to identify a particular product as ""unsafe"". A voluntary standard can be used as one resource, but the ultimate decision as to product safety and efficacy must take into account the specifics of its utilization and, of course, cost-benefit considerations. Similarly, a recommended practice should be analyzed in the context of the specific needs and resources of the individual institution or firm. Again, the rationale accompanying each AAMI standard and recommended practice is an excellent guide to the reasoning and data underlying its provision. In summary, a standard or recommended practice is truly useful only when it is used in conjunction with other sources of information and policy guidance and in the context of professional experience and judgment.  INTERPRETATIONS OF AAMI STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES  Requests for interpretations of AAMI standards and recommended practices must be made in writing, to the AAMI Vice President, Standards Policy and Programs. An official interpretation must be approved by letter ballot of the originating committee and subsequently reviewed and approved by the AAMI Standards Board. The interpretation will become official and representation of the Association only upon exhaustion of any appeals and upon publication of notice of interpretation in the ""Standards Monitor"" section of the AAMI News. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation disclaims responsibility for any characterization or explanation of a standard or recommended practice which has not been developed and communicated in accordance with this procedure and which is not published, by appropriate notice, as an official interpretation in the AAMI News.

The United States is one of the ISO members that took an active role in the development of this standard.  International standard ISO 15225:2010 was developed by Technical Committee ISO/TC 210, Quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices to provide rules and guidelines for a medical device nomenclature data structure in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange of data used by regulatory bodies on an international level between interested parties such as regulatory authorities, manufacturers, suppliers, health care providers, and end users.  U.S. participation in this ISO TC is organized through the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for ISO/TC 210, administered by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. The U.S. made a considerable contribution to this International Standard.  AAMI encourages its committees to harmonize their work with International Standards in the area of quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices.  Upon review of ISO 15225, the Quality Management and Corresponding General Aspects for Medical Devices Committee and the AAMI Symbols and Nomenclature Working Group decided to adopt it verbatim, as a revision of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2000/(R)2006 and its 2004 amendment.  This edition of ISO 15225 has been technically revised from the previous edition and includes definitions for base concept, collective term, device category, device type, generic device group, GMDN, GMDN agency, multiple-linked synonym, product specifier and template specifier.  Annex A contains three new codes and updated descriptions based on examples of new technologies.  Annex D has been added which contains examples of collective terms.     AAMI and ANSI procedures require that standards be reviewed and, if necessary, revised every five years to reflect technological advances that may have occurred since publication.  AAMI (and ANSI) have adopted other ISO standards. See the Glossary of Equivalent Standards for a list of ISO standards adopted by AAMI, which gives the corresponding U.S. designation and the level of equivalency with the ISO standard.  As used within the context of this document, “shall” indicates requirements strictly to be followed to conform to the recommended practice. “Should” indicates that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action should be avoided but is not prohibited. “May” is used to indicate that a course of action is permissible within the limits of the recommended practice. “Can” is used as a statement of possibility and capability. Finally, “must” is used only to describe “unavoidable” situations, including those mandated by government regulation.  The concepts incorporated in this standard should not be considered inflexible or static. This standard, like any other, must be reviewed and updated periodically to assimilate progressive technological developments. To remain relevant, it must be modified as technological advances are made and as new data comes to light.  Suggestions for improving this standard are invited. Comments and suggested revisions should be sent to Standards Department, AAMI, 4301 N. Fairfax Dr. Suite 301, Arlington, VA 22203-1633. NOTE—Beginning with the ISO foreword on page ix, this American National Standard is identical to ISO 15225:2010.   viii  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO 15225 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 210, Quality management and corresponding general aspects for medical devices. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 15225:2000), which has been technically revised. It also incorporates the Amendment ISO 15225:2000/Amd.1:2004.  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  ix AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Introduction This International Standard is intended to assist competent authorities, conformity assessment bodies, healthcare providers and manufacturers in the submission and exchange of information. It is intended that the information covered by this International Standard be available in the public domain. This second edition of this International Standard is based on experience gained from utilization of the first edition. The following major changes have been made to the first edition: ⎯ definitions have been added in Clause 3 for base concept, collective term, device category, device type, generic device group, Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN), GMDN agency, multiple-linked synonym, product specifier and template specifier; ⎯ Codes 13, 14 and 15 have been added in Annex A, and the descriptions have been updated with examples of new technologies; ⎯ Annex D has been added containing examples of collective terms. The requirements contained in this International Standard are applicable to the development and updating of an international nomenclature and have been prepared specifically for construction of the Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN).  x  © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 American National Standard ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010 Medical devices — Quality management — Medical device nomenclature data structure 1 Scope This International Standard provides rules and guidelines for a medical device nomenclature data structure, in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange of data used by regulatory bodies on an international level between interested parties, e.g. regulatory authorities, manufacturers, suppliers, health care providers and end users.

These stages differ in the breadth of the sets of devices represented by the terms defined within each stage. All medical devices can be classified within each stage. The stages have a relational structure in the following order: a) device category (see 4.2); b) collective term (see 4.3); c) generic device group (see 4.4); d) device type (see 4.5). 4.2 Device category Individual categories have broad usage definitions representing disparate devices that have common areas of intended use or common technology. Device category has the largest number of devices covered by each term. For data organization, device category includes the record holding a device category term and associated data, such as its code and other attributes. 4.3 Collective term Collective terms are terms used in the nomenclature for: a) grouping together preferred terms with common characteristics, e.g. common technology, materials, medical specialties, manufacturing processes; NOTE  Collective terms can replace or support template terms. b) illustrating the scope of certificates issued by certification bodies when assessing which groups, families or types of medical devices are covered within a manufacturer’s quality system; c) identifying the range of skills and general technological abilities for which a notified body has been approved, and is so appointed by the relevant regulatory authority; d) exchanging of information between regulatory authorities when general information on individual manufacturers capabilities is notified for inclusion within data-exchange systems. Collective terms are linked directly to preferred terms. 4.4 Generic device group A generic device group contains sets of devices having the same or similar intended uses or commonality of technology. Sets of devices are grouped together for the purpose of device vigilance reporting, or other purposes where sets of essentially similar devices from different sources need to be collected. Potentially, any device attribute (e.g. implant/non-implant, sterile/non-sterile) can be used as a means of arranging associated data. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  5 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 For data organization, the generic device group includes the record holding a device group term. The device group term can include the following: a) preferred term (see 5.2.3); b) template term (see 5.2.4); c) synonym (see 5.2.5); d) multiple-linked synonym (see 5.2.6). It can also include associated data, as follows: ⎯ code; ⎯ definition; ⎯ for synonyms or multiple-linked synonyms, code of the generic device group record holding the preferred term or template term; ⎯ for templates, the template specifier. 4.5 Device type A device type contains individual medical devices including devices intended for clinical investigation, devices intended for performance evaluation and custom-made devices or sets of medical devices including variants which may be produced. Device types contain sufficient characteristics in common for the manufacturer to establish a make and model. For data organization, device type includes the record holding the device type designation and its associated data, such as its code and other attributes. Names to be stored are drawn from the manufacturer’s documentation. 4.6 Nomenclature structure example Table 1 is an example of the nomenclature structure. 6 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 Table 1 — Example of GMDN structure linked to an alignment rod Device categories: 03 Dental devices 09 Reusable devices Links to - -   Collective terms:   CT465 Cranial surgery  CT146 Dentistry  CT317 Infant/pediatric  CT321 Long-term surgical invasive  CT326 Manually powered/operated  CT177 Metals  CT328 Natural orifice  CT166 Oral surgical fixation/distraction and ancillary  CT152 Pediatrics  CT982 Reusable  CT335 Single purpose  CT334 Single-patient use  CT337 Sterilizable  CT233 Surgery Links to - -  Generic device group: GMDN code:47677 Term: Craniofacial alignment rod Definition: A surgical instrument typically used in pairs to facilitate correct cranial orientation of craniofacial implants (e.g., fixation plates being attached to jaw bones) and other devices (e.g. craniofacial distractors) during their application in craniofacial surgery. It is typically designed as a long, thin, rigid rod made of high-grade stainless steel or titanium alloy with connectors at either end for attachment to the devices being aligned; it may have a knurled mid section (to provide better grip) onto which other instruments can be locked to assist the orientation procedure. This is a reusable device.

The list is not exhaustive, other device categories may be added (see Annex A). © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  7 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 5.2 Generic device group 5.2.1 General Generic device groups are managed by the GMDN agency and are part of the data file. For the generation of generic device group terms, see Annex B. A generic device group can be a member of more than one device category. The nomenclature shall consist of preferred terms, template terms, synonyms and multiple-linked synonyms. All terms should be given in the singular form. 5.2.2 Abbreviations and acronyms Abbreviations and acronyms can be used to create generic device group names. Any abbreviation being adopted should use widely recognized terminology. 5.2.3 Preferred term A preferred term represents a device type or a set of device types that perform similar or equivalent functions or have technical characteristics in common. A preferred term is the only term that can be used for product identification. A preferred term shall be unambiguous and comprise the following: a) base concept; b) (if appropriate) one or more qualifiers following the base concept, and which are separated from the base concept by a comma; c) a comma and one space to delimit each qualifier. EXAMPLE Brachytherapy system applicator, remote afterloading, bladder. More specific classification can be achieved by addition of further qualifiers. The base concept shall be the primary listing basis. Unambiguous qualifiers shall be used. Ambiguous qualifiers include phrases such as “sundries”, “others”, “appliances”, “miscellaneous” and “various”. Trade names shall not be used as preferred terms. Preferred terms shall be assigned a definition of not more than 700 characters. 5.2.4 Template terms A template term is used when more than two preferred terms are formed using the same base concept. 8 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 The template term shall be formed from the common base concept followed by the qualifier <specify>. A template term functions only as a navigational term within the nomenclature. Its permanency cannot be guaranteed due to preferred term development. Template terms cannot be used for product identification. Template terms shall not be used as synonyms. Template terms shall be assigned a definition of not more than 700 characters. 5.2.5 Synonyms Synonyms shall be linked to only one preferred term or to one template term, whichever is appropriate. Synonyms are an aid to locating the appropriate preferred term. Synonym terms cannot be used for product identification. Synonyms shall not be linked to other synonyms. 5.2.6 Multiple-linked synonyms A multiple-linked synonym is a term that is typically of a higher order, and can therefore be linked to more than one preferred term, or template term, or preferred term and template term. EXAMPLE 1 Higher order terms EDMA term: Thyroid Function Hormones GMDN related terms: Triiodothyronine uptake kit  Thyroxine kit  Triiodothyronine kit  Free triiodothyronine kit  Free thyroxine kit. EXAMPLE 2 Combination product terms UMDNS term: Reagents, Staphylococcus/Streptococcus Detection GMDN related terms:  Staphylococcus kit  Streptococcus antibody kit  Streptococcus antigen kit. A multiple-linked synonym shall have the same construction format and status as a synonym term. Multiple-linked synonym terms may not be used for the purpose of product identification. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  9 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 5.3 Device type Device types are used to identify a manufacturer’s specific product (i.e. make and model) and are managed by, or on behalf of, the device manufacturer. A device type shall not be linked to more than one preferred term. Device types shall be designated under the code of a preferred term, in accordance with the primary intended uses specified by the manufacturer. 5.4 Collective term Collective terms shall group several preferred terms with common features (see 4.3). Collective terms are managed by the GMDN Agency and are part of the data file. See Annex D. 6 Data file dictionary 6.1 General This clause is provided for information system designers implementing the nomenclature within a database. It provides the minimum requirements for the data fields needed to hold the nomenclature system. Each stage in the data structure is represented by a data file for which the requirements of 6.2 to 6.5 apply. Further data fields may be added to all data files depending on the requirements of the end user of the database system in question. The character set for transmissions shall be the Latin alphabet No. 1 as specified in ISO/IEC 8859-1. 6.2 Device category data file The minimum number of fields shall be as specified in Table 2. The rationale for having two primary keys is that the code will be used to facilitate automatic translation between natural language versions of the terms stored in this data file. See Annex A for examples. When information is exchanged and records in the data files described in Table 2 are part of this information, then only the code of the relevant records needs to be transmitted. Table 2 — Requirements for device category data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Code Numeric, two digits Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 60 characters Primary key Definition Alphanumeric, 1,260 characters — 10 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016  6.3 Generic device group data file The data field code shall be assigned an incremental sequential cardinal number starting from the value 10,000. After a new record is added to the data file, the code shall be incremented by one (1). The generic device group data file shall be as specified in Table 3. Table 3 — Requirements for generic device group data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Code Numeric, five digits Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 120 charactersPrimary key Synonym code Numeric, five digits If not equal to zero (nil) then this device group is a synonym where the numeric value is the code of the preferred term or template. Template specifier Numeric, two digits If not equal to zero (nil) then this device group is a template. The numeric value represents how many characters from the term are to be used for looking up (listing) the matching preferred term base concept. Definition Alphanumeric, max 700 characters See also 5.2. Product specifier Alpha, 30 characters The text “product identifier” or “not for product identification” is linked to all terms to make it clear tothe nomenclature user which terms are allowed for product identification and which are not. NOTE Annex C gives examples of device group records.  The rationale for having two primary keys is that the code will be used to facilitate automatic translation between natural language versions of the terms stored in this data file. There is no foreign key in this data file relating it to the device category data file, since there is a many-to-many relation between these two data files. The system designer should apply the method(s) available in the database tool in order to achieve this many-to-many relation, the most common method being a data file holding as foreign keys the codes of both the device category and generic device group records. The code of the generic device group’s records, where the synonym code or the template specifier is not zero (nil), shall not be used as a foreign key in related data files. These records may not be available in all natural language versions of the nomenclature system and in such cases no relation will exist (see Annex C). Generic device group codes in the range 1 to 9,999 cannot be used in data transmissions that comply with this International Standard. This demands that an official list of generic device groups will never contain records having these code values. Generic device group codes in the range 1 to 9,999 are exclusively reserved for assignment by the end user. These codes are made available for the convenience of end users to store terms outside the scope of this International Standard. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  11 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 6.4 Device type data file The minimum number of fields shall be as specified in Table 4. Table 4 — Requirements for device type data file Identifier Data category and format Comments Generic device group code Numeric, five digits Foreign key, represents the link to a generic device group record (preferred term in the nomenclature) Make Alphanumeric, 60 characters Secondary key, can also act as a foreign key Model Alphanumeric, 60 characters The make and model represents, when concatenated, the primary key When concatenated (see Table 4) the contents of the data fields “make” and “model” shall be unique. The data field “make” is used to identify the manufacturer on the device label. When appropriate, the authorized representative may be identified. A shortened version, such as an easily recognizable trade name or alpha-numeric trade mark, may be used. The data field model should be the name used by the manufacturer to identify the particular type of device. In appropriate circumstances, other informative formats, such as brand or bar code data, may be used. This data field should not be confused with the serial number or lot number assigned to the individual device or lots of devices. The reasoning for having two data fields representing the primary key is that the model name used by one manufacturer (or even by the same manufacturer when he uses several makes to represent his name) could possibly be used by other manufacturers, thus making it unsuitable for use as a primary key. The system designer may find it useful to assign a single (numeric) data field as a more manageable primary key in the database system for this data file. Each device type record should be supported by a unique code for data transmission. If it is considered of value to include device risk class data, this should be limited to links at the device type. Risk classification at the generic device group level is not considered in this International Standard. 6.5 Collective term data file The minimum number of identifiers shall be as specified in Table 5. Table 5 — Requirements for collective term data file Identifier Data category and format (maximum) Comments Code Alphanumeric, six characters Primary key Term Alphanumeric, 150 characters Primary key Definition Alpha, 300 characters —  The collective term code consists of two alpha characters, followed by up to four numeric characters.

The terms used in the examples provided are for illustrative purposes. B.2 Structure of generic device group terms The preferred term should be of such a character that the nomenclature acquires a functional architecture, bearing in mind the users and use of the device. The qualifier, especially when common to many terms, may be based on the properties, characteristics or field of use of the devices, by using well-established conventions when appropriate. The general structure of the preferred term is the base concept (singular noun or noun phrase), followed by one or more qualifiers (adjectives or adjectival phrases), delimited or separated by a comma. The base concept is the broadest representation of the generic device group of medical devices that is further described by the qualifiers. The qualifiers, moving from left to right, should be ordered from broader (less specific) to narrower (more specific). B.3 Examples of generic device group terms B.3.1 A preferred term should be constructed in the following manner: Base concept qualifier qualifier Noun or noun phrase adjective or adjectival phrase adjective or adjectival phrase  B.3.2 The following are examples of preferred terms structured by base concept followed by qualifier. EXAMPLE 1 Suture, nylon. EXAMPLE 2 Suture, polyethylene. EXAMPLE 3 Suture, polyglyconate. © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  17 AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 B.3.3 The following are examples of preferred terms using a qualifier which reflects the “field of use” of the devices to be named by the term. EXAMPLE 1 Hemofiltration system. EXAMPLE 2 Peritoneal dialysis system. EXAMPLE 3 Hemodialysis system. EXAMPLE 4 Hemodialysis system air bubble/foam guard. EXAMPLE 5 Hemodialysis system bicarbonate mixer. B.3.4 Where there are more than two preferred terms with the same base concept, a template may be introduced. EXAMPLE 1 Audiometer, <specify>. EXAMPLE 2 Audiometer, auditory evoked response. EXAMPLE 3 Audiometer, automatic-recording. EXAMPLE 4 Audiometer, computer-controlled. B.3.5 The following are examples of synonyms: EXAMPLE 1 Dinamap “linked to” Sphygmomanometer, electronic, <specify> EXAMPLE 2 AED (automatic external defibrillator) “linked to” Defibrillator, automatic EXAMPLE 3 Ambu bag “linked to” Resuscitator, pulmonary, <specify> B.3.6 Any definition should be written in a manner that makes it comprehensible to all nomenclature users. EXAMPLE 1 Audiometer, <specify> An electroacoustic device designed for the measurement of hearing, most commonly for measuring the hearing threshold level. It uses controlled levels of test tones and signals to conduct diagnostic hearing evaluations and assist in the diagnosis of possible otological disorders. EXAMPLE 2 Audiometer, automatic, computer-controlled An electroacoustic device designed to measure the hearing threshold of a patient by presenting tones of increasing or decreasing intensity through headphones to establish the level at which the patient first becomes aware of the sounds. A computer or microprocessor in the device automatically produces tones that sweep the audiometric scale and controls tone intensity and frequency. The device also records the patient's responses and may display calculated hearing thresholds. This device may have the capacity to present a fixed frequency or a steadily changing frequency. It may also provide both continuous and pulsed tone outputs. 18 © 2010 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ■ ANSI/AAMI/ISO 15225:2010  AAMI eSubscription (powered by Edaptive Technologies) - Benjamin Pope - 08/16/2016 B.4 Abbreviations The following are examples of abbreviations used in, or as part of, a synonym: EXAMPLE 1 AARK (automated anaesthesia record keeper).
